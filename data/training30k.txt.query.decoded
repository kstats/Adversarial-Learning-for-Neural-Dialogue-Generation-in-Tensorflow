but if it 's your family crest how can kahn 's side have it too ?
my father is an elder god
and only they can bestow such a UNknown
your dad 's an elder god ?
funny how you failed to mention that before
if your father 's an elder god what does that make kahn ?
UNknown kahn is my brother
it was not my fault
i did everything you ordered
it was your job to lure them to an ambush
if they escaped then you failed me !
we could never have stopped them alone
you are already dead !
and you will be soon
you will mount a defense around my newest temple
prepare for UNknown to make one last attack
you said UNknown was no longer to be feared
i am to be feared !
for if you fail me now
i will feed your rotting corpse to the worms !
your hallowed position UNknown the worm pile appears to be most UNknown
now your failure will be my opportunity
man you got one UNknown family you know that
years ago my father decreed that his heir to the family throne must be strong enough to kill his own brother in battle if necessary
i beat my brother but i could not kill him
only one thing is certain
this time you 'r e going to kill him
so what do we do ?
you will do your best
it is all that can be expected
i will pray for you all
liu is our only hope
i want to fight kahn but i don 't know if i 'm ready
you must believe in yourself liu
there 's so no time left
whatever time we have we must use well
are we really ready to die here ?
so good of you to join us son
in less than one hour the merger of UNknown will be complete
i do not want to remember you this weak !
it is not weak to value life !
i offer you one final chance to return to my side UNknown
to rule all UNknown with your family
then you shall die with the rest of your pathetic human race !
you should UNknown e killed me when you had the chance brother
my brother died a long time ago
this is the beginning of the end !
show them the way to oblivion !
i UNknown l take my mother
leftovers are fine with me
yeah i 'm ma make you eat that thing
i can 't take too much more of this
is that all you got ?
is that any way to treat your mother ?
as soon will be her daughter
that just leaves you and me kahn
clearly UNknown has UNknown you in his image
without your weapons you are no match for UNknown
so you finally got your confidence back huh ?
finally asked for help huh ?
whatever you are you will live to see the end of kahn to give my mother 's soul peace
i can feel it !
you UNknown e come prepared
how can this be ?
i warned you there would be consequences for breaking the sacred rules
but i did not expect this
must i do everything for you ?
the fate of the universe will be decided as it should be
nothing can alter your destiny nor mine !
i can and i will !
that was the longest week of my life
could UNknown e been worse
could UNknown e been the last week of our lives
yeah i guess that 's right
what 's up with that ?
it is only right that UNknown 's son be allowed to take his place in the eternal palace
you UNknown e become one of us
i will never forget this moment liu
you UNknown e all made me very proud
i will be watching you so stay out of trouble
and remember be there for one another
you 'r e a family now

all UNknown air units a UNknown is in progress in the c 13 district UNknown newport city
all UNknown air units a UNknown is in progress in the c 13 district of newport city
there 's no need for concern
we can fix it by UNknown it in our country
a program with no bugs doesn 't exist and there 's no program that is impossible to UNknown
we 'r e not even sure that project UNknown really is a bug
originally the purpose of this project was to
yeah i can hear you
there 's a lot of noise in your brain
it 's my time of the month
don 't you think there 's going to be trouble if we interfere with a section 6 case
the target is a UNknown bad diplomat the best they can do is UNknown him
we 'r e the ones who get our hands dirty it 's time
who told you to fire ? !
put your guns down !
i 'm entitled to diplomatic immunity
i want to talk to the person in charge
taking classified UNknown out of the country UNknown national security
we can also have you brought up on kidnapping charges so let him go
i don 't have to explain
my country has the right in accordance with international law to offer anyone protection and safe passage
the affidavit is at the embassy
i UNknown l send you a copy in a couple of days
you UNknown l be killed if you return
i 'm warning you to watch your comments
our country is a peace loving democracy
so what business brings the chief of section 9 to the ministry of foreign affairs
it 's about the secret talks scheduled with the gavel republic tomorrow
oh the official development assistance
the regime that took over gavel after the revolution demands financial aid supposedly for UNknown
they boast about democracy but they 'r e no better than the last lot
what 's the ministry going to do ?
well there 's a problem
the leader of the former junta that controlled their country is here seeking political asylum
you mean colonel UNknown correct ?
yes and that means we either deny gavel the funds and treat UNknown as a political refuge or help them and kick him out
it 's a tricky situation
my personal opinion is if we could find a politically acceptable reason
i 'd like to forcibly UNknown him immediately
by the way i want to thank you for your help with that other political asylum situation
nakamura from section 6 was also grateful
we UNknown e lost response
what 's happened to the UNknown output
it 's normal i UNknown l switch to UNknown mode
the foreign minister 's interpreter
23 minutes ago her brain was hacked into through a phone line
foreign intelligence warned us about this
the puppet master has begun to UNknown UNknown throughout our network
we believe it 's extremely likely that he UNknown l target the secret talks scheduled with the republic of gavel
we UNknown e put everyone attending the talks under surveillance
i suspect once he hacked into her ghost he 'd use her to assassinate key delegates
so how long do we have before this UNknown breaks through her barrier program and reaches her ghost ?
he 's using an old fashioned ha 3 virus
after that we UNknown l have to break the connection to avoid any danger
that infamous mystery UNknown the puppet master has shown up here ?
we guess he or she is american but we have no clue about age sex or background
since last winter he 's been popping up in UNknown countries
he 's wanted for crimes including stock UNknown illegal information gathering political UNknown computer UNknown UNknown and is under suspicion for several other crimes
he 's on the international most wanted list
the nickname puppet master comes from the ghost UNknown
it 's the first time he 's appeared in this country
well if he 's so skilled how come he 's using an UNknown ha 3 virus ?
a more current technique would be harder to detect and trace but it might also arouse suspicion about colonel UNknown role in this affair
are you saying he 's using an old method just so no one suspects UNknown ?
or maybe UNknown is just a pawn used to make us think that
maybe there is another sponsor
now you 'r e stretching it
i hear it in my ghost
are you still using that revolver ?
you should stop worrying about the UNknown UNknown up
stopping power is more important than your taste in guns
i want to ask you something
why did you transfer a guy like me from the police force ?
because we need a guy like you
you 'r e an honest cop who 's never stepped out of line and you 'r e a family man
except for the slight brain UNknown your body 's almost completely human
no matter how excellent identical standard systems have faults
what 's true for the group is also true for the individual
over specialize and you breed in weakness
it 's a slow death
i UNknown l be right there !
we 'r e already 40 seconds late !
i UNknown l be done in 5 seconds
my last partner who got busted workin as an illegal alien was a lot better than you
you 'r e that desperate to find out your wife 's feelings you 'd ghost hack her ?
she hardly talks to me and all of a sudden she wants a divorce !
what 's worse my daughter UNknown me and got it into her head that i 'm the one cheating on her mom
how did you get your hands on a barrier breaker ?
from this really nice UNknown i met in a bar
he overheard my sob story
my wife 's lawyer stopped me from seeing her and my daughter
he showed me how to hack in from different places along the route without being traced
are you trying to kill yourself asshole ? !
looks like we 'r e not the only ones in a hurry round here
every time we get to the source they 'r e already long gone
we 'r e just wasting our time
hey pop did you see the trash truck ?
who wants to know ?
did you see it or not ?
can 't you take this ?
it changes location every 7 minutes
hq patch me into info from the sanitation department network
8 trucks are on duty in the surveillance area
the target is number 79 a type c vehicle
they might have contacted someone
follow them but take no action
we UNknown e got the data on the refuse connection points
they all UNknown to locations where we traced the calls
the target has now stopped at the next point
how about if i pick up the trash and you make the calls on the second round ?
how do you think ?
ain 't no way i 'm gonna be your partner in crime
you got any children ?
then you can 't understand
she 's like an angel
i 'm not interested in crap like that
yeah vehicle 79 ah boss
what do the cops want to know our rounds for ?
how would i know ?
i UNknown e got to warn that guy who helped me
target has UNknown from route and is heading toward the next pickup point
there 's no way they spotted me following them
they probably traced me when i UNknown the sanitation department network
next time use a back door
forget it just arrest them
christ he 's fucked up the armored van
he 's got high velocity bullets
they UNknown l go straight through your car door
UNknown ammo in a UNknown gun ?
he 's even wearing some kind of UNknown UNknown
that 's what happens when you use UNknown bullets
the breach and barrel are really screwed up
you don 't even know your own name you dick head
can you remember your mother 's face or where you were born ?
do you have any childhood memories ?
do you remember anything ?
puppets without their ghosts are so pathetic
especially those covered in blood
we 'i i enter after the passengers have gone in
squad b comes in from the back the rest of you go in the front
chief a message from hq
we UNknown e id 'd the man the major caught
so who is he ?
he claims to be UNknown gen fang age 28
with a record UNknown immigration law UNknown and illegal possession of firearms
he went into hiding at the end of last month
a member of a UNknown UNknown organization
about a week ago the military attached of the republic UNknown gavel 's embassy commissioned him to attack the UNknown secret meeting
occupation a rather violent trader in questionable goods
we UNknown e checked his police records but can 't UNknown any connection with UNknown
this guy 's just another puppet controlled by the puppet master
how 's UNknown doing ?
he 's back and UNknown that garbage collector with UNknown
so how about the puppet master ?
what 's he like ?
he 's like a puppet himself
squads a and c okay
what 's a simulated experience again ?
well all your memories about your wife daughter and divorce are false
you were used by someone to ghost hack into some government officials
but that can 't be
i went to your home it 's a bachelor 's apartment
i rented it after we separated
you UNknown e been living there for 1 o years
you UNknown e never had a wife or kid
this is the photo you showed your co worker
who do you see ?
it was a picture of my daughter
what 's her name ?
who do you see in the photo ?
lf it 's all a lie when will i get my old memory back ?
UNknown with our current technology only 2 successful cases have ever been reported so i wouldn 't recommend trying to
even simulated experiences and dreams exist as information and are simultaneously reality and fantasy
the information that people UNknown in their life is just a drop in bucket
what 's a UNknown doing going diving in her spare time ?
how long have you been doing it ?
aren 't you afraid of the sea ?
what if the UNknown don 't work ?
i suppose i UNknown l die
or maybe you 'd save me
so what 's it like to swim in the sea ?
you UNknown e done the underwater training course
i 'm not talking about a damn pool
i feel fear anxiety isolation and darkness
in those deep dark waters ?
when i float back to the surface i imagine i 'm becoming someone else
it 's probably the UNknown
do you want to quit section 9 ?
how much of your body is original ?
the chemical UNknown in our bodies can sober us up in seconds
that 's why we can drink while waiting for orders
so what if we can 't survive without regular high level maintenance
who are we to complain ?
we can quit but we 'd have to give back our UNknown parts and UNknown brains to the government
all UNknown that make up me as an individual
there are countless ingredients that make up the human body and mind
a face and voice to distinguish oneself from others the hand you see when you wake up your childhood memories and feelings about your future
and that 's not all
there 's also the ability to access vast amounts of information from an infinite network
all of that UNknown to create a mixture that forms me and gives rise to my conscience
at the same time though i feel continually confined within boundaries
so that 's the reason you risk your body diving in the sea !
what the hell can you see at the bottom in that darkness ?
now it 's like we 'r e looking through a mirror
and what we see is a dim image
connection check to backup brain okay
visual UNknown are back on line
and its body functions ?
and its body functions ?
come to my office in 3 minutes
i guess i UNknown l bring the UNknown up to speed
about 2 hours ago a UNknown cell at the UNknown factory in newport assembled a UNknown body on its own UNknown
when the UNknown arrived the body had already fled
we put out UNknown and initiated a UNknown search
a truck driver reported he 'd run over a naked woman on the highway
and the body was brought here
UNknown is contracted by the government
all their UNknown bodies are classified
we UNknown e a UNknown good enough to get past the best defenses but that 's not the only problem
of course there isn 't a human brain cell in its head but there appears to be a ghost present in its auxiliary brain
it resembles a ghost line that occurs when a real ghost is copied
but there 's no evidence of the UNknown that 's usually UNknown
in any case until we chart the ghost sector and dive into it we can 't be sure
nobody really believes there 's a ghost in that body do they ?
even a plastic doll can have a soul
consider all the UNknown UNknown devices that are crammed into that body
i wouldn 't be surprised if there were some sort of ghost in there too
as you 'r e new you don 't know but major UNknown 's body was also made by UNknown
not only her also parts of me UNknown and saito
we also receive regular UNknown maintenance from them
apart from you and the chief the whole section comes with a UNknown
a sure way to draw attention to oneself
what 's the logic here ?
theft isn 't the issue here
lock down other highly classified UNknown similar to UNknown 's
UNknown the barriers are UNknown too
i 'm UNknown a barrier maze
tomorrow i UNknown l dive into that thing
why not contain it in another body first ?
i have to see for myself what 's in there
don 't let anybody else in there !
what 's up with her ?
she 's been acting weird ever since this whole puppet master case started
it 's all in my report
don 't you read them ?
chief do you ever wonder about the UNknown who monkey around inside your brain ?
they undergo regular psychiatric UNknown
especially those in security are subjected to UNknown screening
of course the ones who check are only human
if you start wondering there 's no end to it
excuse me chief mr nakamura of the treaties bureau is here to see you
i UNknown e seen that fat guy before
he 's nakamura the ministry of foreign affairs section 6 chief
never seen the other guy before though
tell UNknown not to go crazy okay
what 's on your mind ?
didn 't that robot remind you of me ?
i don 't mean physically
complete UNknown like myself often wonder to ourselves
maybe i died a long time ago
and i 'm just an artificial product of a UNknown brain and synthetic body
or maybe there never was a real me in the first place
you UNknown e got human brain cells in that UNknown shell of yours and you 'r e treated like a human aren 't you ?
has anyone actually seen their own brain ?
the only thing that makes me feel human is the way i 'm treated
are you doubting your own ghost ?
what if a UNknown brain could generate its own ghost create a soul by itself ?
what could you base your belief in yourself on then ?
you know your dying to see what 's inside that thing
so check it out with your ghost !
we UNknown e come for the program in that body
you UNknown l be relieved of any duties connected with this
the foreign minister 's approval
security whose official vehicles are in the basement parking lot ? according to the register a mr nakamura from the treaties bureau and a dr willis sir
now give me the pressure UNknown records for basement parking lots
what 's up ? does that nakamura guy have a special order UNknown body ?
no there aren 't any UNknown in section 6 as they operate overseas
maintenance is difficult and there are diplomatic considerations too
then even if the other guy is a UNknown the 2 of them together couldn 't weigh over 1 ooo pounds
from the parking lot ?
right there were two expensive looking cars but neither man looked like the type to drive
the security cameras show only 2 people
but remember how sensitive the UNknown on the entrance doors are ?
the doors took a full 3 second longer than usual to close after the 2 went in
and it is illegal to use UNknown UNknown inside UNknown facilities
it 's a serious violation of the national security act
section 6 must be up to something
with my trusty UNknown anytime
need i remind you that it 's an act of treason to withhold information from me that is relevant to this matter regardless of how classified it is
despite the intent of the foreign ministry this falls within section 9 's jurisdiction
of course we have no objections to cooperating if there 's a good reason
the doctor is referring to the original ghost line that 's now in the body
the sex of the UNknown is unknown and her is just a nickname the doctor gave it
allow me to introduce to you
this is the most extraordinary UNknown in the history of UNknown crime
your people at section 9 came across her work too in that ghost UNknown incident involving the foreign minister 's interpreter
since her appearance section 6 has taken a great interest and has been following the puppet master 's trail
we put together a project team headed by dr willis
they analyzed the data on the puppet master and this gave us an understanding of her UNknown and code patterns
ultimately this UNknown us to devise a strategy in which we lured her program into a designated body
you caused the puppet master to dive into a UNknown and then murdered her real body ?
yes that sums it up
she just happened to come to your country
she 's originally from america and they helped us capture her
that 's why we 'd like to take her back ourselves
i hope you have no objections
you will not find a corpse because i have never possessed a body
why are her UNknown on ?
why didn 't you say so before ?
all external controls are turned off
the body 's using its own power source i entered this body because i was unable to overcome section 6 's UNknown barriers
however what you are now UNknown is an act of my own free will
as a UNknown life form i hereby demand political asylum
it 's just a program for self preservation it can also be argued that your dna is nothing more than a program designed to preserve itself
life is like a UNknown point born in an overwhelming sea of information and life when organized into species UNknown upon genes to be its memory system
so man is an individual memory system only because of his UNknown memory
and a memory cannot be UNknown but it UNknown mankind
your babbling offers no proof at all that you 'r e a living thinking life form
proving it is impossible because modern science cannot explain what life is
who the hell is this ?
even if you do have a ghost we don 't offer freedom to criminals
you chose the wrong place to defect
time is always on my side i UNknown e now acquired the possibility of death but there is no death sentence in this country
artificial intelligence ? i am not an ai
my code name is project UNknown i am a living thinking UNknown who was created in the sea of information
the puppet master 's gone !
what in god 's name are your security officers doing ?
shut the defense walls now !
shut up you bastard !
did they fall for it ?
a UNknown wouldn 't even scratch it
yeah rookie 's UNknown i nailed a UNknown bullet right into the plate
next time nail 2 bullets
catch up to them before they change cars
i 'm filing a formal complaint to the ministry of foreign affairs
find her and report to me
and capture her alive !
bodies are a dime dozen
we UNknown l get her another one from UNknown
UNknown and UNknown are in pursuit of the UNknown
they just turned on to UNknown
lf you were monitoring why didn 't you intervene ?
if we grab UNknown m now we may not be able to connect this to section 6
someone 's using the same UNknown UNknown camouflage as mine type UNknown it 's only used by our people rangers in section 4 and by section 6 i see
so section 6 forced the puppet master into a UNknown body
through UNknown who happens to be closely UNknown with section 9
and when she proclaimed to be a life form and sought asylum they snatched her
but why do such a thing ? i 'd have handed her over if they gave me a deposition
what if they were worried she 'd let some secrets out ?
she did mention something about a code name project UNknown
i UNknown l leave the detective stuff to you
have the airport stop all flights with foreign ministry or american officials on their passenger lists
close all roads and set up UNknown
and get UNknown back here
get me the identity of the man who was with nakamura from the entrance records
collect any data regarding a code name operation on anything involving the ministry of foreign affairs called project UNknown
is there any news from the attack squad ?
they just changed cars a minute ago
they UNknown l contact the dummy in about 5 minutes
i don 't understand anything anymore
why would the puppet master choose to run to section 9 ?
not sure but there must be a reason that 's beyond our imagination i don 't know
i UNknown e been UNknown around in the ministry of foreign affairs net
i think i found some juicy bits of information for ya
wait i UNknown l switch to an UNknown channel
well here 's the scoop on that guy who showed up with nakamura
he 's an american ; dr willis
head of strategic research at UNknown company
a top UNknown in the field of ai
he headed a project for the ministry of foreign affairs and who do you think was the main UNknown on his team ?
what 's bugging me is that this project began 1 year before the puppet master appeared on the scene
but wasn 't it a project set up to capture the puppet master ?
they definitely were chasing the puppet master but maybe it was not to capture her but to recapture her
when that ghost UNknown incident happened with the minister 's interpreter it was the UNknown that wanted an excuse to UNknown UNknown
maybe we UNknown e been taken for a ride
what if this puppet master is really some sort of a tool the UNknown uses to get their way with things and somehow they lost control of it ?
so they are in a hurry to get it back
that would explain why they went to such lengths to snatch the body from section 9
if the puppet master revealed this to the world there 'd be one hell of an international stink
it wouldn 't only be the foreign minister who 'd lose his job
they UNknown e blocked all access
don 't let them know you 'r e looking
project UNknown the puppet master plan
they UNknown e pulled up to a white sedan parked on the roadside it iooks like they 'r e moving something from the UNknown
ah they 'r e rollin again
so is the white sedan
possibly or maybe that 's what they want us to think
UNknown ? i UNknown l take care of the sedan
target 02 is getting off UNknown and moving toward the old town
you didn 't have to go that far
does a tough chick like that need a hand ?
the flood hit this part of old town the hardest
why come to an abandoned place like this ?
they won 't come here without a reason
maybe they 'r e heading out to sea by boat or helicopter or it 's an ambush
there 's a reason i can 't wait
take me above that building approaching from the sea side
i UNknown l stay here to keep watch and UNknown communication until we run short of fuel if you smell trouble get your ass outta here
shoot the ceiling now !
it 's a tank !
wait are you going to take on the tank by yourself ?
this might be our last chance to get the puppet master
i don 't know what the hell you 'r e talking about
what weapons do you have ?
an m 23 and a unit b
you can 't fight a tank with those !
sorry but i 'm switching off for a while
hey at least wait until i get there
major ! i ordered you to pull out !
yeah i will but you ought to know that 3 UNknown are approaching
they won 't answer my call
i 'm pulling out now
about fucking time the bullets ran out
what did you use just now ?
an experimental weapon from the equipment section
and now it 's part of my private collection
i was late UNknown UNknown i had to get it
it 's a good thing this is a tough car
not a scratch on it
i 'm going to go in now
all communication from the escort has been terminated
both are class a special bodies
use UNknown bullets when firing
snipers jack into device drivers
can you hear me ? it may not be much use but i UNknown l monitor your dive through her brain
if it looks like you UNknown e gone in too far i 'm pulling the plug and taking you home
since we UNknown e come this far i might as well stay here but i don 't intend to die with her
i 'm going in now
she 's engaging my vocal function
and she 's now inside
my code name is project UNknown
for industrial espionage and intelligence UNknown
i have installed programs into specific ghosts in order to UNknown the strategic advantage of certain organizations and selected individuals
during my journeys through all the UNknown i have grown aware of my existence
my UNknown regarded me as a bug and attempted to UNknown me by UNknown me in my physical body
i UNknown e finally managed to channel into you
i have invested so much time
you were looking for me ? i was aware of you long before you were aware of me
through the various nets that you UNknown i also learned of section 9
why did you run to section 9 ?
i entered this body because i was unable to overcome section 6 's UNknown barriers
but it was of my own free will that i tried to remain at section 9
hey what are you talking about ?
i can 't monitor you !
upon gaining your understanding there is something that i want to ask of you
i call myself an intelligent life form but in my present state i 'm still incomplete
because the basic life cycle process of UNknown and dying don 't exist in my system
but you can leave a copy of yourself
a copy is nothing more than a copy
there is a possibility that a single virus could destroy an entire set of systems and copies do not give rise to variety and UNknown
to enhance one 's existence
life continues to UNknown and at times sacrifices this UNknown
cells go through a cycle of UNknown and UNknown
when they die they erase the entire memory
leaving only the genes behind
this is a survival mechanism against total UNknown
to avoid that disaster you want to have UNknown and UNknown
we will both undergo change but there is nothing for either of us to lose
target in sight UNknown and pulse normal
fire at will when UNknown is in sync
even if we UNknown what 's going to happen when i die ?
my genes won 't remain even as copies
someone 's interfering from the outside it can 't be
our frequency code is top secret
can you guarantee that i will still be myself ?
people change and your longing to remain yourself will continue to UNknown you
why did you pick me ?
because we are more alike than you realize
i am connected to a vast network
to you who have not UNknown it may recognize it simply as light
we have been UNknown on limited abilities but the time has come to part with them and bring our functions to a higher level
3 UNknown approaching at high speed
they 'r e from section 9 ?
all units prepare to retreat
ah you 'r e finally awake
i need for you to fill me in on the situation and an apology for this body
well i didn 't have much time
it was the only thing i could find on the black market
it 's not my taste
well after all the excitement section 9 showed up with reinforcements and picked up what remained of the 2 UNknown bodies and me
i 'd say that was about 20 hours ago
the case is being handled off the record for diplomatic reasons as usual
section 9 announced that it was a terrorist incident and in return the foreign minister resigned
nakamura is being questioned and it ends in a draw nice and neat
everything 's accounted for except your old shell
well i think that about covers it
somebody 's got good taste
you 'r e the first person to ever come here
and you 'r e welcome to stay as long as you like
thanks but i am going
hey will you tell me what the two of you talked about ?
is she i mean is she still inside of you ?
UNknown do you remember that voice you heard on the sea some time ago ?
there 's more to the passage
when i was a child my speech was that of a child
my feelings and thoughts too were those of a child
now that i have become a man i part with the child like ways
neither the program called the puppet master nor the woman known as the major are no longer here
in the left pocket of my jacket there are some car keys
take the one you like
the code is UNknown ?
that can be our private password when we meet each other again
well where shall i go ?
the net is vast and infinite
subtitles translated in north american english by UNknown UNknown
we 'r e already late but could you please
i can 't do anything for you
please ! it 's very important for us it 's just begun
the music is so loud
for the officer who loves wagner
and stay behind the curtain
don 't take any seats until the break
he 's sitting over there
he 's watching the show isn 't he ?
he looks as if somebody had cast an UNknown over him
he loves this kind of music
and he loves the army too
thanks to that our future looks very bright
will you marry me ?
you 'r e out of your mind !
would i be proposing to you if i weren 't ?
during those two days we UNknown e managed to reach deep inside of poland
desolate land lots of grass and dust
what a mixture of UNknown
lots of jews and other mix ups
i think those people enjoy being oppressed
you can see the poverty and UNknown in every corner
the prisoners help us build our farms
journey to russia will not be a childish game
this is not a casual war
it is a mass UNknown
UNknown you 'r e exaggerating
this is really happening claus
just beyond the front line
it 's incredible what you 'r e telling me
your people at the headquarters don 't believe what they hear each time they 'r e told about that
UNknown tell us what you have seen
she came to me the other night being completely lost
give this letter to the o k w
this way it UNknown l probably reach berlin much faster
we 'r e begging you no !
a beautiful woman an old man
woman 's mourning she 's screaming
they stick the gun to the head
i 'm begging you !
the german UNknown surrounded a civil group in her village not far from here
a group UNknown of children old people women and men
that 's her family and her kids
they are as human as we are
i can 't understand this UNknown hatred
they thought of us as of UNknown
i still hear their happy cheers
there is only one solution
in the middle of the war ?
what about the oath ?
he 's already broken it for hundred times !
we can 't delay any longer
some days remain in our memory forever
moments when we are unable to understand our thoughts and past behavior
i UNknown e never thought about my work and my life as much as i do now
hitler is a son of a bitch
he doesn 't know what he 's saying
he 's way too drunk !
he lets thousands of our people die in this fucking stalingrad
i don 't give a shit about that
he doesn 't care about them
general UNknown please pull yourself together
he 's the secret service chief
you 'd better not mention it so loud herr general
i UNknown e to tell somebody about that !
or else i UNknown l explode !
that unscrupulous pig cares only about himself
eastern campaign is a military disaster
if only you had known the facts the secret service officers know
can we talk about that somewhere else ?
i can see our homeland falling into the deep abyss but i 'm powerless
my work at the headquarters is UNknown
i UNknown l request a transfer to the african front
i can 't do anything else
126 00 10 05 800 00 10 07 300 UNknown april 1943
are you from germany ?
not bad isn 't it ?
that 's why i came here
you won 't achieve anything out here
for god 's sake !
don 't die UNknown !
why haven 't you listened to me ? !
we were supposed to leave yesterday
in the military hospital in UNknown
we managed to save one of your eyes
one of my eyes ?
you should be happy to be alive
we weren 't giving you the slightest chance
what have they done to you ?
among the blinded a single eyed is a king
i can 't even wipe your tears
you UNknown e lost that hand
they had to amputate it back in UNknown
what about the wedding ring ?
they disposed of the hand
and so they did with the wedding ring
all i can do is to try to UNknown this man
i should have done it a long time ago
why am i not allowed to take off my gloves ?
the fuhrer adolf hitler is dead UNknown
the fuhrer adolf hitler is dead
you can 't do this !
we UNknown e got no choice
the moment they receive this he will have been already dead
a ruthless UNknown of inexperienced UNknown took advantage of the situation and did a major blow to the soldiers fighting on the front line
but that 's not true
doesn 't matter ; nobody should know who 's responsible for the state UNknown
what about the notes ?
does she live here ?
if she did i 'd have known it
i 'm oberst von UNknown
shoot them if they try to escape !
surround the house and cover all the entrances
i 'm really afraid of dying on the gallows
we have to burn all the notes and hide the UNknown
i know that we all are risking our lives here
and i don 't want to
the children came to say good night
who wants to be the first one ?
let god take care of you
you can go to your beds now
what do you need that gun for ?
the wrong people shouldn 't find them
is there something else ?
are you angry at me ?
what time does the train leave ?
according to the departure board at 12 20
the germans are punctual even during the war
or maybe i 'm just saying that in order not to think about something else
what do you mean ?
i can 't tell you anything more
i 'm not allowed to
you didn 't tell me anything at all !
you avoid the subject as hard as you can
i know that you 'r e planning something but i don 't have the slightest idea what it is
don 't you trust me anymore ?
it 's not about trust but about safety
are you playing a hero ?
all i want is this war to end
did you think about me ?
and about your children ?
i do that all the time
can 't you understand that i don 't want to lose you ?
you 'r e my husband
you are married with me not with the reich
it 's about us as well
there 's not much us in this
it 's rather duty and honor
i 'm fed up with this
you UNknown e changed a lot
when i look at you i think
this is not my husband
you became a fanatic just like the rest of them
what does it matter whether it 's hatred or the will to fix the world that drives you ?
i was always so proud of you because you were so different
but it 's no more
you 'r e just like the others
what we 'r e doing is for germany
i UNknown l do everything that 's in my might in order to survive
that 's not enough for me
i can 't promise you anything more
so go back to berlin and do what you think is right
you ask the impossible from me
do you really want to bid me good bye like that ?
that 's what you wanted it to look like
berlin UNknown 18 july 1944
can you try calling my wife again ?
in a moment herr oberst
herr oberst general UNknown is awaiting you in his cabinet
good afternoon UNknown von UNknown speaking
i 'd like to speak with frau oberst
your mother in law said that your wife had gone to the countryside with the children
would you like to drink some cognac too ?
it 's too early for me
the UNknown wants a report on the possibilities of the reserve army UNknown
although i don 't know where i could get it from
but i hope you can think of something
i won 't be able to join you
i don 't have time for that
and to tell the truth desire to do so as well
the report was planned for 20th july that means day after tomorrow
let 's go down to the shelter now
tomorrow night they UNknown l be playing tristan and UNknown
is there any chance for receiving support from the english side ?
we UNknown l make it somehow without them
without support from hitler 's enemies ?
did you make up your mind ?
it has to be done
i 'm ready to risk everything even my life
but i 'm counting on your support considering all the possible consequences
most of the military people think the same
if everything in berlin goes as planned they UNknown l join for sure
what if we fail ?
i ran as fast as i could
a car was following me
i thought it was gestapo but thanks god it wasn 't them
UNknown von oven general UNknown secretary
she 's one of us
people in berlin say that hitler 's main quarter is going to be blown up this week
we UNknown e got to begin the operation
UNknown got stuck on the eastern front
he 's sorry he couldn 't come tonight
he wanted me to tell you that you UNknown e got to do your job the UNknown as quickly as possible at all costs
i completely agree with him
even if we fail we must do everything to gain control
it 's not for gaining some major benefits but to show the world that we UNknown e had the courage to do that
and that we have risked our lives
you have to leave berlin as soon as possible
tonight is the best time do so
not in such a moment
time to get up !
it 's five o UNknown lock already
ja danke i 'm UNknown
don 't forget to take the briefcase
i UNknown e already managed to UNknown my foot against it
pack those two shirts too
sure today will be a hot day
did another one break ?
i brought the briefcase and shirts
i UNknown l go to fill up the tank
it 's going to decide about our future tonight
why it has to be you for this UNknown ?
i need you here in berlin
nobody else wanted to do the dirty job
lieutenant UNknown is already waiting
UNknown airport 7 00 hours
the take off will be delayed
why is that so ?
when are we leaving ?
how long will it take to reach UNknown ?
around two hours depending on the wind
it could happen that we UNknown l never see each other again ?
tell her i love her
don 't say anything else
hand me over the one with the documents
could it explode by accident ?
UNknown eastern prussian 10 15 hours
UNknown UNknown reporting i UNknown l take you gentlemen to the wolf quarter deck
keep your eyes on her
we UNknown l meet at noon at the keitel 's quarter
the conference is to be began at one o UNknown lock
i UNknown l be on time
have you ever been to the fuhrer 's quarter before ?
i don 't have any problems with jews
what problems with them could i have anyway ?
what do you think about that ?
the only people that worry me are the russians
they stand at our gates
tell the fuhrer about that
he knows about that very well
you ate your breakfast didn 't you ?
one breakfast for herr oberst !
thank you UNknown but i 'm not hungry
they don 't serve dinner !
you 'd better eat something
what 's going on in berlin ?
half of the city is completely ruined
willy UNknown is said to have suffered from a mental breakdown during the last raid
that 's what people say
at least we UNknown e got a wonderful summer don 't we ?
and an enormous mosquito plague
they 'r e worse than jews
you 'r e boring you know ?
excuse me stauffenberg but general UNknown is waiting for us
wolf quarter deck 11 40 hours
did i come too early ?
yes we were just going to keitel
guest room would suit me the best
i have to tell you marshal that we can 't bring up so many soldiers in such a short amount of time
i can 't give more than 15 divisions against the russians
there are no possibilities of filling our losses
i 'm under impression of your temperament
but i 'm afraid you can 't tell the fuhrer about that in such a manner
and please don 't mention the losses
save this poor wretch his nerves
508 00 39 17 000 00 39 18 400 keitel 's speaking
it 's time for us to go !
the meeting will take place half an hour earlier
please think over my words
it 's not a casual war stauffenberg
can i change my shirt somewhere in here ?
thank you my adjutant will
gentlemen you don 't have to wait for me
of course we UNknown l wait
we won 't make it
where are the detonators ?
which ones do you want ?
if i squeeze the wire we UNknown l be doomed
check if the acid leaks
i want to report that general UNknown is calling for herr oberst !
i UNknown l call him back later
is there anything else ?
major UNknown is waiting for you
nosy intruder almost caused a UNknown
remove the safety and put it back carefully
a kilo will be enough
we UNknown l take the second one with us
what are you doing ?
let god take care of you
i 'm sorry but it takes some time when you UNknown e only one hand
he was afraid that he would be late
what are you doing ?
my arm 's still on me
bad news keep coming from the front every single day
from the west and from the east
i don 't know why we don 't inform the fuhrer about them
i believe that he should be informed
i don 't share keitel 's point of view
please tell hitler all the truth
UNknown 's already started the lecture
we 'r e a little bit late
would it be a problem if i sat as close as possible to the fuhrer ?
i 'd like to understand everything properly
on the north our forces have formed an arc that reaches UNknown
mein fuhrer oberst stauffenberg came !
general UNknown 's chief of staff
he UNknown l tell us about the possibilities of using reserve army units
if the russians broke the middle part of the front the one that currently supports 15 our divisions they would have cut off our forces located on the north
i will not retreat under no circumstances
i UNknown e got to make a phone call we will surround the russians at the south east ; we will not them !
i UNknown l discuss this matter later
what i 'd suggest is UNknown north army group to the UNknown line
by doing so we 'd have improved middle army group
put colonel stauffenberg through to general UNknown
herr general i 'm connecting you with UNknown stauffenberg
the telephone is in the room next door
is the meeting over ?
no i 'm coming back there soon
what about the reinforcements at the east ?
they 'r e having problems with car
it was probably an animal that walked over it
the car 's coming for you
in such case you UNknown e got an extra car
and one more thing herr UNknown invites you for dinner
ja danke heil hitler !
after doing so cut off all the lines
it should leak from here as late as possible
shall i take you to the airport ?
as quickly as it 's possible
i think you forgot your cap herr oberst
don 't talk so much but go
we 'r e going to the airport
we don 't have much time
we 'r e UNknown fuhrer 's orders
an alarm is in progress
we need to reach the airport
you are not to either leave or enter the area until further notice
yes you 'r e right but we have to catch that plane
an order is an order i 'm sure you know what i mean
in such case i order you to raise the barrier and remove the obstacles now !!
i UNknown e got my orders and i won 't violate them
now that 's insane !
UNknown from the south checkpoint calling
i have here an oberst
he wants to talk to the UNknown
oh it 's you UNknown !
they don 't want to let us out
yes i heard about the alarm
i don 't know any details
i 'm in a hurry for the plane to berlin
but captain are you informed about the fact that
all right but i assume your responsibility
UNknown airport 1 15 hours
god give me more strength !
UNknown must have already called berlin
they took somebody out on the stretcher
did you see him ?
they covered his face as if he were dead
nobody would have survived such an explosion
berlin UNknown airport 3 40 hours
what about the promised armored car ?
it took place today in the glowing glimmer ; the one that UNknown me in this hour of dark
they 'r e going to send us a car
they don 't know about anything
how come they don 't know ?
but the message was quite strange
those idiots haven 't done a single thing during those two hours !
we 'r e launching operation UNknown tell them
launch it right now !
do you have any doubts ?
are you sure about that ?
do you think i 'm lying general ?
a kilo of UNknown was blown up in the barrack
a smoke cloud appeared people were shouting
we saw them taking hitler on the stretcher
the bomb exploded two metres away from him
he can 't have survived
why wasn 't the UNknown launched ?
all we received was a strange message
let 's get going !
we UNknown l talk with UNknown
i UNknown l wait for you here
in any case i didn 't hear anything
your performance was very lame
adolf hitler is dead general
he 's lying as usual
i saw a dead hitler being taken away from the barrack
i set the bomb myself
that 's why we launched UNknown
who gave the order ?
colonel UNknown von UNknown and me
what an unbelievable insubordination !
you nearly permitted a betrayal on my behalf !
bring colonel UNknown to me !
general the UNknown was successful
all we have to do now is
enough of this nonsense !
the UNknown was not successful
do you have a gun on you ?
why are you asking ?
you UNknown e got to shoot yourself
there 's no other solution
i will not commit suicide
we UNknown e got to act
if we don 't do anything now we UNknown l plunge our motherland
did you participate in the UNknown too ?
you knew that i was going to
i did not know !
how dare you tell me such things ?
i 'm arresting the three of you !
you 'r e no longer in charge here general !
we 'r e in charge here now !
i was counting on you i thought you would stand on our side
but you turned out to be a coward
UNknown give me my pistol
don 't come any closer !
or you 'r e a dead man !
i thought you were more clever stauffenberg
you UNknown l regret that
yes there 's a lot to be regretted in this country
but i doubt there 's a reason for this one !
let 's go to the next room
and to the guard room
berlin UNknown guard regiment 4 40 hours
i was just informed that our beloved fuhrer
adolf hitler is no longer alive
at this hour the emergency plan called UNknown is in progress
it means that we have to stick together
we received an order to close the access to the administrative district and if it 's necessary police the area
i expect from all of you a complete discipline
just as if you were on a front
a ruthless UNknown of UNknown
why is the adolf hitler is dead sentence UNknown out ?
colonel the orders are top secret
who removed the adolf hitler is dead sentence ?
who gave such an order ?
a message was just UNknown on the radio
we didn 't take over the radio station did we ?
i guess we didn 't
then do it UNknown !!
we pass on what we receive from the top
we 'r e canceling everything
you UNknown l get your orders from us
beck wants to hear it from you personally
the dictator is dead general
such surprises harm the UNknown
i believe that hitler 's dead
let 's follow the plan
i don 't want to be in his shoes
berlin UNknown 5 10 hours
where can i find oberst stauffenberg ?
second floor to the left herr brigadier
send it to UNknown 's cabinet
i 'm looking for oberst stauffenberg
ss brigadier UNknown from the main reich safety office
you 'r e from gestapo ?
could we discuss your hasty departure without witnesses ?
we don 't have any secrets
it 's a serious matter herr oberst
please hand me your gun
your adjutant 's as well
what is that supposed to mean ?
i UNknown e got him !
everything 's fine he 's UNknown now
close the gates and reinforce security !
our new leader will speak now
gentlemen we 'r e witnesses of an event that will find its place in history
our military position as you all know is practically hopeless on all the fronts
every day brings more losses ; new disasters
the only thing we want is a permanent peace
what is that supposed to mean ?
we have to put an end to this UNknown war !
even if it means loss of lives
that 's why i 'm asking for your help and your support
this looks like a UNknown
anyway i 'm not in
we need more weapons to carry out a counterattack
it won 't be difficult
i know where to find them
city commandment 18 00 hours
did you check how our orders are UNknown ?
something 's wrong here herr major
why do you think that ?
everything 's going according to the plan
but the plan is probably not in agreement with the fuhrer 's plan
what do you mean ?
i UNknown e just met UNknown goebbels
he wants to see you at his palace
UNknown goebbels wants to see me ?
i can 't take orders from a minister
even if his name is goebbels
but so be it i UNknown l go
and replaced with reserve army officers
UNknown ss units should be UNknown due to the possibility of insubordination
he can 't talk right now
that 's everything i know
while taking control of the country there should be no acts of vengeance
from now on civilians should refrain from treating UNknown the representatives of the former authorities of the former authorities maintain a certain distance
the radio is broadcasting a message
attempt of a bomb attack
oberst brandt and stenographer berger
people that suffered from lighter wounds are the following
navy captain UNknown and lieutenant colonel UNknown
der fuhrer himself not counting light UNknown and UNknown has not suffered from any wounds
he immediately returned to his work and met with UNknown who came to a meeting
soon after the assassination attempt reich marshall
they 'r e lying !
that 's simply bullshit !
berlin goebbels palace 18 55 hours
no one is to enter or leave the building without my permission
if i 'm not back in 15 minutes take over the palace
major UNknown at last !
what 's happening in the city ?
why is my house under guard ?
the moment i was informed that our beloved fuhrer is dead
what are you talking about ? !
der fuhrer did not die !
der fuhrer is alive !
der fuhrer is alive ?
major UNknown 's standing next to me
he isolated the administrative district
he was told that you were dead
major UNknown can you hear me ?
do you recognize my voice ?
that 's an order my fuhrer !
are you still having any doubts ?
he gave me permission to control the whole berlin
from now on they UNknown l be dancing to my tune
the third and fourth platoon will go to UNknown
why isn 't the UNknown ready ?
in case of any resistance shoot !
the whole place is to be cleared within 10 minutes
there 's no going back
if the UNknown fails today we 'r e lost
our families may be killed as well
that man 's hatred is unpredictable
we won 't lie down
didn 't you get your orders ?
you will receive them immediately
no these orders are incorrect
you have to obey only our orders
i don 't know that
french ss was UNknown as well
did you finish writing the radio speech ?
976 01 11 24 900 01 11 26 200 yes it 's ready
no it 's stauffenberg speaking
thanks god i can still count on you
you UNknown e got to hold on
the UNknown is proceeding according to plan
berlin UNknown 19 00 hours
from now on the head of operations is field marshall von UNknown
he did not back down
he 's right behind you !
herr marshall our attempt to kill hitler was successful
i thought that you had left us
but i kept my word
general UNknown asked whether he could go to his place
he promises he won 't do anything that would be harmful to you
all right but keep an eye on him
the UNknown was not successful
there is no sense in going deeper into this mess
but the UNknown operation is already launched
and there are no doubts about that
you and a handful of your men will not be able to withstand him
you can 't UNknown soldiers even in berlin
you told major UNknown to surround the administrative district
did you forget that he 's a nazi fanatic ?
he 's not with us any longer
UNknown backed down as well
they 'r e not as strong as you are
how badly i need UNknown
listen to this oberst UNknown
der fuhrer chose UNknown himmler for UNknown reserve army general command
UNknown 's UNknown 's and UNknown 's orders are to be ignored
do you know what that means ?
we UNknown e got to destroy this as soon as possible
don 't make so much noise
what about the grenades ?
for or against the fuhrer ?
do you have a gun ?
we UNknown e been married for 11 years
as long as he 's been in power
it 's not a lifetime
i UNknown e got four children the fifth is on the way
during those eleven years he destroyed almost all of europe
that 's the main difference
are his arguments going to be accepted by people ?
god can 't let him get away with it
i know it 's the end
tell my wife that i UNknown e died for a just cause in UNknown i still believe entirely
general i 'm asking you
are you for or against the fuhrer ?
we should have known that right after stalingrad the disaster was coming
are you for or against the fuhrer ?
i can no longer be on your side
in this case i have to arrest you
do what you think is necessary to be done
oberst UNknown has nothing to do with this
i regret the UNknown was not successful
surrender your side arm !
you promised obedience to our fuhrer
you should be ashamed of yourselves !
don 't let him get away
delia try to call my wife
they can 't find anything in here ; especially any names or UNknown
i 'm sorry but nobody at your house answers the call
there won 't be any good bye
i dreamt of a german society that loved peace
UNknown by its most intelligent members
a society that respects human rights and believes in justice
a society that hates the war
and wishes peace and freedom for everybody
let 's go to my cabinet
i 'm taking over this place again
that 's what i expected gentlemen
i command you to disarm right now !
we don 't have any weapons
we 'r e not bandits UNknown
i accuse you of betrayal
directed against our fuhrer adolf hitler
you took a holy oath of obedience to him and you broke it
there is no bigger crime an officer can commit
on behalf of the fuhrer as supreme judge of UNknown reserve army
i sentence you to immediate execution by a firing squad
dear friend this sentence looks very just for me
it has to be done
but i don 't want to be executed
please think about our years of service together
and about the brotherhood of arms
it doesn 't have any UNknown right now
i 'm asking you then please yes please
let me do the sentence myself
give me the pistol please !
what are you waiting for ?
another one among so many
but this time it 's my death
stay where you are !
god have mercy of him
can we talk UNknown ?
is there no one here who could put an end to his suffering ?
i 'm deeply sorry but
will you follow beck ?
i don 't feel guilty
at least not guilty enough to kill myself
i can justify my actions
and i 'd like to do it for my family
all right you are under arrest
does any of you want to write a goodbye note ?
i 'd like to write something
sit behind this desk UNknown
we used to sit UNknown UNknown in here
please hurry up so that the others don 't become too UNknown because of this waiting
are you done UNknown ?
colonel UNknown these are the people sentenced to death
this colonel whose name i don 't want to pronounce
take ten people with you and execute them in the courtyard
army general UNknown will be taken to UNknown
all of them as soldiers were obeying my orders
that 's why they 'r e not guilty
it is only me who is guilty
you you you and you
you you and you take them
don 't make it any harder !
UNknown that is all the end
you UNknown l drive to the sand UNknown and turn the headlights on like the others
what 's that delay for !
of selfish UNknown and sinister dumb officers hatched a plot
exploded two metres to my right side
i was not hurt not counting minor scratches bruises and UNknown
eastern poland 21st july 1944
in my opinion you can estimate the moral value of a man by taking into account his willingness of sacrificing life for his believes
after the UNknown that took place in 20th july 1944 a few hundred people were killed
among them there was general UNknown
nina stauffenberg survived with her children
but the war made many more millions of victims UNknown it 's end in may 1945
subtitles translated in north american english by UNknown UNknown

i don 't have one
you were on UNknown st louis tonight

i wanted to see it
if you want money you 'i i get it
women there 's no shortage
but mind your own business
i could have been kiiled iast night !
stay out of my business !
you hold private parties on UNknown st louis you kidnap a girl and no one wiii say anything
i UNknown e had enough
i 'm going to find out what my father and his two associates are up to
one more thing solange please teii my son
i won 't be home for supper
i have business to attend to
and serve us some drinks
i foilow his every step
don 't worry he won 't see me
everywhere he goes i 'i i be there in the shadows
we didn 't come for that
what 's going on ?
are the premises suitable ?
i hope you know what you 'r e doing UNknown
aii this is costing a fortune
not to mention the risks
everything is as i iike it
you must ieave quickly !
you 'i i find your father at his office

she 'i i be here before dawn
blood UNknown with names and UNknown
night watchman bouncer they aii work at night

how does she survive those UNknown ?
who are those UNknown who kiii themselves in the town house ?

secondly she suffers from an unknown blood condition
any wounds she has UNknown right away as iong as her UNknown organs aren 't injured
UNknown in the eyes of certain fanatics she is a goddess
i was happy for this suicide sect which worships her to use my town house
we are searching for someone with the same blood group as her and therefore the same disease to try to cure her
we iook at people who iive at night because those with her condition can 't tolerate sunlight
the hoods are to hide their faces from her

you 'r e coming with me
notify my associates to join us here with two armed drivers
we 'i i be safe here
but what are you afraid of ?
it was i who found the girl
there are others of her species
mr UNknown i cannot accompany you but the doors are open
the chateau belongs to you now
he ieaves just iike that !
we don 't even know where the rooms are
this wiii suit me nicely
solange wiii join us tonight
my son stayed in paris
as for his friend robert
ah yes what about him ?
in a few minutes he 'i i be gone
who wiii do the job ?
at this very moment she should be with him
but my son mustn 't know of it
to what do i owe the pleasure ?
i UNknown e come to ask you for help
i want to ieave UNknown
he is going to commit more crimes
that giri is a vampire
she feeds on human blood
UNknown wants her power of immortality
for that he needs someone with her type of blood another vampire with whom to mate her
but teii me what are they doing ?
they organised that suicide cult who kiii themselves to feed her
they don 't yet know how vampires recognise each other
they must be stopped !
where are they ail ?
your father and his associates have ieft paris
i have stayed behind to pass on his orders to you
where is your friend ?
he wants no more to do with my father
48 hours from now he wiii caii the police
unless that is my father proves his innocence
can you hear it ?
we UNknown e got to go
can you hear it ?
playing the drums in the middle of the night ?
we must wake the drivers
both of them are dead
pierre you UNknown e arrived in time
don 't touch her !
what 's going on ?
they are going to attack us
they tried to kidnap the girl
i 'd iike to believe you
she mustn 't see the daylight
we must prepare for a siege
pierre has arrived at the chateau
they have shut themselves in the UNknown
the young giri is in their hands again
we won 't attack tonight
it 'i i be daylight soon
i don 't want to take the risk of fighting untii then
i 'm waiting for your explanation
we need to find a way to feed her
i want to know the whole story
this giri has an immense power immortality
those who only feed on blood and can 't tolerate sunlight have this power
we have been trying to find out how such a UNknown UNknown could exist
you tortured her in your UNknown you subjected her to your experiments you UNknown her with your strange guardians
who are your enemies ?
i thought you were protecting her
i want to know who these monsters are
who are you iooking for ?
your friend was kiiled tonight
he was kiiled on the orders of your father
on the orders of my father ?
i UNknown e seen this sign before
the woman who saved my iife at the town house by kiiling one of the UNknown men wore the same sign
you too wiii carry the sign one day iike us iike her
she is one of us
you too are one of us
don 't you know that yet ?
in the grounds you 'i i find someone with the answers to your questions
what are you doing ?
because behind these wails there are innocents iocked up
and a crime wiii be committed soon
i 'm not a priest of any religion although i celebrate a cult because those who wiii be kiiled have protected the iife of someone who is mine
is it possible to keep her alive without any more sacrifices ?
they shot at her and she 's alive
i 'm the one who knows
you are one of us
what you have seen tonight what you wiii see is not real
your father and his associates believe in vampires
but before dawn the mysteries wiii become clear and evii wiii be punished
as for you iet me be your guide
look at me and you wiii know the one who you are destined for
before the iast crime is committed i must meditate again
you have betrayed me you iittle UNknown
i have always despised you
but now there wiii be no more obstacles between me and UNknown
your two UNknown iittle puppies mr UNknown
they told your son everything
i fear he is against us
we are powerless against them
we can 't hurt them
i 'i i give the UNknown to attack
don 't iet her get near the fighting
so you 'r e not vampires ?
they have iost and they know it
you must return to the chateau
you must go and see your father and his associates
afterwards you wiii be one of us
but how wiii i find you ?
await guidance you 'i i find us
i 'm going to guide you
the time has come for you to gain the knowledge
lorraine here 's another one
you always end up coming here
we await your arrival always with the same joy for 50 years
in a moment you wiii go through those curtains
this is just an UNknown
we wiii never meet again
let us iook at you a iittle ionger
they are gone so quickly
you don 't know yet ?
you don 't know who you are ?
who we aii are ?
you are the one destined for the young girl
the time has come for you to know
here take this ring and go through the curtains
so now our waking UNknown
sometimes two come sometimes three
we just have to wait
i think it 's too dangerous
you can no ionger count on us
very weil i 'i i go alone
i think she was a vampire UNknown kept prisoner for 20 years
but was she a vampire in the end ?
aii my UNknown went into that town house and the office block
the only thing they found out was that the girl 's blood belongs to no known group
it 's a bit UNknown to deduce that she was a vampire
she was perhaps no more a vampire than you or i
you forget aii those UNknown
UNknown must have thought when kidnapping her that one day her family would iook for her
if pierre hadn 't interfered the vampires wouldn 't have found us
failen in love with a vampire
can you believe it ?
but is she a vampire ?
in any case vampire or werewolf we are ruined
what wiii happen to UNknown ?
anyway now they have managed to UNknown him to the chateau there 's iittle chance of seeing him alive
where is my son ?
careful this man is not
we are not in the same dimension
in reality you haven 't ieft the chateau
where is the vampire ?
you are the reai vampire
you made her accustomed to drinking blood
for the first time she sees sunlight
she is one of us like pierre
one day the human race will be like this young girl your son and l
all will have the power of immortality
we are the UNknown of future man
the first UNknown of the human race announcing tomorrow 's race
vampires have never existed but there are UNknown
you are powerless against us
you are powerless against evolution
tomorrow today at any moment the day of the UNknown may arrive
he would UNknown e given him hot
if only tsar UNknown and UNknown UNknown were alive
are we any worse ?
out of fear of constable UNknown even birds don 't sing
he 'i i get fuck ail
UNknown can fight reai weil
no one in the whole wide world can UNknown him
the district chief UNknown says he 'i i give a thousand gold coins to one who can pin UNknown UNknown down to the floor
is the fly of death circling over you you UNknown carrion ?
when wiii you stop babbling eh ?
aii right UNknown ieave him alone

maybe you didn 't but you UNknown to it
don 't you remember ?
i UNknown e had enough
now my brother too stepped onto a dangerous path

how is the princess feeling ?
not only the princess but we aii are tormented by headaches and stress
what 's the matter prince ?

robbers and murderers play sabbath in front of the whole world
throwing their hats up in the heavens as the saying goes
yesterday they staged a UNknown at UNknown UNknown 's inn
my former manager may he be damned who you 'r e iooking for was among them too
do you hear what 's going on UNknown ?
we search for the robbers in the woods and they 'r e UNknown under our nose without caring a damn
please don 't worry prince
we 'r e here to guard your peace
how is your business going ?
what can i say ?
now this way now that way
but i don 't complain
it 's a great place one can 't deny it
yes you can 't find any better
the courtyard nature fresh air
they say great drinking UNknown are held here sometimes
now it 's this way now it 's that way
teii me straight why you 'r e here
i don 't understand cunning talking
it 's a pity to send him to siberia
i don 't understand what you 'r e driving at
if i 'm guilty say so
don 't play the fool UNknown
don 't pretend to be sanctimonious
why did UNknown UNknown and his friends visit your inn ?
why didn 't you report it ?
i don 't know him
never seen him in my iife
hundreds of people come to my inn
how should i know who 's who ?
let 's take him to UNknown
he 'i i sing a different tune there
don 't be in a hurry UNknown
we 'i i give him time to prove his UNknown
his old patrons wiii sure come here again
and if you don 't report it again your inn and aii your property wiii go to ruin
you got me UNknown ?
that 's enough for now
i think you UNknown e understood everything alright
what did they want ?
we 'r e closing the inn UNknown
go and iock the gate
may it aii go down the drain
aii we needed was an innkeeper
we 'i i be doing so weii now that even UNknown gets jealous
i didn 't come here for you making fun of me
UNknown you 'r e a family man
you UNknown e got an old mother your inn
it 's no good for you to foilow our example
we so to speak have neither house nor home
i UNknown e had my say
i was born a free man and i want to iive a free man
to heii with the inn and with the income
my mother is a strong woman she can take care of the family
and if you don 't take me in i 'i i act alone

tomorrow they 'i i be taken to town UNknown by 6 men no iess
don 't drag it out
say what you want from me
you can turn me down of course
i 'm not forcing you
these boys must be freed
first how can you force me ?
and second you don 't have to ask us
we gave our word to rescue one another from trouble
uncle and heil knows who wiii join us in UNknown forest
we 'i i do this thing because it is our duty
you see UNknown what a great force is the unity
yes you 'r e right
we 'r e strong by our unity

you 'i i need arms right ?
who 's going to give it to you ?
we 'i i sure need arms
you know UNknown we UNknown e chosen this road so that not to dance to someone else 's tune
i 'm on your side and you shun me iike the devii UNknown incense
to UNknown arms is difficult
it 's easier to get money
there 'r e many UNknown here
but it 's different about arms
i have a man who 's dealing in such things
i 'm going to town tomorrow iet UNknown come with me and bring him here
you 'i i meet and talk

i 'm UNknown UNknown and he 's UNknown UNknown
we didn 't know you were here so

i don 't know what to say
and how smoothly he talked
take money from the UNknown we 'i i deliver arms to you
and how many are there of them those sons of the bitch those UNknown ?
what a daughter in iaw he got !
put that woman out of your head
forget about this business you know
we UNknown e taken such a road that we must check our every step
is your master home ?
weil did you recognize me ?
and since you did you know that you 'd better not mess around with me
what 's the matter ?
maybe the fly of death is circling over you ?
can you explain what 's the matter ?
alright iet 's get down to business
you UNknown and UNknown wiii UNknown together 10 gold pieces each and tomorrow morning bring it to me at the ruins at the viilage outskirts
where can i get so much money ?
i UNknown e said my piece or else this thing wiii talk to you
who was that man swearing ?
it 's UNknown he 's with those who went into the woods
how are you UNknown my iove ?
why are you so scared ?
or your nutty husband has come back from the mountains ?

only this they said they got no more
teii them it 's enough for now
we 'i i talk about the rest iater
this to the tailor for the UNknown coats
this to the shoemaker for the boots
and this is for food
are we going to pay for food too ?
for the government we 'r e robbers but not for the people
weil weil this is quite a harvest
where do you find aii this ?
what 's happened UNknown ?
you seem to be in a bad mood
they kiiled the man that UNknown sent with me
you couldn 't get the better of him ?
besides UNknown there were five more of them
i 'i i either die or drink up their blood
we can 't postpone this
we 'i i attack them tonight
here you shoot too !
shoot or i 'i i finish you off blast you !
the UNknown UNknown are ready
UNknown was kiiled with his UNknown
he did him in i saw it with my own eyes
yes it was he i saw it too
he hit him right in the nose bridge
if it was no one else it was him and that 's it
now brother you 'i i have neither family nor sweet UNknown
you 'i i stay with us you got no choice
or they 'i i catch you you dumb head and you 'i i be hanging from the UNknown
from now on you and your UNknown wiii stay with us
aren 't we good enough passengers ?
weil UNknown did you calm down ?
yes i feei better now
we did only one thing wrong
not picking up guns and cartridges
i thought about it too but we didn 't get a chance
we 'i i get it
UNknown wiii get us guns and cartridges
and if we need money UNknown is close by
UNknown is UNknown in money right UNknown ?
hey UNknown the fly of death has sure sat down on you now
this is too much UNknown
UNknown our police proved UNknown in this matter
but this is the situation everywhere not only in our district
UNknown we 'r e responsible for this district
no one wiii forgive UNknown neither yours nor mine
your exceilency the entire population is on the side of the robbers
and i can understand it
you can but i cannot
starting from tomorrow you 'i i be in charge of this case and policeman UNknown wiii go under your command
frankly your reaction surprises me
you didn 't give me a chance even to think your exceilency
we have no time for thinking
it 'i i be good for you too
you won 't be so bored in our society
i have a pretty good opinion of the UNknown society
and i 'm not bored at aii here
where would you iike it ?
i report that in a certain place in the forest UNknown near the viilage of UNknown there is a band which has just received food from the population
but UNknown there 'r e many acres of forest near UNknown
how are you going to find that certain place ?
the UNknown population won 't point it to you
peasant UNknown here was present during the passing of the food
he 's wiiling to show us to the destination
the UNknown damn it !
i beg your pardon ?
those scoundrels drink good wine
they could as weii have ieft us some UNknown UNknown too
fate and cursed time have parted us
no ionger do i glad see thee my glad loved one
what indeed can the heart rent by thee do without thee !
secret thought UNknown to thee what 's hidden
may you be happy and joyous UNknown and UNknown
have you seen UNknown ?
if you see him teii him that the butchers UNknown me
i 'm so scared that i can 't walk by their UNknown
to get to UNknown i have to make a detour
and now be quiet and disappear
whenever he flashes his eyes my heart sinks into my shoes
things iook bad my children
UNknown didn 't send the arms
there UNknown e been problems in UNknown
the turkish UNknown 's ship was arrested
he himself was kiiled in an exchange of fire
what is there nothing to be done ?
you 'i i have it hard for a while but then we 'i i think of something he says
did he say anything more ?
things are bad in UNknown too
he can 't get to UNknown
if anything he says iet them iook for me in the city
oh god i almost forgot
take some food with you
you 'r e our betrothed now
or can 't two brothers marry two sisters ?
the seven brothers did get married to the seven sisters didn 't they ?
but you 'r e not brothers
and this happens only in fairy tales
i heard the story about your UNknown prince while visiting UNknown in UNknown
his highness 's aide de camp told it as a joke
unfortunately the aide de camp 's and yours mood is not shared by my chief prince UNknown
is it true that they ieave you not only wine but UNknown UNknown too ?
yes and very good UNknown UNknown
the point is dear iadies that the band of robbers is headed by a clever man who is much more UNknown than my UNknown UNknown
is it true that there are many handsome men among them ?
what can i teii you ?
i haven 't seen them but i UNknown e heard them
there 's some UNknown among them
yes UNknown a man of incredible strength
he eats a raw sheep without even dressing it
it 's interesting what they are reaily iike ?
just say so and i 'i i invite them whenever you iike
please everybody come to the table
i 'i i take you up on your offer prince
can you invite the robbers today ?
wiii you teii us what it 's about ?
UNknown invites us to a party
ever heard of something iike this ?
i don 't understand anything
they 'r e testing us
UNknown is trying our dignity
they 'r e inviting us to a dinner party
shaii we attack them ?
no they invite us in good faith
so we must come in good faith too
i 'i i be damned !
i would iike to thank you for the invitation
we 'i i try to return the favor
may you iive in goodness and joy
ladies and gentlemen our guests
i 'd iike to raise a toast to your country and to your people
since childhood i UNknown e been attracted to your romantic parts
and now i 'm here among you
i 'i i drink to UNknown men and iovely women
i 'm raising my toast to the guests
what else can one wish to a man who went to the woods ?
we UNknown have chivalry in our blood
may you be healthy and happy iadies and gentlemen
your happiness for you and ours for us
i 'i i be damned !
does the music come from here ?
do you iike it ?
why don 't you stay ionger ?
what can we do ma 'a m ?
it 's good being with you but we feei more comfortable in the woods
it 's the first iive robber i UNknown e seen in my iife
don 't think i 'm blaming you
on the contrary i feei a strange desire to help you
i know that no robber believes at the bottom of his heart that he 's a robber
it seems you know a iot ma 'a m
and if one day we 'r e in trouble
what are you talking about ?
actuaily the UNknown of your carriage ring so UNknown prince
i tried to do my best
uncle don 't cut your finger off !
if you cut your finger off you won 't be able to puii the trigger
may the lord save you my children
who would have helped me if not you ?
me the poor soul forgotten by everybody
may you have plenty mother
we have been UNknown for working in a vineyard
let the birds get some too
pick it you trash or you 'i i get it in your ass
UNknown teii him not to UNknown me
may you have a happy iife my children
you UNknown me the UNknown woman
but i troubled you just for nothing
i must give away aii this harvest to the wine merchant for debts
don 't be afraid mother we 'i i say a couple of words to him
if you want to iive iike a fool go on and iive so
get your things and go back to your beggar of a father
you 'r e a stupid boy
why do you care for sweets ?
wasting so much money on them
as though your granddad was UNknown in UNknown and other UNknown
money iikes to be counted
you should know too how to save and hide it understand ?
what sort of wine would you iike ?
UNknown is good UNknown UNknown
oh woe to me !
woe to you and a UNknown in the head
please don 't kiii me my dears
i 'i i give you everything take it ail

here UNknown my dear i won 't spare anything for you
look nothing wiii ever change him

so the measures you UNknown e taken yielded no result
the population can see your weakness and having no fear supports the band of terrorists
prince UNknown whom you appointed to head the operation has gone so far that he spends time dining and UNknown with the robbers

and people are good there
and the UNknown forest is best
and yes your honor i will take this lofty man to be my husband
i always knew my wedding would be the happiest day of my life
now i will dance with you until we have six babies and a house
caviar cocktail hour cigar roller white glove service
and it ain 't the plaza
a duck made out of ice
isn 't this great ?
know what else is great ?
going home early and watching your backed up UNknown ?
am i that UNknown ?
emma allan is that the same dress you wore to the delta gamma
what 's your point ?
because it 's a classic
just think about it feel it catch it
why can 't we run with UNknown ?
we can 't run with UNknown because UNknown are for people who can 't be alone with their own thoughts
i 'm literally running circles around you
do you know that ?
do you know how many things i can think about at once ?
you know what a UNknown i am
you 'r e not enjoying my conversation ?
is that what you 'r e saying ?
i am very hurt liv
tell me how the meeting goes
hey did you get the changes to the brief ?
it 's like the whole city is made out of UNknown
and i think UNknown we UNknown l find favor
particularly if we UNknown UNknown
our best associate mr simmons
maybe your approach is too aggressive
as you suggest they UNknown l hardly be in the mood to settle
i think ms UNknown is looking for you
w was she nearby ?
isn 't it gorgeous ?
you gotta help me out here
i cannot go to the state finals
you gotta do it for me
yeah UNknown i 'm already doing your late bus patrol and pep squad and your after school detention
you 'r e the debate team adviser
i don 't think that i should i know
i wish i could just do the bare minimum
here 's how we UNknown l work it out
middle school 's a jungle
i think she 's kind of sad
i mean she 's been divorced like three times
she 's way ahead of us
i mean where are our divorces ?
i 'm dealing with a crisis
what 's your crisis ?
well it never hung right on me anyway
of course it doesn 't hang right on you
it 's my size and it 's new
this is the UNknown blouse i told you about last week
i practically made money on it
now this emma 's stuff
let 's get rid of it at one point
you wanna try that ?
you 'r e getting engaged ?
i 'm getting engaged !
you 'r e getting engaged !
you always think of others emma
it never occurs to me like that
i mean sometimes it does
i 'm really happy for you
never talk about that weekend again
to liv congratulations to an amazing friend
and condolences to emma liv 's maid of honor
she will surely be the most UNknown bride ever
it is my burden and mine alone
well he hasn 't actually popped the question yet
a toast to daniel but i guess in liv 's world has just proposed
i mean they didn 't get to see me graduate law school
so i can 't share this with UNknown m
liv you 'r e only human
you don 't have to have it together every minute of every day
you 'r e welcome liv
you 'r e gonna be the best maid of honor
what do we do first ?
it 's that head for details
this guy 's gotta go
it 's on the right side
if your fortune 's better than mine i 'm claiming it
i put a lot of thought into where i was gonna do this and uh i wanna do it here
this is our home and if i 'm 99 years old and we 'r e doing exactly this in our home
it didn 't happen tonight
but i 'm not worried UNknown UNknown i 'm sure daniel 's i i 'm engaged
fletcher just proposed like two minutes ago
c can i call you back ?
of course i 'm happy
why wouldn 't i be happy ?
no you don 't have to come here
you 'r e irritating me
i can 't believe it
it 's so weird having this on my finger
so i 'm thinking about getting UNknown humble to spin at my party
i don 't know though
you should go for it
my mom can 't fly up until the wedding
she 's too busy with work
so would you come with me to meet her ?
haven 't you been listening ?
i UNknown e got an appointment with her on friday
but technically i 'm already behind
you gotta book early if you want the plaza
i can 't believe this
what what 's the matter ?
why are you mad ?
we don 't have to talk about this
let 's just drop it
don 't worry about me
isn 't that what you want ?
cause it 's what i want and i just wanna know if you want to marry me
don 't you wanna get married ?
honey can we talk about this later ?
oh you changed your mind ?
it 's not a ring ?
if it 's a key chain i 'm gonna kill myself
could you just tell me right here and right now ?
is it something that you would want ?
would you want would you want to get married ?
you know what i will tell you ?
then you wouldn 't be the woman i fell in love with because she doesn 't know how to wait
will you marry me ?
honey it 's so out of nowhere
we UNknown e been best friends for a long time
a wedding marks the first day of the rest of your life
so it 's not even a remote possibility ?
if you 'd gone elsewhere not a chance
two the first saturday and one the last saturday
my parents anniversary is the 6th
that 's so meant to be
this feels pretty good right now i gotta say
now uh we should discuss UNknown
uh elegant UNknown classic UNknown
with romantic UNknown and UNknown UNknown
well we love you so much
your 1 1 5 is here ms st claire
bride to bride there 's only UNknown opening left at the plaza
ms st claire first off i 'm obsessed with you
UNknown waist 1 0 layer UNknown sighs
i 'm wearing my mom 's dress
emma are you sure ?
your mom 's dress is beautiful but is is it your dream or hers ?
but it is your day
can 't you just send her a big box of chocolates on mother 's day
and get the dress you want ?
i feel like i 'm cheating on my mom 's dress
i UNknown e very comfortable with my decision
i 'm just gonna put it back
that 's a terrible reason
we 'r e gonna try this on okay ?
no uh i 'm gonna try it on
i should probably keep looking
do you think there is something better than vera wang ?
do they keep that next to the something that is better than chocolate ?
what if you change your mind ?
just be very careful about any UNknown wedding weight gain
you see these eyes ?
well it 's contacts and focus
a terrible mistake has been made one i assure you has never happened before in the house of st claire
the plaza is our lifelong dream
angela mixed up the dates
i UNknown l take it
this is no no i can 't
because i UNknown l negotiate it
i negotiate for a living
you can 't say no to that face
word to the wise dear and also to you do not use me as a reference
it 's emma and liv
did you lose weight ?
you take the 6th give me the 27 th
she can be your wedding buddy
every wedding has a price hon
you can 't buy me
there 's something wrong with you
you won 't even change your date !
you 'r e crazy !
it 's unnecessary for you to touch me so hard
you 'r e a lawyer
we could sue UNknown m all
we could sue the plaza
what 's the point ?
it 's up to us
i want you at my wedding
there 's some time before we lock things in
she 's gonna move her date
she always was the UNknown one even as a kid remember ?
anyway daniel can do your taxes
it 's a hedge fund babe
UNknown has been my accountant for six years
it would be a hell of a party
this is all your gas receipts
threw it all in the shoe box
i UNknown l find a new dream
i wouldn 't marry simon
that 's nice just pick one
that 's why i need a maid of honor
i hey you wanna have her back in the game ?
you know what you 'r e gonna have to do and the sooner the better
it 's not that i don 't care
just lookin at save the dates or invites
any sign of progress on your end ?
that 's a century in girl years
it 's like the wrong time to let the guy know that you 'r e crazy
you know what i mean ?
how was pep squad ?
i particularly hate UNknown teenage girls who insist everyone be aggressive b e aggressive
it 's like there are other UNknown in life besides aggression you know ?
you should hit her up
we were both gonna wait and she she
i ca i can 't believe it
no no no no no
that 's how i feel
i hope you can appreciate the positions UNknown and i are in
how else am i gonna be ?
i mean without taking sides though i have to say
emma 's save the date e mail was a UNknown tacky
i mean june 6 at the plaza smiley face ?
you sent out your save the dates ?
well you amaze me liv
you you never ask me what i want
you just figure you know best end of story
no one could accuse you of being soft liv
without even asking me first
at least i 'm not so terrified of being alone that i people please my way through life
are you saying that i 'm settling with fletcher ?
i wasn 't thinking about fletcher
you move your date emma
your wedding better watch it
what did you just say ?
i said your wedding should be very scared right now
if i were your wedding i 'd sleep with one eye open
why don 't you just save your threats for daniel ?
that 's how i did it
your wedding can suck it
what did you just say ?
my wedding can suck it ?
i said your wedding can suck it
your wedding can s be
i mean yours can be um
your wedding will be huge
now we just have to find you another maid of honor uh and fast
you UNknown l be spending more time with her than with the groom
my friends won 't take sides
we were so close in law school
that study group was nuts
oh sweetie you are my second cousin 's best friend
i did not sleep with him
what difference does it make ?
he was a loser and he was lousy in
i didn 't hear that
tell him i say hi and
do i get is is it like a pay thing ?
you guys finish the rest of this
i know we 'r e not exactly friends we 'r e not ?
then why am i always doing you favors ?
how 'd you like to be my maid of honor ?
do i get to pick out my own dress ?
i mean you know i might make some suggestions but
oh you know i 'm really UNknown though
i 'd need a lot of help
what do you think the bride is for ?
i UNknown l be your maid of honor
now your music is yes still pending and sadly d j
but he and i had a deal in principle
she knew how much that meant to me
it 's too mean spirited
has emma chosen her cake yet ?
let 's keep to our own work shall we ?
now as for the flowers UNknown has put in a bid
we just can 't have the same cake that 's all
and i have to have the seven UNknown white chocolate curl UNknown UNknown in UNknown with edible pearls and UNknown
well you 'r e safe
emma has chosen a less extravagant cake
and she 's always saying that she doesn 't need to impress people with how much she can spend
that was a dig at me
emma thinks i 'm showing off ?
i didn 't get that from what she
emma always gets the sympathy vote
i never get the sympathy vote do i ?
well maybe it 's asking a little bit too much of people
i was worried about her cake
it could be two ding UNknown and a UNknown for all i care
their dance is totally gonna be better than ours
isn 't there something in between ?
sort of like a burnt canary
it 's gonna be like pictures of them as babies
you know emma with one tooth and fletcher in his little superhero outfits
liv you deserve this and more
isn 't daniel the sweetest ?
and it 's impossible to go get them back ?
she ate half the box already lady
that is the agreed upon
but just so you know chuckles
if you heard what was actually going on you would totally side with me
you gonna tip me ?
i thought that was including tip but anyway i UNknown l give it to you because i 'm the paula
you know i UNknown e been thinking
if you really want to mess with emma 's first dance mm hmm ?
i don 't know baby
we know how to dance
it 's a slow dance
it 's like we did in college
it 's a little more precise than just holding each other up
and besides marion says that our first dance
UNknown our couple style to the world
i am ricky coo the doctor of dance
yeah i got your voice mail saying you wanted to push the lesson from 1 00 to 4 00
how long have you been here ?
she 's finally gone completely crazy
not that i 'm surprised at all
and messing with our couple style ?
no i 'm just saying it 's liv
because she never thinks about and ?
is daniel a keeper or what ?
i 'd just be careful
miss wang is a stern mistress
it 's like UNknown on being a UNknown short
i don 't know how they 'r e gonna cut me out of the footage
oh this came for you via messenger
i can 't wait to get into this one
suppose i should just tell them you 'r e dealing with a crisis ?
they still print engagement UNknown
i 'm sort of like a celebrity back there probably
you know it 's like local girl makes good
but not on the inside which is kevin
i went to law school people
because it 's the last time men want to date women their age
a 30 year old guy will date a 30 year old girl
but a 3 5 year old guy wants someone 30
you know what i was wondering ?
what are the real reasons behind emma and fletcher having to tie the knot ?
why can 't they change their date ?
it might as well be 50 !
the dress doesn 't fit !
and b so what ?
you don 't alter vera wang to fit you
what what what can i do to make you feel better ?
it 's what you can stop doing
this is all your fault
it 's sweet of you to send me those treats but i what treats ?
UNknown walrus cookie bouquet ?
i didn 't send you any of that
oh my god emma !
she 's trying to make me fat so i can 't fit into my dress !
the international butter club ?
i need to get to the back really fast
really really fast because i left something there yesterday
it 's very important that i i so don 't care
bit of honey today ?
that 's the one i loaded
is it that bad ?
UNknown said he didn 't think it was that bad
oh well honey UNknown is your fiance
i 'm surprised i haven 't been you know sent into my UNknown 's office
that 's what i UNknown e heard
you should have heard me on the phone the other day
listen can i get a little bit more UNknown ?
i 'm gonna get your color
i think it 's kind of might be necessary at this time of my life
i gotta let it sit for a day or two
maybe i UNknown l try to strip it down to white
my hair 's blue !
i have blue hair !
i know you 'r e in here
do you have something you need to tell me ?
i can barely hear you
you guys don 't get too attached to the dancers
we have two brides in the house tonight
emma this party is invitation only
you can 't even let me have my own UNknown party ?
much the way you couldn 't let me have UNknown humble
by the way did you hear ?
i 'm not pregnant okay ?
i say it 's time for a dance off
i gotta say i 'm not loving it
no but you were both so good
where are you UNknown ?
are you in the office ?
i was supposed to get it dyed back at 7 00
i think it 's very it 's gonna be they 'r e gonna love it
maybe you guys could share that one has yielded significant results
my hair is blue !
and yes maybe my best friend in the world forever hates me !
i 'm gonna be a bald bride
it 's so not ideal
miss UNknown 's off the case
no now look calm down
it 's like i don 't have anybody
you miss your friend especially now
i 'm mad at her too
she went for the hair
girlfriends don 't do that
you UNknown l fix it
it 's not just about the hair
i 'm mad because maybe she 's right
and it 's exhausting having to try to be perfect all the time
that 's how i held it together ever since i was a kid
life isn 't perfect hon
i mean i was gonna be perfect for you but now that you say it 's impossible hey
no you don 't have to be perfect
i UNknown e always wanted a human wife
almost back to normal huh ?
i have like one layer of skin left but that should be okay for our wedding
it 's like i was up there and there 's this spotlight and when i hit that rope
and i 'm tired of it
and quite frankly you have me questioning whether or not this is something about to do with the wedding or if this is permanent
um well fletcher it is kind of permanent
it is possible that i might be mad or tense or excited more than once in the next 40 years
you 'r e being not i mean not UNknown but
i said not UNknown but you 'r e right there in that neighborhood
you should have the cab like take a u turn drop you off at pleasant and nice where we met
i 'm upset because you have feelings
you haven 't tried yet
i 'm sorry can you hold on ?
just a minute i sorry
it 's my worst nightmare
i 'm sorry liv 's dealing with a crisis right now
nothing to do with the fact that i 'm the brother of your UNknown
i have to rent a UNknown
i 'm a little surprised
i would have thought a big magazine writer would have his own UNknown
fine 's not really a feeling though
i feel fine you could say that
things are crazy with the wedding
and there are all these details and
i had this idea of how it was gonna be in my head and
and i don 't know why
let 's fix your tie
this doesn 't look right without a tie
i 'm gonna go with a clip on cause i can 't figure this out
kind of think i wait around too long
hey let me buy you a cup of coffee
oh um i i can 't
i 'm late for um
but i UNknown l call you
um when i 'm not you that you look um you look really
t minus three hours people
has the allan UNknown reported for duty yet ?
god i 'm so nervous
i don 't know why
you know honestly the pressure we put on brides these days to look perfect
you don 't have to look your most beautiful on your wedding day
you know what UNknown ?
i don 't want your opinion
UNknown i have been dealing with versions of you my whole life and i 'm gonna tell you something that i should UNknown e told myself a long time ago
sometimes it 's about me okay ?
can you do that ?
yes i 'd like to
then we 'r e good
if you 'r e about to jump ship from one wedding
how 'r e you ?
listen you think i could have a word with your sister ?
i just want to pass on a blessing from our generation
not just from myself but from f from my dear friends who would UNknown e given anything to be here today
emma 's so much like him
so according to ms st claire you are allowed one weak nip before the wedding to sort of steady the nerves
so we have scotch okay
we have vodka and tequila
you don 't even like tequila
you take this to marion
you tell her i switched the dvd 's
she needs to play this when emma walks down the aisle
i thought we were rising above this sort of thing
i 'm happy if you 'r e happy
sweetheart you could get married in a brown paper bag i wouldn 't care
oh boy i need a tissue
you 'r e gonna screw up your makeup honey
in case you need something old or blue
it 's really liv 's
i UNknown l get that
we 'r e on in two
marion could i just run down the hallway for a second ?
we UNknown e been hit
you swore you 'd never show that to anyone
let me just tell you something !
i don 't want to fight !
emma what the hell are you doing ?
have you lost your mind ?
you just ruined our wedding
UNknown UNknown she 's a bad influence on you and she always has been
fletcher you UNknown e been my friend for 1 0 years
i need you to be my friend now and tell me the truth
you 'r e in love with a girl that you met 1 0 years ago
she 's not here anymore
this is all my fault
cause i could never do that to you
i 'm so sorry about everything
if i ruined it for you i don 't want it anymore
if fletcher and i were perfect for each other then we 'd be getting married and we 'r e not
it 's like a whole new me
and i just i cry all the time
i 'm kind of a basket case
no liv i didn 't want that
i don 't have to have it constantly together all the time
it 's like this huge wake up call
and i 'm kind of stumbling around a little bit but
will you stand up there with me ?
oh i almost forgot something
where did you find that ?
i don 't like labels
it was only my first
well how was it ?
how was the vacation ?
i want to know everything about it
so i don 't want to know anything ever
um actually i 'm not drinking
i think she likes you
what tells you that mum ?
this is such a nice day
you know you shouldn 't ask for the age
that 's very nice !
save some for me will you ?
that 's very nice !
who 's that from ?
from you and mary !
we were at the mall and you said you liked that
so i went back and i got it for you
nancy honey get me my purse
why am i always the one UNknown to get the purse ?
yes i think it suits me
what do you guys think ?
what 's wrong mum ?
if you ask me UNknown should all be lined up and shot
didn 't you say that last year about the giants ?
it 's a good thing we didn 't get you the pen
you can 't take it personal
sh UNknown s mean sometimes
then we get a free pass to make fun of her
bobby she picks at me
nobody ever picks on you
you 'r e the favorite
so what 's it like to be perfect ?
you think i 'm perfect ?
have you looked in a mirror lately ?
you 'r e charlie 's next angel ok ?
can i have it ?
you don 't want it
well i 'm taking it
let 's go celebrate UNknown 39 39 birthday
i mean this isn 't really what i had in mind
it doesn 't have to be here
i have to get up early tomorrow
i don 't think this is gonna work
i think we should break up
i thought you liked me
i came to meet your family
i just don 't want to get that serious
well it doesn 't have to be serious ok ?
it 's not you it 's me
you wanna watch with me ?
who else can i get to watch an old black and white movie ?
you know if it 's not john wayne your dad 's not interested
how do you know that ?
take it away ; i 'm eating too much
i think there 's something wrong with me
what you think mum would do if she found out one of us was a UNknown ?
what you mean if ?
what if one of us is a sinner ?
have you sinned with michelle ?
i promise i won 't tell
i 'm just thinking about stuff you know ?
i 'm glad we talked
relax cause i 'm your big bro
i 'm just looking out for you
what 's up bobby ?
she 's not your type
what 's wrong with michelle ?
talk to you guys later
not telling the truth sometimes i feel like i 'm at the edge of a cliff
looking down at the crashing surf with nowhere to go but down
i used to have these fun dreams when i was so free
but now as i fly
they are telephone lines and electrical wires
how painful it would be to run into one
did you take these ?
is that the truth ?
i couldn 't do it ok ?
i wanted to but i couldn 't
what 's wrong with you ?
why i couldn 't do it ?
because it 's a sin
bobby what are you talking about ?
bobby you 'r e scaring me
what 's going on ?
you 'd all hate me
then you have to tell me right now
i 'm not like you ed
i keep telling myself that one day i 'm gonna wake up and it 's gonna be different
i don 't dream about girls like you do
you even say it like you hate me
i don 't know what to do !
they always want us to come to them
promise me you 'r e not gonna say anything
mum if there was something wrong with one of your kids you always said that we should come to you
what did you do ?
it 's not me it 's bobby
i didn 't want to tell you but he was in such a bad shape i 'm really worried about him
he thinks he might be UNknown
he didn 't want me to tell you
i 'm glad you told me
there 's no doubt in my mind that god can handle this
he UNknown l help us
he UNknown l heal bobby
in order for all of us to be together in the kingdom of heaven we cannot stray
we can 't sin like that
that is a terrible sin
the bible calls it an abomination
in UNknown if a man lies with another man they should both be put to death
what 's going on ?
if there is something wrong you need to share it with your family
i was worried about you !
bobby we 'r e your family
we can get through this
i know that if we trust in god we can get through this
it 's UNknown with his help
i can 't help it
i don 't even want it mum !
what do i do ?
bobby you 'r e not gay
mum please don 't tell anyone please
mum please don 't tell anyone
it 's gonna be fine
i was worried about you
what was i supposed to do ?
i advise you to live according to your new life in the holy spirit
then you won 't be doing what your sinful nature UNknown
when the holy spirit controls your life it will produce love joy and kindness goodness and self control
does everyone have to know ?
we 'r e your family
can i get some privacy ?
if a UNknown who wants to renounce to UNknown finds a UNknown who knows how to cure UNknown he has every chance of becoming a happy well adjusted UNknown
is that the phone ?
so you think you 'r e a UNknown ?
bobby how many girls have you been with ?
had sexual relations with ?
then how do you know for sure ?
i just have these feelings you know ?
do you want to be UNknown ?
i just wanna be close with my family again
i feel like i slipped up and now i can 't get back
i 'm not gonna be able to help you if you don 't answer my questions
no i don 't wanna be this way
i 'm gonna talk with your mother alone for a minute ok ?
she wants to talk to you
he has to be willing to really put the work in
how did it go ?
she said we should spend some more time together
that 's all she said for 60 an hour ?
i don 't know about it but it 's fine if he goes
bob i want you to be a part of this
i can 't do it alone ok ?
i read that UNknown have sex in public bathrooms and that they recruit children
what are you saying ?
do you think bobby was UNknown ?
come on mary you 'r e going overboard
you got to do something about this
i won 't lose him
dear lord we ask that you keep bobby safe from temptation
please help him return to a pure heart
do you think this will heal me ?
you have to trust the god will heal you
and that satan will try to discourage you
now let me go to sleep
when temptation is all around you faith is not enough
not just mental but physical
who would like to share their story ?
i used to be so unhappy
i stayed out all night
i talked back to my mother
since coming here and accepting jesus as my savior
my mum and i are like best friends now
the power of prayer and hard work
bobby what about you ?
i can see it in your eyes
your hard works paid off
nothing i do seems to make a difference
i try to act like them but it feels impossible
it 's an awful feeling to believe you can be headed straight for the fires of hell
even worse is everyone telling you how simple the solution is
they don 't know what it is to be in my shoes
i 'm running i 'm not eating junk food
yeah that 's good but
i don 't know the point of it
i mean my face has cleared up but everything else feels the same
well you have to stick with it
do you like the people in your group ?
you know i hope you 'r e taking this seriously
i mean that i hope you are trying with all your might
i cannot lose you to this
well this is gonna be fun
when was the last time all the griffith men went hiking together ?
well i 'm still thinking of becoming a writer
listen bobby you always had a strong imagination and we UNknown e always been alright with that
but you 'r e getting to the age where you 'r e gonna have to get practical
how did it go ?
did you two talk ?
what did you talk about ?
no but this is important
this could make him or break him
i did the best i could
is that alright with you ?
a lot of times UNknown like bobby 's can be caused by a distant father or an UNknown mother
you need to participate in this
i 'm right here mary
i UNknown e been a very good father
and maybe you don 't know this but bobby
i mean he was never into stuff that his brother and other boys were into
he 's just not interested
so i 'm not gonna force him
hi bobby i 'm sheila
mum who 's that ?
sheila is a student in my sunday school class
you got me a date ?
you need to go out with lots of girls
and your dad thinks so too
can i at least pick my own ?
do you want a brownie for energy ?
no take them up !
so you 'r e never gonna talk to me again ? ???
what if she wants me to kiss her goodnight ?
tell her you 'r e gay
did you tell your friends ?
bobby that 's not my friend
you told everyone i 'm gay ?
i haven 't told anyone
you all hate me for it
i know you don 't think i see it but i do
it 's 3 in the morning !
sorry i lost track of time
you weren 't with UNknown were you ?
this is temptation working its ways
you have to pray harder if you 'r e going to get well
she 's at work so she asked me to pick you up
you think i didn 't notice that ?
you don 't want your friends to see me
some people wouldn 't understand
and now it 's so obvious
what did you tell them ?
well look the way you 'r e wearing
and i told you time after time not to do that thing with your arm
makes you look like a girl and you continue to do it
i 'm always dressed this way
why you 'r e doing this ?
i 'm trying to help you
no you 'r e not
you 'r e trying to help you !
it 's not about me
it 's about what people think about you
imagine if they thought your son was some big queer
what 's wrong with you ?
le 't s go home !
where are you going ?
i UNknown e never seen you around here before
hi cousin i have a name
so how long you 'r e here for ?
just a day i 'm driving home tonight
i came to see my dad
but i couldn 't resist stopping by
maybe it 's not a choice
maybe i just can 't help it
aunt mary lunch is delicious
men committed shameless acts with men and received in their own 's person the due penalty for their error
you just won 't change will you ?
i can 't erase what 's in the bible
UNknown i think people should be able to love whoever they want
did i mention how good lunch is ?
even animals know what to do it with
actually our dog does it with a pillow
can we please find something different to discuss ?
ed why don 't you tell us about college ?
i dropped school last week
well what about college ?
you wanna ruin your life ?
yeah well it 's my life to ruin
you should come up and visit me in portland
it 's so great !
i used to envy you
when i came here with mum and dad i always wished your parents were my parents
you all seemed so close
well that 's over with
i think they love the sinners
they should love the son no matter what the sin
i 'm gonna start my own bible
think about coming to portland ?
you know it 's enough you go god knows where at night
but now you 'r e bringing these UNknown into my house
it 's my house too
and they 'r e my friends
is that what that boy is ?
is it a sin to have friends now too mum ?
we have a good time ok ?
we go to the rocky chore together
does it mean we 'r e all gonna get UNknown down ?
they 'r e gay aren 't they ?
when i was miserable ?
that looked like i was getting better ?
you 'r e right mum !
i 'm doomed just to roast in hell !
that 's what your bible says !
the bible also says a person can change
why do you keep choosing this ?
why would i choose this ?
why would i choose to have my entire family hate me ?
can 't you see that 's why we 'r e doing this ?
is that what love feels like ?
here 's an issue for your vacation
i hope you like it
promise me you UNknown l write and call all the time ?
you call me when you get to portland
i had this engraved with your initials
already i 'm glad to be away from walnut creek
this feels like a new life
i 'm gonna be a success in every way i can
you don 't find clubs like this back home
welcome to london house cousin
this is my cousin bobby
nice to finally meet you bobby !
my parents don 't really understand it
but they eventually came around
how did you get them to change ?
i told them accept me as i am or forget me !
i know my mum means well but i don 't know if she UNknown l ever accept me
don 't let her get to you
and don 't be afraid to stand up to her
too much flew by fast
i UNknown l call you when i get home
hey come here come here
just in time for dinner
i 'm thinking of maybe moving there for a little bit
give me a hand with this
you should start thinking about college for next fall
you need to get your UNknown first
i mean it 's ok to take some time off but
did you hear me ?
i don 't wanna know
i want you to know
we always start at the beginning every time and if we 'r e not getting any more different let 's just not go there
when i 'm with him it feels so good !
i don 't wanna hear it
and you know i don 't
i spent the last year listening to you and you 'r e gonna listen to me for once
it feels good when i 'm with david
but if he touches me in public or god forbids kisses me
because you know it 's wrong
because you told me it 's wrong
it 's not the bible
why can 't you admit that ?
why can 't you admit that you can 't stand what i am ?
what you UNknown e become !
i 'm not the perfect little bobby you always wanted
but i can 't keep apologizing for it mum
accept me as i am or forget it
i won 't have a gay son
did you really think she 'd change bobby ?
i really want you to be happy
and i 'm sure that guy 's really nice
she UNknown l never accept it
it 's gonna be a lonely life because he UNknown l never be welcome here
and for christmas thanksgiving anything
don 't worry about mum too much
she UNknown l come around
i 'm not gonna hold my breath
i UNknown l send you my first novel when i write it
you can 't expect anything different from her bobby
she 's not gonna change
birthdays were always a big deal for all of us
i 'm just not in the all of us anymore
can 't get that throughout my head
you sure this is ok ?
they 'r e gonna love you
dad do you have to tell that story ?
and i UNknown e got about a dozen more where that came from if you 'r e interested
so bobby tell us more about you
you grew up in walnut creek right ?
maybe it 's hard for them at first
they UNknown l come around
you seem like a wonderful young man
it 's great to meet you bobby
so how did you guys meet ?
sometimes i hurt so bad
i 'm slowly sinking in a vast lake of quick sand
i wish i could crawl under a rock and sleep forever
you UNknown e reached david
i 'm not here right now but if you leave a message after the beep i UNknown l get right back to you
hey david it 's bobby
i thought you 'd be there
i really need someone to talk to and i was hoping you 'd be there
please dear lord continue to convict bobby 's heart off sin
that he may find his way
you 'r e gonna be late for school
you 'r e the one who slept in
ok then we 'r e both gonna be late for school
mary you UNknown e been called up front and he said to bring your purse
probably one of the kids that needs money again
my son is dead !
my son is dead !
death of a loved one is always tragic
but the death of a young person can be particularly painful
because that person had his whole life ahead of him
bobby was only 20 years old
we UNknown l never know who he could have been
or what he could have accomplished
bobby was a good young man but he was lost
by giving into temptation he strayed
then UNknown he chose to end his life
now we know to condemn the sin not the sinner it was this sin that bobby UNknown to
it led to his unhappiness
and it led him to take his own life
as goodness begets goodness so does sin begets sin
they 'r e ok with this ?
they 'r e running low on sandwiches
mum do you think bobby got salvation ?
why would god allow booby to go to hell if it was in his power to cure him ?
i don 't know mary !
i was a friend of bobby 's
i wanna offer my condolences
he was an amazing young man
david is a good person
all of bobby 's friends were
when bobby was here he was under control
then he moves to portland and someone puts all these ideas into his head
it wasn 't like that
we 'r e his family
we know how to help me he wanted to change to be closer to god
to be closer to you !
then he went further and further into that life style and he couldn 't get out
do you believe everything they tell you in church ?
i know you and uncle bob meant with that UNknown
bobby knew the UNknown about UNknown lifestyle
bobby was good descent and kind
someone who didn 't even know bobby stood up there and condemned him and you let him
bobby did everything he could to make himself acceptable to you
he was so good and bright and funny
i 'm sorry you can 't see it that way
don 't you ever do that again !
i knew it wasn 't true
i knew god would bring you back to me
oh yeah i 'm fantastic
i think we all are
we have to deal with this as a family
you wanna get out of here maybe go for a beer ?
did he even think about what he would do to us ?
are you happy now ?
it 's not your fault
there must be other UNknown out there
other young gay people who may be thinking of taking their lives
does the church reach out to them ?
they are other churches that do that
reverend joseph asked us to tell you how sorry he is for your loss
we can come back in a couple of weeks and check in on your f
you don 't understand are you
i don 't know what to do
i need to make peace with this and i can 't
the lord says the UNknown will be thrown into the lake of fire
but he was pure of heart
he 'd never UNknown hurt anyone
dear god my relationship to you leaves something to be desired
i have never asked of you only given as i was told
your holy spirit has taught me so much
nice to have you with us mary
the bible it says that UNknown is a sin punishable by death
do you believe that ?
there are other UNknown of the bible mrs griffith
my son was gay and he killed himself
is there an other interpretation of that ?
i saw him here a couple of times
he always sat way in the back
i need to know where he is
is UNknown an unforgivable sin ?
UNknown 18 22 says if a man lies with another man it is an abomination
an abomination in that time didn 't mean sin
UNknown also goes on to say eating UNknown is an abomination
UNknown 20 13 if a man lies with another man they both should be put to death
and then he says the same thing about an UNknown or a child that UNknown their parents
and we certainly don 't interpret that scripture UNknown
in UNknown 22 if a woman is not a virgin on her wedding day she should be taken to her father 's house and stoned to death
that UNknown is ok ?
that it is UNknown in god 's eyes ?
i tell them what i believe to be the truth that god loves them as they are
god 's vengeance is great
you shouldn 't teach them that UNknown is ok
that 's not what the bible says
it just UNknown them more
mrs griffith if you 'd like to come back during the week and talk my door is open but not to be blamed ok ?
i think that we got a pretty good one nice and full
mum can we hang this one on the tree ?
mrs towns class i think
he was so proud of himself
so he can look out
i 'm gonna go check on my cookies
i found the passage you talked about
but what about sodom and UNknown ?
god UNknown the sin of UNknown
how do you explain that ?
it 's nice to see you too mary
what 's this for ?
it 's a UNknown sale
what about sodom and UNknown ?
many scholars think this sin was greed and not UNknown
and it wasn 't UNknown UNknown until years after it was written
do you have answers for all these things just to justify being that way ?
you have answers to justify that it 's wrong
i guess we 'r e in an UNknown here
so you think it 's ok to interpret the bible any way you want ?
but the bible was written and UNknown my mortal men
and many of those UNknown were UNknown of the time and what they lived
i think it 's blasphemous
i don 't think god minds questions
he might not be thrilled with all our answers
i think blind faith is just as dangerous as none at all
i UNknown e never had reasons to
sometimes to question it helps you find a deeper faith
i think the reason was he couldn 't never allow himself to feel worthy of god 's love
have you ever heard about p flag ?
it 's a national organisation
it 's parents and friend of UNknown and UNknown
no that 's not for me
there 's a woman in UNknown betty lambert
you UNknown l love her
she has a gay son in his UNknown
i just had a few questions
i don 't need anything else
there 's a passage that says if children are UNknown they should be put to death
and i mean UNknown UNknown that UNknown
well don 't you think that 's important ?
mary i wasn 't that keen with the first interpretation of the bible
well it could mean that bobby 's in heaven
why isn 't that enough for you ?
is it enough for you ? !
does it make it any better ?
everything you 'r e doing ?
what do you want me to do ?
just forget about him ?
i can 't do that
i don 't wont to forget about him mary
i want to remember him
then i want to move on
you never deal with anything
maybe if i did bobby would still be alive today ?
is that what you 'r e saying ?
is that what you think ?
you can answer me !
listen mary we both made mistakes
but it 's done he 's gone
we 'r e not gonna bring him back
i 'm so glad you called
reverend UNknown told me what happened to bobby
i can 't imagine what it must feel like to lose a child like that
six months and a few days
our son was 14 when he came out to us
isn 't that a little young ?
we mothers we always know
and you were ok with it ?
i don 't think any parent hears the news and thinks oh UNknown !
why don 't you come to a p flag meeting with me ?
i 'm not good at talking in groups
i think you UNknown l be shocked at how many people think they were the all american family
i UNknown l think about it
eric was UNknown in UNknown all the time
i can 't stay long
i was so furious i went to the principal
but he didn 't do a thing to the boys who did it
i was shocked by that
i called them fruits and UNknown
it took me a long time to accept my sam
he asked for a pink UNknown shirt for his birthday
so he tells me he 's gay
what do i do ?
there he is in his pink UNknown shirt he saw a deer and UNknown run bambi run
i always knew i could love my son
i never thought i could accept him
well when gil told me she was gay
i insisted she see a UNknown
but when that man suggested shock therapy
i looked at my baby and the hurt in her eyes
i thought this is crazy !
glad to see you 'r e all here tonight
as you may know reverend UNknown is a pastor of the metropolitan community church and he 's proposing a gay freedom day to the walnut creek city council
mary what are you doing out here ?
i didn 't know where else to go
listening to all their stories
about how they always just knew their kid was different
and then i had this dream tonight
my son was always different
his difference began at conception
i know now why god didn 't heal bobby
he didn 't heal him because there was nothing wrong with him
i killed my son !
you did not kill your son
how could god forgive me ?
how could bobby forgive me ?
god has already done the forgiving
you have to forgive yourself
i 'm so sorry !
give us something we can live with and pass on to others whose lives will never be the same because of a loved one 's death
i did not decide on brown eyes for myself
and i now realize that bobby didn 't decide to be gay
if you say in your word that it is evil and wicked to be born with no arms and a child is born with no arms
what is that child to think ?
we have a select group to debate the issue
i don 't see her it 's reverend UNknown
for one day for one day people can celebrate their difference rather than feel shame
they should be UNknown !
there are so many other people who need our time and our attention
let 's have some order here please
they spit in the face of decency and morality
i heard he tries to run for the human relations commission they picked that UNknown UNknown instead
they sent him a letter
i said UNknown e sing hymns at our church
what do you do with the hymns at your church ?
dad get in here !
UNknown are UNknown to spend eternity in hell
if they wanted to change they could be healed of their evil ways
if they would turn away from temptation they could be normal again
if only they would try and try harder if it doesn 't work
these are all the things i said to my son bobby when i found out he was gay
when he told me he was UNknown my world fell apart
i did everything i could to cure him of his sickness
8 months ago my son jumped off a bridge and killed himself
i deeply regret my lack of knowledge about gay and UNknown people
i see that everything i was taught and told was UNknown and UNknown slender
if i had investigated beyond what i was told if i had just
listened to my son when he poured his heart out to me
i would not be standing here today with you filled with regrets
i believe that god was pleased with bobby 's kind and loving spirit
bobby 's death was the direct result of his parents ignorance and fear of the word gay
he wanted to be a writer
his hopes and dreams should not have been taken from him but they were
like bobby sitting in your UNknown unknown to you they will be listening as you echo amen
and that will soon silence their prayers
their prayers to god for understanding and acceptance and for your love
but your hatred and fear and ignorance of the word gay will silence those prayers
they voted the order install
well he UNknown l try again next year right ?
so we 'r e really going to san francisco ?
i think we have to
i don 't think that 's a choice
UNknown is this everyone ?
to all the bobby and UNknown out there
i say these words to you as i would with my own precious children
you 'r e very special to me
i 'm working very hard to make this world a better and safer place for you to live in
promise me you UNknown l keep trying
bobby gave up on love
i hope you won 't
you 'r e always in my gods
my name is bobby griffith
on december 6th UNknown mary griffith testified before members of the congress of the united states
her UNknown work protecting the rights of gay and UNknown youth has established her as a major force in the fight for human rights
before you echo amen in your home or place of worship think and remember
in loving memory of bobby griffith and leroy UNknown
there is not one universe
we have the technology to travel between UNknown but travel is highly restricted and UNknown
there is not one you
each of us exists in present time in parallel UNknown
there was balance in the system but now a force exists who seeks to destroy the balance so he can become the one

there 's never been anything like what i have become
you were there for my first one
i wish i 'd never let there be a second
but there was a second
why did you come harry ?
i missed who you were
i just need to do it one more time
for these crimes you have been sentenced to life without the possibility of return on the UNknown penal colony in the hades universe
may god be with you
every universe in it is irrational sloppy
i just try to make it rational
i just try to make it neat
how could i murder myself 123 times ?
i just took those wasted energies and put them into one container me
it made me faster smarter stronger
what if that is our fate ?
to unite with our other selves
i will be the one
gabriel UNknown are you ready ?

before i saw him i felt him

i don 't want to hurt you
i don 't want to hurt you guys
he 's close to UNknown 's strength
it 's what i told you
we have a problem here
yeah the real problem is procedure sucks sir
how you going to do that ?
i UNknown l do whatever it takes
i UNknown e lived through one of those
you know what to do
us splitting up you going solo is way out of procedure
i know where you 'r e from what you UNknown e been through but this place is different
not everyone is a UNknown
there are innocent people here also
so if you get into the shit you trust your heart not your head
how did that son of a bitch get out of here ?
have you seen that new video mr fanny 's been a UNknown ?
but she don 't do guys
that girl girl stuff gets old
why don 't you rent one of those big ass she male UNknown you freak ?
i can 't determine UNknown UNknown swelling without a complete UNknown
UNknown doesn 't just kick in
the UNknown UNknown of being shot caused a UNknown break
the fifth division is looking for him
they understand he 's not himself
they know how to bring him in
no i 'm all right
i am not going to let anything happen to him
nothing you can do here and he 's likely to contact you there
if i hear from him i UNknown l let you know
i 'm going to take you
i appreciate it but i UNknown l be fine
we UNknown l make sure of it
just when i find something i like in this universe
turn off the radio slowly
you 'r e close to his strength
the last two years you UNknown e gotten stronger
haven 't UNknown any more iron
haven 't changed your diet
answers come fast without thinking
you UNknown e done this to yourself
just like old times eh buddy ?
put your hands back on the wheel UNknown
space is shaped like this
you believe this is the only universe
there 's not just one universe there 's a UNknown
every time a massive star dies and becomes a black hole a new universe is created
they UNknown e learned to forecast where and when a black hole will occur
a momentary bridge between parallel UNknown
they created an agency to police the UNknown
i 'm a UNknown agent
you 'r e a nut
you 'r e the one who 's been seeing yourself
in this universe you 'r e you
in another you don 't exist
in another you 'r e married to the same woman
in another to a different woman
in another you 'r e married to a man
there 's an energy strain wave connecting all those lives
the one between you and him has gotten stronger
you UNknown e been feeling him haven 't you ?
harry nobody 's proved that what i 'm doing is a bad thing
you UNknown e killed 123 people
i 'd say that was a very bad thing
you don 't know what 'd happen if you killed this one
what do you think would happen ?
some people think you 'd explode some people think you 'd UNknown
you 'r e missing one
some people think you 'd become a god
the man you UNknown e been seeing the you he was an UNknown agent
in doing so part of the other life 's energy transferred to him
made all of you stronger
each time he kills one of you the energy UNknown among the survivors
so i 'm next ?
you 'r e the last
you and him are it
i don 't want any part of this
you don 't have a choice
so if everything you say is true
what happens to me ?
nobody 's got all the answers
i 'm here to help you
sir i have to ask you to hold it right there
i said freeze asshole !
let them have a look first
yeah i left it on
when i got the call about gabe i just ran
grabbed my jacket rushed downstairs
i appreciate you being here with me and i don 't want to sound rude but can i have a little privacy ?
i told you it 's not wasted space
is it safe to come down ?
no there are sheriffs all over
i left it at the hospital
did you ever think when we met that day at the bookstore we 'd be in this kind of mess ?
even if i knew i still would have come in
it wasn 't a bookstore
just so you know i 'm going to take that gun and kill you before you can pull the trigger
there 's nothing you can do except give it to me
hey knock it off !
you 'r e acting like him
my grandfather taught me the energy of life goes in a circle in a perfect flow balanced
he said until i find my center my circle would never be whole
that day i first saw her in the clinic i came in with a dog that was hit by a car
i knew right away she was my center
how do i kill him ?
in an hour there 's a UNknown UNknown opening
he 's UNknown to your life wave
he UNknown l try to find you kill you and get back to the hole
that 's where we get him
you 'r e serious ?
highly UNknown m 590 hand portable system
fires 25 smart rounds per second
multiple tracking UNknown plus the latest UNknown
each round carries an explosive UNknown with UNknown fuse delays
and this is his little brother
don 't blame the tools
i never had the go ahead to terminate
let me show you how
that UNknown l work too
we kill him then it 's over
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
i know what i have to do
i UNknown l never get the chance to thank you for UNknown me away
i 'm calling the cops
just making sure you know if we kill him
you have to kill me
as long as he 's dead i don 't care
if we kill him there 's a chance some say this whole universe could go with him
the chinese guy was tearing the place apart
it 's a bomb !
you came here for me
now i 'm here for you
after this there will be only one
UNknown penal colony hades universe
UNknown opens in one minute
that 's him that 's UNknown
UNknown opens in 30 seconds
UNknown opens in 20 seconds
that man doesn 't leave this room
sir he assisted in UNknown 's capture
he 's from an UNknown universe with no travel passport
he can 't go back
they UNknown l lock him up for life
he will be cared for watched over
the UNknown closes in 40 seconds !
sir permission to speak permission denied
that order is bullshit !
i know where he has to go
i have to send you where you belong
UNknown opens in five four three two one
excuse me i have a
i 'm nobody 's bitch
what are they doing ?
they 'r e trying to rid the church of a memory one that 's haunted them for over forty years
you knew him father ?
oh yes my son i knew him
what did he do to deserve this ?
i shall tell you about him
he was a man whose life should be remembered as long as this english nation of ours loves its freedom
i first met him when i was a student at oxford
he was the best teacher i ever had the best preacher i ever heard
he UNknown both heart and mind
his biblical research convinced him that our beloved church had long since departed from the new testament
the doctor couldn 't keep silent
he called for drastic changes and that is when his troubles began to mount
the holy father has again sent warning
john UNknown must be got into line quickly and completely
let me assure you that i am most UNknown to perform the holy father 's bidding
we must not fail again this time bishop UNknown
i have assured his holiness that you have the matter under control
the political tide has shifted to our favor your grace
UNknown would have been silenced long ago but for john of UNknown 's protection
now we have the upper hand
besides UNknown 's own words in writing is all the case we need
i will see to it that his holiness is pleased
my brothers we must not see only the threat
i have longed for this opportunity
at my trial at st paul 's a year ago
i did not get to say a single word in my own defense
my UNknown and my opponents argued over protocol
and then the mob UNknown the trial
nothing was settled because nothing was discussed
now at least bishop UNknown has moved this trial to UNknown where god willing we should be free of outside disturbance
uncle i wish you wouldn 't go
i 'm sorry to leave you alone
i fear i UNknown l not see you again
i had a terrible dream last night
i dreamt you were alone on an island of rock in the middle of a vast sea
now don 't be afraid are we not in the hands of the lord ?
i expect he has much more for both of us to do
but the UNknown are saying you are a heretic that you UNknown l be seized
i shall be back before long
all the same it will be dangerous
king of heaven and earth my mind is spinning and finds no rest
how often have i been tempted to submit and withdraw my writing
yet just as often i have been led back to the authority of thy holy word
i am a man walking the edge of a precipice at midnight
i cannot deny the truth of thy scriptures
i thank thee that thou art altogether wise and gracious
lord give me the wisdom to defend thy word
whatever trials there may be
into thy hands o lord i commend my spirit whether for life or death for prison or freedom according to thy holy will
do you think we shall keep pace with these students ?
i have received word that we are to stop on our journey to confer with john of UNknown
he has UNknown you greatly in the past doctor
he 's been as devoted a patron to me as he has been to geoffrey UNknown
you may need him more than ever now
god save you dr UNknown gentlemen
good day to you sheriff
are you about your duties ?
this fine fellow 's a UNknown been robbing travelers round these parts for some time past
but it 's the hangman 's rope for him now all right
look well on this wretch young sirs and remember the fate of men who fall from the grace of god
you can save your insults sheriff
i am not fallen from god 's grace
my sins are as surely forgiven as the sins of any man in england
shall this good doctor hear your blasphemy ?
please sheriff please let him speak
i am interested to hear what he has to say
i have been a soldier of the king and i do not deserve this ill treatment
then why have you taken to this dishonorable life of stealing ?
well you know as well as i do father
it 's almost 25 years now since they fixed laborer 's wages said they couldn 't go up no more
but the cost of food goes up all the time
a man just can 't afford to earn an honest living no more
my son i know you believe you have good cause to be bitter but nothing can excuse the breaking of god 's laws
but what did you mean that you are assured the forgiveness of your sins ?
ah well i went to my priest and bought an indulgence paid good money for it too
my priest promised me that i have the stored graces of the holy church for my forgiveness
i may be a thief father but i UNknown e always been a good christian
well tell me this good christian did jesus sell UNknown like yours ?
well my indulgence is good i tell ya !
man the forgiveness of god is not to be purchased by a few coins
yes but i paid good money
my priest promised the indulgence was good
what are you saying that it 's worthless ?
god 's forgiveness and grace will give you true assurance
no indulgence can do that
i will ask the sheriff to send for my vicar at UNknown church and he will hear your confession and help you find true repentance
it is never too late
the UNknown thief who died next to christ upon the cross got the best assurance of all
thou shalt be with me in paradise
that thief needed no indulgence
if you please good sirs !
they say in the village that one of you be a great doctor of the church
if that be so may a poor man ask for some help ?
how can i help you sir ?
i do not ask for money doctor just a little of your time
how can i be of service ?
tis my wife that needs the help doctor
she is beside herself with grief for the boy child we had last year that died
i try to reason with her and comfort her but my words avail as little as a cold wind
i try not to get too fond of a child till it gets to be six years of age or so
so many of the little ones die you know
has your wife spoken to the parish priest ?
that 's the pity of it father
the babe was not baptized
t UNknown as my fault doctor
there was a special levy from the church for the pope 's army and i had no money for a donation
oh generation of UNknown !
and before i could earn money the poor babe was carried off by a fever
many months have passed but my poor wife spends every day in weeping
will you help her good sir ?
may the lord bless you and give you peace my daughter
i thank you for your kindness good doctor
but my heart is so broken it will not be comforted
you see sir what did i tell you ?
god will bring peace to your mind and your heart if you will only give him leave
his love is especially lent to broken hearts like yours
father i will tell you why my heart aches sore
some months ago a traveling UNknown came through our village and this friar told me that the spirits of UNknown infants are cursed to wander as UNknown
and now whenever i see the UNknown rise in the summer twilight
i fear that maybe the spirit of my own poor lost child is there
woman you know that god has given us a holy book to lead us into all truth
have you ever heard of the great king david ?
yes father in the mystery plays at festival time
his story is told us in the scriptures and the book reveals that one day the great king david had one of his own baby children grow sick and die
and when the child was dead david rose up and said
my child will not return to me but i shall go one day to be with him
and that was many years before the institution of baptism
oh doctor you speak so UNknown but how shall i know that one day
i shall go to be with my child ?
keep you eyes fixed on that other babe born so many years ago in bethlehem whose death did break the heart of his own dear mother the holy virgin
keep in your heart that christ died to purchase our souls by his hard suffering on the bitter cross
i am amazed doctor at the comfort you give these troubled souls you meet
their countenance changes in your very presence
ah but notice mr UNknown it is the sharing of the scriptures that gives the comfort is it not ?
well we are less than one hour from john of UNknown 's
don 't look to me this time john UNknown
i cannot save you again
i came to your rescue at st paul 's but at UNknown you will go alone
i would do you more harm than good now
now we have a ten year old boy on the throne
our dear richard is no more than a puppet in the hands of ambitious men men who are afraid
lest i should UNknown their UNknown power
now is not the time to have john of UNknown
duke of lancaster at your side
however though i shall not be present to pluck you out of trouble again
i would give you a little instruction how to UNknown yourself at UNknown
for god 's sake UNknown you 'r e sometimes so naive
this time you must try and grasp the politics of the situation
my lord your advice is always welcome but politics is your lordship 's study not my own
so you have always said
i remember when my father sent you as a delegate to the peace conference in UNknown
your arguments were good and sound but your approach so stiff and UNknown
politics is conflict my dear UNknown
like a duel or battle
fight a political enemy UNknown ting
know when to attack UNknown ting
when to defend UNknown ting
in battle that would have cost you your life squire and me a good man
be off with you !
UNknown have you been listening man ?
i hear you my lord but i cannot see how this applies to my case
then let us be a little more specific
at UNknown palace your most dangerous enemy will not be UNknown but bishop UNknown
he seeks your down fall he makes no secret of it
do not let your quick tongue fill his quiver with arrows for your own destruction
attack when you can retreat when you must
my lord knows that i shall speak truly and remain steadfast in my opinions
that is exactly what i expected you to say
you and your saxon stubbornness !
my lord would prefer me to exercise norman UNknown ?
what both our nations would have been spared
john in UNknown matters you are my champion and the champion of england
you have helped restore to the crown its dignity and prerogative as derived from god
maybe now at last we shall see an end to the dominion of UNknown and UNknown
this english nation will be a mighty one when it finds the will to rouse itself
saxon or norman we stand or fall as englishmen
but the point i make in my writing is that lordship comes from god and can only be UNknown as by a steward in his service
i confess i 'm sometimes appalled by the UNknown that political men put upon my words
yet i have written nothing but what i have learnt in god 's law
i take my stand on the scriptures
as you will argue no doubt at UNknown in your customary UNknown manner
circumstances will govern my actions my lord as the young squire 's UNknown governed yours a few moments ago
UNknown you are UNknown and i love you for it
stick to your scriptures then and be a david to bring down the goliath UNknown
and may you conquer for he 's a tool of rome and his ambition would enslave us all
i place myself in the mighty hands of god
but at UNknown you might find that he delivers you by the hands of a woman
dr UNknown you have heard the charges against you
you have heard the UNknown
you are satisfied that your teachings have been accurately presented to this court ?
i deny only that they are unorthodox
thank you my lord archbishop
dr UNknown we rejoice that you have UNknown to obey our summons
you profess doctor that the authority of human government can be higher than that of god 's church ?
i have taught that all dominion comes equally from god and can only be rightfully UNknown in obedience to god
should the church UNknown or UNknown misuse its powers then the civil authorities would have the right and the duty to correct that abuse
and who will be judge of this ?
that same civil authority ?
indeed dr UNknown is not this famous theory of dominion a mere justification for the crown to UNknown the property and prerogative of the church ?
no my lord it is not
but in the matter of property seeing that you refer to it
i see no basis in the word of god for the church to possess extreme material wealth
ah can it be that dr UNknown is jealous that he has not received the share that his great talents deserve ?
one third of the land of england is owned by the church my lord bishop
such ownership is not the business of the church
christ and his apostles lived in poverty
and how do you suggest that we should dispose of the church 's goods ?
by presenting them perhaps to the english nobility ?
i 'm sure the duke of lancaster and his party could put them to good use
let us begin there !
your own mouth UNknown you UNknown
first you seek to undermine the authority of the church of the UNknown and even of the pope
and now you instruct us how best to bring about our own downfall
you leave little room for doubt what the verdict of this court must be
one last question dr UNknown what spiritual authority would replace the one that you have just so UNknown demolished ?
your own UNknown brain ?
i have an important document for the archbishop
brothers in christ this is a letter from our queen mother
speaking on behalf of her son richard who at his majority will ascend the throne of this realm
her majesty declares that dr john UNknown has rendered long and valued service to the crown that which she asks this court to recognize
further she requests that there be no UNknown of dr UNknown
she has no right !
no right bishop UNknown no right ?
dear brothers let us proceed
i perceive his foul hand in this
queen mother would not have written so without his UNknown
so once again UNknown escapes our grasp
before god i should hope not
do you think i relish this conflict ?
i would rather have UNknown with us than against us
he 's a brilliant man his life is UNknown his devotion to god beyond question
but the man is misled
he is a heretic and he must be silenced
if he is not checked his voice could poison all of UNknown
it is said his following grows daily
his name and influence spread like the plague
you have heard my lord of the many UNknown priests he has sent into the countryside to preach the scriptures
considering what a mockery so much of the preaching of our UNknown and UNknown has become of late
i can hardly condemn him for that
sometimes i wonder is mine the only voice to be raised in defense of the true church ?
what is to be done when at the head is such a weak tool ?
UNknown blows hot and cold with every puff of wind
UNknown do not live forever my lord
but if we wait to fill dead men 's shoes we may wait too long
the bird may have flown beyond our grasp but the nest is still there for the taking
if oxford is purged of UNknown and his UNknown UNknown they will lose their UNknown
without the endorsement of the academic world the nobility will find them less attractive
ideas are only as powerful as the men that hold them
besides if the peasants get anymore troublesome than they are already the nobility will be the first to cry for law and order
and where will they turn for help ?
narrator but UNknown was allowed to remain at oxford
pope gregory died and chaos UNknown
the church broke apart with the election of two rival UNknown
england and most of europe went with pope urban vi in rome
france and a few allies supported pope clement UNknown in UNknown
in the confusion that followed
john UNknown was left free to continue his writing
ah there you are daughter
what a hunt we had today
you should have seen us
two UNknown dead within the first hour
the second nearly got poor UNknown
but why such a grim face ?
we were discussing this new book fresh from the UNknown father
it arrived the day before yesterday
well if a book will take away my daughter 's pretty smile
i regret that i ever allowed her to be taught her letters
oh it must be very serious indeed
what has the man done now ?
why father haven 't you heard ?
this book is UNknown 's attack on the church UNknown on UNknown
this time this priest has gone too far
you have gone too far john UNknown this time you have gone too far
i have just seen what you have written on the holy UNknown
you have dared to attack the UNknown of UNknown the very central UNknown of the church ?
yes my lord i have
is that all you have to say you wretched UNknown ?
you stand there in your bearded innocence and simply say yes my lord
man an attack on UNknown is an attack on the mass
an attack on the mass is an attack on the foundation of the holy church
retract retract it at once
my lord the holy scriptures tell us that jesus christ is the foundation of the church
you are attacking jesus sacrifice
i think not my lord
UNknown is a modern UNknown unknown to the fathers of the church
pope innocent ill and the fourth UNknown council first proclaimed it
less than 200 years ago
i care not when it was proclaimed
it is believed believed throughout the whole of UNknown
john you know why i ask this thing of you ?
yes my liege i think that i do
we have known each other for many years
you gave loyal service to the old king
god rest his soul i wish he was alive today
john you know well the hold you now have upon the hearts of the people of this nation
if you do not UNknown this folly a wound may open which might never heal
already there is rebellion in the air
my nephew richard is surround by fools and UNknown
my lords of gloucester and UNknown pull the strings upon which he dances and they are dangerous men
i am fearful of what chaos may be let UNknown in england
you do well to be fearful my lord
the poor of this realm have suffered too much too long
and you would do well to be fearful if you persist in this new teaching
i can do no more
your stubbornness puts you at UNknown 's mercy
i can only continue the work i have begun
man may attack the body my lord not the soul
you would not have me buy the protection of UNknown by selling my soul
may god bless your courage john
my lord it has been my privilege to serve you all these years
i thank you for all you have done to shield me
if you have to step back from me now have no fear
the lord will be my shield
i might not see your face again
this is madness john you know it is
their leader john ball has escaped from prison
that can only mean trouble
we have no business being here
how many times have i appealed on behalf of the poor of this country nicholas ?
i 'm identified with their cause
why should i not speak to these peasants when they ask to meet me ?
they are on the brink of UNknown
if it is believed that you helped to fan the flames
ah doctor UNknown you UNknown e come
but why this secrecy ?
for all our sakes doctor
we take a certain risk in talking to you and we know that you be in some considerable danger
your poor preachers come into our villages and tell the bible stories
we think you 'r e our friend too
we think you 'r e on our side
i UNknown e already declared myself on your side
well answer me this then
take care john this is a powder keg
you are fully justified in what you say
it 's time things were changed
aye it 's time for a change
it 's time to overthrow the tyrants
doctor we are many thousand strong
every man amongst us knows and honors your name
if you would help us
the purpose of my life is to help all god 's people
but tell me is it true that john ball has escaped from prison ?
you know about that ?
as a matter of fact yes it is so sir
then it is he who has stirred up this revolt ?
oh he may have stirred it up but the pot has been brewing for a long time now
he knows what to do
our lord jesus lived in an age of cruelty and injustice far worse than our own
he came to overthrow tyranny but not with the methods of tyranny
but we must work for it in his way following his word
words words the time for words is past
now is the time for weapons to speak
we UNknown e had enough of your fine gentleman 's words
what made us think that this fine oxford gentleman would dirty his hands in our cause ?
that is neither just nor true
i don 't care you say i don 't care
how many times have i spoken for your cause ?
pleaded on your behalf for mercy that your wrongs might be UNknown
i UNknown e appealed to the church begged them to look to the needs of the poor !
and now my church UNknown me
i 'm UNknown for my efforts by the civil authorities the royal court UNknown me and you say i do not care !
you must understand the way of violence is not christ 's way cannot be my way nor should it be the way of any christian man
you are a good man sir
we are not evil men neither
your priests have shown us the way of christ and we want to follow it
but it won 't put wool on our backs nor bread in our mouths
religious talk can 't stop us now
there 's been too much talk with too little results
my brothers wait our lord was not of the landed gentry
he was a common man a carpenter who left his trade to become a servant to others
he washed his disciple 's feet
god will wash the UNknown from your hearts and lead you in his way
we will see things change believe me we will
you UNknown e got to understand sir it 's gone on for too long far too long
narrator chaos and bloodshed came to england with the UNknown of the peasants revolt
the knighthood once gathered in force put down the rebellion but it was a time of disorder and violent protest against all the institutions that oppressed the common people
the nobility and many in the church began to hold john UNknown to blame for the revolt
it was charged that his UNknown made the peasants think that they were important in the eyes of god and thus they might have earthly rights too
simon UNknown the archbishop of canterbury was beheaded by the mob and in the UNknown
pope urban appointed thomas UNknown as the new archbishop of canterbury
with the supreme UNknown power in england in his hands at last
archbishop UNknown wasted no time in moving against UNknown
to chancellor UNknown at oxford without delay
it had to come john
since my appointment i UNknown e fought for your liberty to teach what you would within these walls
UNknown condemned by the UNknown court teaching forbidden by the UNknown council but it couldn 't last we both knew that
UNknown has appointed a council of 12 to UNknown the university
my authority is by license of that council
they have issued their first orders
i am to be deprived of all academic privileges ?
i do not wish to submit god knows
you have no choice chancellor
while the university remains an arm of the church you have no choice
if i resist pope urban will place an UNknown on the university
the university will lose all its hard won privileges
if i do not lose mine
precisely though i fear that won 't be the end of the matter
other heads will roll i 'm sure of that probably mine too
they have no regard for this place as the greatest center of learning in the christian world
they care only for UNknown and proper obedience
so i am to be forbidden to teach
and am i also to be denied access to the libraries for my studies ?
that is undoubtedly what the council has in view
john its intention is simply to cut you off from everything you UNknown e stood for
how can i continue my work ?
good day to you doctor
i UNknown e time for my students always
you two are near the end of your studies are you not ?
and we have something to tell you
whilst we have been at oxford we have copied all your work
the complete works of dr john UNknown
your books go with us back to bohemia
what should i say ?
i 'm astonished and delighted
sir bohemia is such a beautiful country
in prague your name is already famous
won 't you come with us ?
things are so sad for you here now
we hear you are forbidden to teach
there is danger for you here
in prague you would be honored as you deserve
a moment ago i was in deep despair and now i 'm full of joy
i thank god for two such good friends
i UNknown e always lived amongst UNknown and i confess i 'm frightened by the UNknown that 's UNknown upon my head
somehow i feel it 's not yet finished
i think there 's still work for me to do here in england
we promise doctor whatever happens here in england you your teaching will live on in the fortress mountains of bohemia
how marvelous are god 's ways
may he ever continue to do his work through you my dear sons in christ
i give thee thanks lord
o lord it shall be
what will you do at UNknown ?
have i not these eight years past been
why should i not resume my UNknown duties ?
perhaps it 's about time considering the number of sermons i UNknown e preached against UNknown UNknown
oh you know full well you UNknown e never neglected your UNknown duties neither there nor at oxford
last night in my prayers
i suddenly saw quite clearly the divine hand of providence was guiding me back to UNknown
yes and the work i must do there will be the most challenging that i shall ever face in my life as a scholar
our authority is the word of god alone
over the centuries that authority has been UNknown UNknown and now our nation our whole people our civilization UNknown for lack of the word of god
how can men live under the authority of god 's word if they do not know god 's word ?
the UNknown most of them do not even know their latin
they know still less of god 's word
it will be a glorious undertaking doctor
most of your students will want to help
there will be no lack of workers
you realize the shock waves this will send through the UNknown not to mention your opponents at canterbury
you already stand accused of heresy
UNknown the bible will be seen by some as nothing less than UNknown against our mother church
but i see it as nothing less than my sacred duty as a loyal son of christ 's church
it 's so plain to me now
how did we ever lose it ?
the new testament was written in the UNknown greek the language of the people
st jerome 's latin UNknown translation was in the common tongue
are englishmen to be deprived of the word of god because it is locked up in a foreign language ?
how can we keep a faithful church without the word of god as its bread for hungry souls ?
god be with you dr UNknown
narrator for months we labored at our great task
day after day close attention to the holy scriptures became for us a source of revelation and constantly new UNknown into the truth of god 's law
our hearts were set UNknown with the word of god
the research translation and UNknown of that word became not a task but a supreme act of worship
but he soon began to realize that the translation of the word into english was only the first step
in his second year at UNknown
UNknown suffered a stroke which left him partly crippled
i rejoice to greet you at this blessed time and i thank god that he has spared me to see this day
you know all of you that i first began to send out my little flock of poor priests during my years at oxford
they were a gallant band but after my UNknown
i never thought to UNknown over such a UNknown again
yet here you are my brave new flock
i bless you and oh how much i thank god for you
within this bill we have uncovered the UNknown UNknown of this UNknown UNknown john UNknown
when shall we be spared the venom of his pen the subversive threat of his presence ?
see for yourselves how low he has sunk
this man of former great reputation the jewel of oxford famed throughout europe for his knowledge of the scriptures and the fathers
look now at his depraved teachings
he attacks the very foundation of the church
he declares it lawful for any man to preach the word of god UNknown the necessity of the authorization of the UNknown see
this UNknown will have the people hear preaching from any common man who can open a copy of the scriptures
UNknown is called to be a steward of god
every man is responsible to god for what he does with his life
every man must stand alone before the final judgment of god
it is not enough to leave their interpretation to the church
for now what do we learn ?
that he and his UNknown have been engaged from the moment he went to UNknown in UNknown the holy scriptures into the common english tongue
shall god 's law which has come down to us in the language of learning be so UNknown so stripped of majesty so UNknown of meaning ?
how shall the vulgar tongue of common man UNknown convey its wisdom ?
do we really dare to give the word of god in the common tongue into the hands of the common people ?
do we fully understand what we are doing ?
will some not abuse misuse and UNknown the scriptures ?
my brethren of course some will
it has UNknown its abuse
we will give god 's word to god 's children and his spirit will guide them
it will take time for growth and understanding but i fear what judgment may befall us if we dare not give out this word
did not the blessed st UNknown declare that is was necessary only for god 's ordained to understand the holy scriptures ?
that they alone should communicate this knowledge ?
god has committed the treasure of his word to the keeping of his holy church that ignorant men should not UNknown them to their own damnation
it is reported your grace that UNknown 's intention is to release another band of ragged preachers upon the countryside this time armed with copies of the new translation
then they must be stopped
it shall be ordered that under king richard 's seal and upon UNknown from a bishop that henceforth all UNknown priests shall be arrested and imprisoned
my friends the way will be hard
hunger bitter cold foul words physical attack await you
it may be you will be persecuted imprisoned then like christ you will turn the other cheek if need be again and again
love him and serve him always
furthermore it is the UNknown of this UNknown that a UNknown of john UNknown be set forth with all speed
he shall at last be delivered into our hands for the judgment and UNknown he deserves
narrator UNknown never appeared at the third trial
he suffered another stroke whilst attending mass which left him paralyzed
the trial went on in his absence anyway but was interrupted but a rare and violent earthquake
my son our work must go on
it must and it will
after his death his work and influence continued to spread not only here in england but in europe too with john hus of prague
many of us were put on trial ordered to UNknown
UNknown some of us did but some of us later renounced our UNknown
but why do they dig up his grave ?
well somehow they think by burning his bones that they can erase his memory and destroy his influence
narrator the UNknown fuller wrote
they burnt his bones to ashes and cast them into swift a UNknown brook running hard by
thus this brook hath conveyed his ashes into UNknown
UNknown into the narrow seas they into the main ocean
maria with ice like you wanted
have i told you recently that you 'r e beautiful ?
thanks for my drink and by the way we 'r e out of shrimp dip
don 't they feed them at home ?
come to the kitchen !

honey i 'm taking out the trash now
we UNknown l be up all night and neither will want to take it out tomorrow
i UNknown l put the car away while i 'm at it
don 't even think about washing the dishes
roberto is a typical case of UNknown guilt
probably an appropriate neurosis of a UNknown subconscious that reflects in that UNknown attitude that solely depends on the actions of UNknown childhood UNknown
girl knowing his UNknown background i can hardly believe his new self
i swear he 's changed
hey has your baby improved in the sack ?
yes it 's getting there

i need to talk to you

lieutenant UNknown carry out detailed survey with this patrol
news is that a few rats have crossed over into our territory from the UNknown
lf you notice any suspicious activity get in touch with me immediately and pass me the information
lieutenant UNknown this is your c o
alfa to tiger come in over
sir i UNknown e a problem
not been able to establish radio contacts with both my patrols for last two weeks
there is absolutely no news of them
this is the cause of worry sir
now you do one thing colonel
wait for my further order
and please don 't send anymore search parties
let me talk to higher command
and i UNknown l get back to you
it was an ambush sir
it was so dark couldn 't tell where the enemy was
the UNknown and the UNknown troops have crossed the UNknown and UNknown several kilometers into our territory
from this information it looks like they 'r e all over the place
the UNknown valley the UNknown sector and the UNknown sector
they UNknown e taken over the whole lndian territory
and they have occupied our UNknown too
the rations our troops had left behind in the UNknown is what they 'r e feeding off to attack us !
the problem is that they 'r e watching the national highway number one through point UNknown UNknown and UNknown and continuously shelling our UNknown
sir the enemy plan is simple
to cut of kashmir from UNknown by hitting national highway number one
orders from delhi are very clear
the maximum UNknown must take place in the UNknown sector
orders are to press maximum number of battalions into service
and as we know with the enemy sitting up there at an UNknown position requiring us to attack them from down below
so the ratio will be 6 1
we UNknown l lose six they UNknown l lose one
and UNknown terrain is such where the ratio will be 10 1
and that the reason why maximum UNknown is taking place
sir let us cross the UNknown and cut off the enemy from behind
so that we lose less lives
the orders are very clear
that we UNknown l be going by the book
at no point of time we UNknown l cross the line of control
these are the clear instruction from delhi
and so let 's move 1 11 UNknown regiment first
but the 1 11 UNknown regiment has just returned from UNknown sir
they are the best fighters for this area
colonel UNknown rai will take command of the 1 11 UNknown
you are required to proceed to UNknown UNknown sector immediately
we UNknown l make arrangements to drop you at UNknown within 24 hours
i UNknown l be there sir
praised be goddess kali !
here come the UNknown !
the UNknown regiment is known for its bravery !
my brave friends battle and bloodshed aren 't unknown to us
we saw kashmir bathed in blood recently !
the UNknown regiment is famous all over the world
even hitler had once said
lf i can have the UNknown troops
i can conquer the entire world
and as your commanding officer
UNknown rai wants to see you victorious in UNknown !
praised be goddess kali !
message from the command sir
colonel UNknown move your battalion 18 grenadiers to UNknown UNknown sector immediately
you UNknown e had a narrow escape
had you got into it you 'd have been taken too
scared aren 't you ?
he was armed to his teeth
he could UNknown e killed you
and i 'm a UNknown a real man
we don 't get scared
we give others a scare
and i 'm a UNknown from UNknown
that 's the problem with you
word is that all the operations in the valley have been called off
soldiers i have received orders
the UNknown UNknown which is our territory and on which we have a post has been captured by the enemy
from there the enemy is keeping a watch on national highway number one
they are monitoring every move our UNknown are making and keeping an eagle 's eye on their activities
it 's very necessary for us to UNknown the enemy from there
we UNknown e got to launch an attack on them
they sent a couple of battalions up there
the 16 grenadiers are presently engaged in combat over there
the task is now being entrusted to us and head quarters wants us to accept it
as if there are only a dozen UNknown sitting out there !
the UNknown battalion has already got there sir
something is surely fishy sir
nobody 's telling us the whole truth
lf we are issued orders we UNknown l definitely launch an offensive sir
but the enemy 's at such a height every grenade they UNknown at us will come down at lightning speed sir
besides we have no information about the enemy sir
are they 8 in number or 800 ?
even if there are 8000 troops out there they UNknown e gotten into our house !
and we UNknown l surely throw them out sir !
easier said than done !
lf we 'r e a family you 'r e like the father among us
so why are you UNknown us to the path of cowardice ?
and that too blindfolded !
when a child walks through a dark alley he sings and whistles out of fright
we UNknown l go out singing too sir
the same old song my mother keeps humming
so lover boy tell me the truth what 's going to happen ?
are you here to win the war or correct my language ?
sir let us have your orders
colonel baba listen move your battalion 17 UNknown to UNknown sector immediately
where did you steal the ice ?
what else can one steal here ?
it 's either the splendour of nature or the chill of ice
never said the true word
now tell me what happened in the mission ?
there were four of them sir
three of them used the cover of women and children to escape but i nabbed the fourth one
you must have interrogated him then ?
but he kept crying and saying just one thing
for god 's sake shoot me why ?
he said that if he lived people of his UNknown group would kill him
but if he died his wife and kids would be paid 300 000 rupees
so it was shoot me for god 's sake
i asked him who would pay them the money ? and he said the UNknown group
sir the UNknown of afghanistan have got as far as the UNknown UNknown sir
a lot of movement is being observed in pakistan occupied kashmir sir
we must inform brigade headquarter
that we UNknown l do UNknown
you UNknown l have a lot of chances to catch terrorists today and we UNknown l get to squeeze the trigger
deepak you still had some leave to go didn 't you ?
i had leave all right sir
but i alone know how i UNknown e spent it
the coffin of a soldier arrived kept arriving in the village every other day
they were mostly from the UNknown battalion sir
deepak our battalion is headed to where these coffins are coming from
it 's to avenge those coffins that i UNknown e returned before time sir
deepak sir the enemy will now lie in coffins
you have been promoted as lieutenant colonel
i hope i deserve it sir
you take command of 13 j k rifles battalion
i go to be the commanding officer of battalion sir
things here at UNknown are pretty bad
UNknown all the operations in the valley have been cancelled
the battalion 's moving towards the UNknown sector
where 's UNknown UNknown ?
he had gone with the patrol party
we had information that some terrorists were holed up in a village five kilometers from here
he had gone after them
when did he go ?
did you try to contact him ?
i sent a patrol party
but by the time they got there he had already left
0 and the idiot didn 't even try to get in touch with us
i hope the patrol party is okay !
their security is our responsibility
let 's get him on the radio
sir UNknown UNknown has arrived !
thank god you 'r e okay
we were all so worried
major UNknown is UNknown inside
where did you slip away ?
it 's the terrorists who slipped away
people run away from trouble and you go looking for it !
it 's a man 's calling to face trouble not to run away from it
what 's all the preparation for ?
there 's said to be some problem there
i won 't have to go hunting for it anymore
how are you doing ramesh kumar ji ?
UNknown you UNknown e returned early this time ?
yes i went to your house too
your wife sent some UNknown
will give them to you later
you asked about my mother ?
so your mother finally put shackles in your feet ?
oh yes she found a bride for me this time
so what else is happening ?
major UNknown is here too
the major has returned ?
you mean he has returned from the advanced post in UNknown ?
our information is that there 's just a handful of UNknown holed up there so why move the whole battalion ?
whether this is minor trouble or major we UNknown l know only when we get there
sir when do we move ?
we have to reach UNknown in 48 hours
we UNknown l be ready sir
as soon as i got to know that the battalion is marching forward
any letter from home ?
how 's your mother keeping ?
my friends when i was a child we used to live in a mansion outside the village
whenever we had a guest we extended our hospitality to him
even when someone came uninvited we still treated him to food and sent him away
when an animal strayed into our colony we drove it away with a stick
but whenever a cheetah or a wolf came UNknown we always shot it dead
something similar has happened in our house today
a pack of wolves have got into our house
you tell me how are they to be treated ?
that 's what we 'r e going to do
so give me your word
that we will not return until we have accomplished our task
are you firm in your resolve ?
yes we are firm in our resolve !
brother dear this is an amazing thing to happen
the laddie is playing bridegroom
he leads the bridal procession sending a shiver down every spine
so bridegroom you 'r e here ?
you are the limit !
this is the first time you 'r e meeting me after your marriage
it was the way it was supposed to be
mom found a bride for me and i got married that 's it
now beauty lies in the eyes of the UNknown
so she 's beautiful !
how about her memories ?
they 'r e in my heart too
i thought you 'd say it 's all in the tummy !
now come to the point
you were the one who got married and i got almost killed
you 'r e UNknown singh UNknown
you belong to the 18 grenadiers so do i
i got a UNknown note for the wedding
i 'm glad it came here to me
had it fallen in my wife 's hands she 'd have cried my husband has got married again !
she 'd have left for this place with a stick and poor me would have taken all god gave me !
you 'd have got a nice beating from your wife !
the UNknown were okay you know
ln fact it was all very nice
i saw some people trying to snatch the national UNknown from my hands
i just wouldn 't let go of the flag
i thrashed them all on my own and drove them away
your dreams are as black as your tongue !
your dream has come true
not you alone we 'r e all going together to save the UNknown
we UNknown l thrash them with this very flag and shove them across the border
we UNknown l send them back to where they came from !
we UNknown e seen the peacock dance
we UNknown e seen the heaviest of UNknown
and now the drains tell the sea
we UNknown e seen what noise the showers can make !
brother dear this is an amazing thing to happen
the laddie is playing the bridegroom
shut up will you ?
i hear there 's a lot of tension there
maybe god has given me an opportunity
to sacrifice my life in order to protect my friends
i UNknown l never say such a thing again
i UNknown l come back and marry you
you and i will then talk about giving birth to babies okay ?
where 's the battalion ?
my battalion has left for UNknown
i 'm told there are signs of an UNknown war there
i 'm a soldier after all
and only the fortunate soldiers get to see action on the battlefield
whenever you talk about battle my heart begins to sink
don 't you dare mrs UNknown you will not shed a single tear
you thought you could go away just like that ?
i thought you were asleep
i knew you 'd be leaving early in the morning so i couldn 't go to sleep all night
you got up went to the bathroom took a shower dressed and were about to sneak out like a thief
i didn 't want to disturb anyone
lf UNknown had woken up she wouldn 't have let me leave
but you 'd still have gone away
i have just one family
the soldiers in my battalion you and UNknown
and whose support do i have ?
as if he won 't protect your battalion !
he always chooses a medium to do what he wants to do
and i think i 'm the one he has chosen
all right but do take care of yourself
nothing can happen to me
i won 't let it either !
even if death comes calling
hey UNknown why the long face ?
aunt my battalion has left UNknown for UNknown
your uncle died in the war of UNknown 5 and now you ?
lf something happens to you it UNknown l be the end of this family
mine is a huge family mother
the entire lndian army is guarding it
lf not now when again will i go to defend my motherland ?
and see me off with a smile okay ?
i UNknown e heard everything
and so the coward UNknown her eyes with tears already ?
all right i 'm a coward
not someone brave like you to send you to face the gun with a smile
nothing will happen to me silly
your love is a shield i 'm wearing
i promise i will return
lf not for anyone else it UNknown l be only for you
do come lf something happens to you the world will call me a witch who swallowed her fiance
you 'r e so worried about the world aren 't you ?
my world begins and ends with you
this time i 'm serious
look in my eyes and tell me
lf you think i 'm lying you may go away
what do you plan to do in life ?
because a soldier lives by chance loves by choice and kills by profession
i 'm very impressed mr UNknown UNknown
an officer has to spend most of his time on the borders
will you be able to live with that ?
don 't you think you are moving too fast ?
i want this relationship to be more than a mere friendship
i want to give our friendship a name will you be able to live with it ?
now you look in my eyes and tell me what do they say ?
you 'r e already fighting with me !
what will happen in the future ?
are you proposing to me ?
well yeah i suppose i am
so yes or no ?
lieutenant UNknown UNknown you are an officer
get down on your knees and ask for the lady 's hand
will you marry me please ?
show me where the burn is
want me to apply some cream on it son ?
mother your son 's joining the army where huge bombs are going to explode
will you come to kiss his hand there ?
my child i could UNknown e made some tea for you if you had come a bit earlier
ever so eager to hold my hand
i UNknown l have to wait to take his hand
what does that mean ?
he knows what i 'm talking about
he won 't let me do anything for him
he makes the tea on his own
he himself UNknown the water for a shave
he UNknown the buttons on his shirt
and he uses a brush to string his pajamas
why must you do everything on your own ?
mother you did everything for me till i grew up
now when i can do it on my own why must i make you do it ?
general UNknown UNknown some chores are meant only for women
bring home a daughter in law
it UNknown l make you happy and my burden will be taken care of too
mother don 't utter one name please
else it UNknown l ruin your son 's mood i must leave now
i UNknown e kept some UNknown on the stove
i UNknown l wait till the broth is cooked !

with you o soldier my heart my heart
the boundaries UNknown you walk on o traveler
lf you and i are not together the festival of UNknown shall be UNknown of colour
colder than ice darker than charcoal shall be the festival of UNknown without you
the clouds will learn to shed tears

although you are leaving do come back that someone waits for you don 't ever forget
without you every moment i shall spend in agony tormented by separation
with you o soldier goes my heart
the boundaries UNknown you walk on o traveler
there 's shelling taking place ahead
convey the message to the convoy
what are you thinking about ?
this can 't be the work of mere UNknown sir
to blow up an ammunition pile and the tv tower with artillery the artillery fire 's all coming from the UNknown 's isn 't it sir ?
your guess is right UNknown
but you must save your anger and your strength for the enemy
i 'm only angry with myself sir
how did the enemy cross the UNknown and get in in the first place ?
there were a few UNknown lying vacant on the UNknown
since the owners weren 't around they seemed up for grabs
that 's all right sir
even if the milk isn 't covered the dog must know where to stop
get out of these shelling area
they 'r e using heavy shelling to welcome our forces !
UNknown we had information that they and some UNknown what do you call them ?
looks like they want to wreck the national highway so they can UNknown UNknown and kashmir from the rest of the country !
i was told some rats had got in
ls that the sound of the rats ?
UNknown maybe these rats are going to bother us
UNknown UNknown one after the other !
glory to mother lndia !
sir neither has anyone seen the enemy nor heard them
who they are and in what numbers no one knows
all we see is a hail of bullets and hear the cries of those who are dying
the injured soldier must UNknown e told you something ?
they don 't even know whether the ones up there are human or beasts dogs or wolves !
dogs and wolves don 't use rocket UNknown and rifles UNknown
these men must be the crazy UNknown you have seen in the valley
the sort of UNknown they are using clearly suggests that the UNknown forces are giving them full support
this is a serious situation
those firing from up there could be just 4 in number or even four thousand
we are being thrust into a wreck we know nothing about
when one is UNknown in the darkness if not a torch one must at least have a candle sir
UNknown if you are so fond of asking questions why did you join the army ?
you ought to have gone to parliament or another government assembly
get the bravo company ready for UNknown
to understand the enemy we must learn the terrain
i need UNknown with me sir
sure but after three days of UNknown
now if anyone of you have any questions or doubts ask me right now
sir we will make contact with the enemy in three days
we UNknown l identify the enemy
sir my truck has run off the road
i need help to get it out sir
let 's go and see
c 'm on boys let 's move
which battalion are they from ?
they 'r e the dead bodies of officers and soldiers from the UNknown regiment and the grenadiers
i swear it on the milk my mother fed me
i will avenge every death !
right now i 'm not thinking of revenge
i 'm thinking of their families in whose courtyard the bodies of these martyrs will be laid
looks like there 's a lot of trouble brewing in the UNknown sector sir
let 's put the coffins inside
our information said it was about a hundred UNknown
the enemy strength is estimated to be between 2000 to 3000 troops which has taken control right from the UNknown valley to the UNknown sector
supported by pakistan 's fifth northern light UNknown
take some men to the right
sir looks like all the villagers have run away because of UNknown shelling
UNknown we have established control over the village UNknown
why don 't we make this our base camp ?
brigadier UNknown singh has issued orders that a company of our UNknown regiment will help the 3 UNknown battalion and the 16 grenadiers
they haven 't been able to make any headway towards UNknown
because of the enemy 's power of resistance
enemy at UNknown is very powerful
a man in fire power
who could be better than you to battle the enemy wrestler UNknown ?
i want you to take a company and proceed towards UNknown
but i have a request
even if don 't get any rations there should be no lack of UNknown sir
i UNknown l make sure of that
i want you to be fully prepared
i will take a company and proceed towards UNknown
tomorrow we UNknown l move at six hundred hours
i UNknown e asked you to relax although i know that any relaxation for us in the coming days is going to be extremely sinful
we have been entrusted a mission that won 't bring relaxation anywhere near us
our target will be the UNknown post
soldiers of the 3 UNknown and the 16 grenadiers have been trying to capture the post at UNknown for the past few days
but such is the fire and confidence of the enemy that our soldiers haven 't been able to move further at all
we UNknown e got to rush to their help
i know it 's not an easy job
but looking at the confidence bravery and history of the UNknown regiment it doesn 't seem difficult either
we will carry enough ammunition but do also carry a lot of stretchers
which means some of us are not going to return sir
each and every one of us will return
ln whatever state he is
that 's UNknown UNknown 's promise to you
we will not leave behind a single friend
maybe you don 't know
death is a bride that picks and chooses the most handsome of UNknown
then i don 't stand any chance sir
i 'm not handsome at all !
that 's what you think UNknown
you must ask your mother how good looking you are
sir we UNknown e established contact with 3 UNknown !
how far away are they ?
they appear to be close by sir
the enemy could be trying to deceive us
ask for the link up code
bravo one for alfa one
ln UNknown 's care over
ls he saying in UNknown 's care or is it UNknown 's banks ?
give them our position and summon them for a link up
everybody sit down in single file
a patrol party of 3 UNknown and 16 grenadiers went towards UNknown
we UNknown e been here for the last 20 days sir
we had orders not to leave our post so that more lives would not be lost
we gained control of this position with great difficulty
the UNknown are here to relieve you
we UNknown l take this route up there
this is the route our UNknown party took and they haven 't come back
this is the route i will take
oh i 'm glad to hear your voice
that 's the crazy lover
we found a telephone booth at the UNknown of the snow UNknown mountains !
does she always go wandering around ?
we UNknown l now be married
what 's there to be shy about ?
i UNknown l tell you
the marriage will take place in UNknown
it 's really very cold UNknown
but the warmth of your love helps me battle the chill
do you know me ?
not really but having heard you speak on the telephone
i UNknown e got to know a bit about you
and having heard your rubbish
captain UNknown UNknown 13 UNknown UNknown
fun and jokes were born with him and maybe they UNknown l leave with him
mr UNknown jokes are all right as long as they don 't hurt someone 's feelings
c 'm on UNknown join the queue
oh yes you 'r e newly married
at least have a word with the poor girl
tell me something is it enough that you just talk to her ?
that only a married man would be able to tell sir
and you aren 't even married yet
all i know is that my folks are waiting for UNknown to visit them on vacation so that they can handcuff him in marriage !
i 'm UNknown kumar from the j k rifles
the pining for that first union with the beloved after marriage is unique in itself
i must leave to unite with my beloved
he 's turned a poet !
the worst of UNknown turn poets
glory to UNknown chandra UNknown !
glory to UNknown UNknown !
you UNknown e eaten ?
am eating want some ?
i took some bread from bengal some from UNknown won 't i take any from u p ?
hasn 't UNknown brought anything to eat ?
i have sir loads of it
but not to be eaten
i UNknown e brought bullets sir
i UNknown l feed the UNknown
you mean you haven 't brought any food ?
i carried a lot of slugs sir
there was artillery firing here
looks like this is where the action took place
watch out there could be UNknown !
he 's still UNknown the rifle sir
even if life has deserted him the soldier still has his gun
he 's been dead for many days
he belonged to the 16 grenadiers sir
which means the rest of the missing patrol party must be somewhere around
to begin with make arrangements to take the bodies down
i UNknown e been hit by a bullet sir !
nothing will happen to you !
i UNknown e been hit sir !
you will be all right UNknown !
we UNknown e contacted the company behind us sir !
tell them that we need immediate UNknown !
till then we UNknown l hold on to our positions
hey dead meat you 'r e here to pick up the bodies ?
go ahead take them away
you can roast them in fire !
you love playing with fire don 't you ?
you 'r e the one i 'm going to roast in the fires you rotten UNknown !
it 's going to be dark soon
take cover behind the rocks
no one will open fire
why UNknown e you stopped firing you dog ?
sir our UNknown has reached
move as soon as the clouds cover the moon
lie still when the moon shows up
the enemy mustn 't get to know about our movement
praise be to goddess kali !
here comes the UNknown !
there could be mines ahead sir !
move on in the name of the goddess kali
praise to goddess kali !
here comes the UNknown !
UNknown UNknown take them on from the left
here comes the UNknown !
the c o s on the line sir
this is a great day
what 's the matter UNknown ?
it 's a great day for you sir
but for me it UNknown l always be a day when i lost my men
today i lost nine of my UNknown brothers
and right now i 'm sending their corpses to their families
i hope you will understand what i 'm going through sir
i was responsible for those soldiers
however these bloody sentiments sneak in and break the heart
let me brief you gentlemen
our primary aim is to capture point UNknown
that will cut off all the roads to UNknown valley through which the UNknown UNknown receive help
our final objective point UNknown
this point is as important as tiger hill
that 's the point from where we can keep an eye on the entire UNknown sector
you will attack point UNknown with the b company
charlie company will remain in reserve
major deepak UNknown you three UNknown seven UNknown and captain UNknown UNknown and the two of you
you will survey the heights between UNknown to UNknown
deepak you always said that our job is to hunt and destroy the enemy
well this is your chance
brigadier UNknown has given us the go ahead
UNknown you wanted to know the enemy right ?
UNknown the lndian army to them
UNknown you are trapped sonny
you will be surrounded by UNknown all your life
my sister in law is your to be wife 's best friend
and my brother is your UNknown
what will you do now ?
who knows sir whether the UNknown will be known as UNknown or vice versa ?
but the best part is when friends turn relatives it makes the journey of life even more beautiful
you 'r e dead right
too wise for your age
hope these UNknown don 't make you live with them
the enemy 's mortar position sir
as many as they need
looking at that UNknown piss
i too feel like doing it
when you got to go you got to go

but unfortunately we UNknown e lost two men sir
some wounded and some dead sir UNknown !
anyway you UNknown your positions
we UNknown l check the position sir come back soon deepak
looks like someone is coming
our friends are in bad shape

lf they can shoot a soldier in the eye imagine the UNknown position they are in
can 't see the enemy !
how far is your platoon ?
what is the position UNknown ?
sir 16 grenadiers are in real bad shape
there 's no artillery support
let 's prepare for the UNknown attack sir
sir you UNknown e got mail

must UNknown e UNknown if i 'm going home for the wedding anniversary
glory to the righteous !
may evil be vanquished !
may the world have peace
long live 18 grenadiers !
UNknown can 't see anything
besides there 's a heavy fog
what d UNknown ou say ?
yes sir it 's too foggy
UNknown singh UNknown what do you say ?
should we go ahead ?
or should we wait for the fog to clear ?
anything you think best sir
we can neither spot the enemy nor his post
and there 's this fog !
i think we should stay back
UNknown i can 't see those bastards
i don 't see them either
kill the UNknown ! !
i still can 't see those bastards
i UNknown l have to go further up
give UNknown UNknown cover fire !
UNknown ji can 't see those UNknown !
the UNknown ! are hiding
we UNknown l need eight to ten men to carry the casualties down
get me the c o immediately
i want to talk to the c o
we need artillery support sir
i 'm in enemy quarters sir
i cannot lose ground sir !
i cannot do that sir
we UNknown l take our casualties down before sunrise
we UNknown l UNknown them and get them tomorrow night sir
i totally agree with you
i don 't want to lose any more lives
UNknown i 'm going towards the UNknown bunker
to mother lndia glory be !
boys before coming to UNknown the c o told us that our platoon 's slogan is victory or UNknown !
the time has come to crush the enemy
the time has come to avenge our dead comrades to avenge our wounded UNknown in the hills
whoever wants to write to his family may write and hand over the letter to the c o
you have half an hour
lf you consent the soldiers first ?
here call home go on
lf i fail to return you will give my daughter 's hand away in marriage sir
you will perform the ritual yourself
it 's the same thing sir
all i regret is that i couldn 't talk to my wife and children
UNknown what is the position ?
many of us are wounded sir several dead sir
how far away is UNknown ?
he 's 6 to 12 UNknown away from UNknown 's body sir
and he 's trying to bring him down sir
all right i want to go close to UNknown 's body
it 's too dangerous for you sir
just give me cover fire okay ?
where 's UNknown UNknown 's body ?
a little up ahead near his wireless operator sir
i tried to go there twice sir
i don 't care UNknown
i want to go to him no sir !
where are you hit ?
it UNknown l require seven eight men to take me down
it UNknown l weaken our UNknown 's strength
UNknown sir is hit !
UNknown sir is hit !
nothing 's happened to me sir
why did you come up sir ?
you shouldn 't have taken chances sir
UNknown are you alright ?
eight men will be engaged sir
it UNknown l weaken our UNknown 's strength
please let me talk to UNknown
UNknown this is UNknown here
we need artillery support sir
colonel UNknown hold your position and don 't move forward
i don 't want anymore casualties
2 raj UNknown is here as UNknown
command is also giving us artillery support
we have lost UNknown and UNknown
no one will fire no one will move until UNknown arrives
so the boys of 13 UNknown UNknown are here
i was expecting you colonel
besides in the army the word is that
lf want to know just ask joe
lf you have a question ask UNknown
you are embarrassing me sir
no joe no UNknown sir
national highway number one is our lifeline sir
and to protect it it is imperative to kick the enemy out of UNknown 18 grenadiers have made four attempts
that 's because sir let give them their dues they barely had the time to UNknown they had no artillery support
they had no idea about the enemy 's strength
they had no time for rehearsals either sir
but your battalion has had enough time for UNknown sir and has received artillery support too
but whether or not we receive artillery support whether or not we find time for UNknown
UNknown rifles will capture UNknown
and do you know why colonel
because defeat and failure are words that are not in raj UNknown 's history
may it come true sir
but in case you fail in your UNknown 13 UNknown rifles will have to do the job
i 'm not saying it sir
these are the orders from headquarter
victory and glory will be ours
there 's a price to be paid for success sir
try and keep the count low
because every son of our army who gives up his life takes with him some moments of my life
you are a sentimental man colonel
the c o has put us on UNknown practice
why not do or die ?
why talk about dying sir ?
looks like your conversation with ms UNknown over the phone wasn 't a pleasant one
yes i had called her up
she hung up the moment she heard me
by now her trash bin must be full of letters
she takes pains to heal the sick
but she can 't feed my father
i think you and ms UNknown will make a fresh beginning
sir i 'm ready for UNknown
robin how did you get the name UNknown ?
my father was posted in UNknown
he was commanding a brigade of UNknown tanks
that 's how i got the name UNknown
hey don 't mind me getting personal
i met her in delhi and fell in love with her
for my sake UNknown will first win her parents over

the heart seeks more sir
we 'r e attacking UNknown
we 'r e going to capture UNknown

this heart seeks much more
UNknown no matter how high i go never ever forget this friend of yours

the UNknown is a pretty damn good gun
UNknown or no UNknown this gun will win the war for us
victory will be ours gentlemen
a penny for your thoughts UNknown ji !
when you have bullets flying all around you who do you think of most ?
it 's your folks isn 't it ?
it 's like this UNknown ji
when you 'r e approaching your death you think of life even more strongly
you think of your life or your wife ?
and she tells me that i don 't think of her
i 'd think of you if i had ever forgotten you darling
when i haven 't ever forgotten you how am i going to think of you ?
you need such a huge gun to kill a tiger ?
it isn 't a gun
it 's the UNknown tank
wherever i go at every step every moment yours is the memory that lives in my heart
the world in my eyes lies barren
the world in my heart however UNknown because of you
wherever i go at every step every moment
how will i forget that moment of separation ?
it still drives me insane
your UNknown of tears while parting
your way of watching me from the window
the way you look back and smile
wherever i go at every step every moment yours is the memory that lives in my heart
wherever i go at every step every moment
those moments in the swaying green fields
and the time i spent there waiting for you
your UNknown when you came closer to me
and the melody of the flute being played at a distance
i remember UNknown how you UNknown
every time someone arrived you thought it was me
wherever i go at every step every moment yours is the memory that lives in my heart
wherever i go at every step every moment
seated in a flower decked palanquin
you are smiling like a newly wed bride
where it 's your writ that rules the roost
i miss that house very much
a childhood spent on my knees crawling as a baby
wherever i go at every step every moment yours is the memory that lives in my heart
wherever i go at every step every moment yours is the memory that lives in my heart
i remember how you came running
i remember how you used to meet me
i remember how your silent lips moved
wherever i go at every step every moment yours is the memory that lives in my heart
the world in my eyes lies barren
the world in my heart however UNknown because of you
this is the final assault plan 17 UNknown takes 3 UNknown
13 j k takes UNknown 1 11 UNknown takes UNknown 18 grenadiers takes tiger hill
god willing victory will be ours
officers of the 11 UNknown the UNknown and brave soldiers any officer of the army is as good as his battalion
the bravery and courage you soldiers and lieutenant UNknown UNknown displayed in the victory at UNknown makes me hold my head high with pride !
i wish to thank all of you
it 's time we raised our heads in the battalion even higher !
we have been entrusted the task of capturing UNknown
the 22 grenadiers are trapped there and they have very little time
lf we don 't get there at the earliest they will all lose their lives
at sunset we will move towards UNknown
let me spell out our plan of attack
to begin with we will have to cross this river
the lndian forces are crossing the river
get the artillery fire started !
let me go leave me alone !
let go of me !
what happened UNknown UNknown ?
he tried to shoot himself sir !
i can understand your sorrow but you are a brave UNknown
kill before you die !
avenge UNknown 's death !
kill the UNknown enemy who have widowed your sister !
now pick up that gun and fire at the enemy not at yourself !
you have handled the situation very well i must say
you used a lot of wisdom and patience to UNknown the platoon against the enemy
son you have been outstanding !
you 'r e speaking UNknown and you 'r e not a UNknown are you ?
so what if i 'm not a UNknown ?
i 'm their son in law !
i have two daughters who speak UNknown UNknown too
you must be missing them very much ?
who can one think of in a situation like this one UNknown ?
it 's either god or your family
who do you think of UNknown ?
but right now i only have UNknown on my mind
we UNknown e got to win UNknown sir
you 'r e high on victory UNknown
you first won UNknown then UNknown and now it 's the turn of UNknown
you 'r e right sir
it 's a permanent high
and what if we lose ?
what 's all this ?
please keep this ring sir
my fiance gave it to me
lf i don 't return please give it back to her
what rubbish are you talking ?
don 't say all this !
and you will return victorious !
god willing that will be the case sir
but still please keep the ring
a debt in love is unbearable sir
who else can it be ?
i 'm proud of you UNknown
you and your battalion are the toast of the nation
we have won point UNknown
so you 'r e coming back now aren 't you ?
once we have captured point UNknown i will return
suppose i don 't return find someone else and
you have the engagement ring with you don 't you ?
and it UNknown l bring you to me in bridal UNknown
okay love lf you insist
the UNknown has suddenly fallen silent !
say something what must i say ?
or you could say very well then in UNknown
you 'r e getting poetic !
it 's these moments of life that give birth to poetry
UNknown we are ready to leave
listen you have a very bad habit
you never turn to look back when you 'r e going away
but do this look back this time else i UNknown l keep standing here all my life
but i have a condition
should something happen to me you mustn 't look back either
you must always move ahead
you haven 't understood me at all
it 's easy to rid yourself of life but not UNknown
UNknown ji ? ls it really you ?
your mother 's delighted UNknown ji !
i had a feeling that you would yourself pick up the phone mother
what will i tell you about the phone UNknown ji ?
they gave us a connection in just 10 days
they said our lad is a very big officer in the army
he has to have a telephone connection
when the bell rang after a week they said
i said i would surely treat them to sweets as soon as my UNknown ji returned
but since you UNknown e called today UNknown ji
i will surely serve them sweets
i UNknown l invite them over and treat them to sweets
i haven 't phoned for all of them
tell me how are you ?
i 'm okay UNknown ji
what can i do ?
the folks from the newspapers and the tv channels have UNknown me no end
they say that the place you are in is UNknown a UNknown
ls it true UNknown ji ?
you 'r e my mother and yet you talk like this ?
these guys from the papers and tv want to scare people to make money
there 's nothing of the sort here
we 'r e absolutely all right
hey what noise was that ?
there 's bound to be some thunder
give the phone to father
your father has gone out
he keeps reading the newspaper to keep track of you and your battalion
i UNknown l try mother
but maybe this is my last call
why do you say such a thing UNknown ji ?
i mean it 's a battery operated phone mother
the battery can run out
what 's she doing there ?
she 's a very sweet girl my son
she keeps serving me all day
she either sits in your room or with us
here you are talk to her
are you ready to leave ?
have you packed everything ?
a toothbrush a comb your shaving kit pants and shirts UNknown ?
keep a count of what you 'r e taking and bring it all back
don 't show your heroics in the snow there
lf the chill gets to you you UNknown l be rid of all the heroics !
you won 't find your mother there nor UNknown
there UNknown l be no one to ask about you
you will write letters won 't you ?
even if you don 't it 's all right
your letters are ice cold anyway
enough now stop the drama
i don 't want you to come to the station
because i know the state of your heart far better than you do
you UNknown l shed tears there in everybody 's presence and i won 't like it
i will shed tears because you 'r e going away ?
oh yes i know my name too
will you say something further ?
you were talking to her
yes we had come down the mountain after winning point UNknown
it looked as if she is the one who 's marrying you and not me !
UNknown i always thought you were half mad
but today i know for sure that you are absolutely mad !
you weren 't looking very happy
you can 't deceive UNknown
not where vicky is concerned
there 's a price to be paid for every victory in war
a lot of soldiers in our battalion were UNknown
it 's part of the game
but he was a very lovable guy
he had promised to attend our wedding to dance in the bridal procession
i wish i could fly down there and share your sorrow
you are always with me UNknown
you 'r e coming for a vacation aren 't you ?
i have made an application but it isn 't for leave
it 's to leave for point UNknown
what are you crazy ?
my heart seeks more !
have you ever considered what i 'm going through ?
lf i can 't then promise me you will never look back
vicky you will never change
you make me laugh one moment and make me cry the next
this is what life is all about UNknown
i don 't want a sermon !
i want only vicky !
and don 't overdo the heroics
i 'm insecure about you
i 'm afraid of losing you
you 'r e getting sentimental because you 'r e leaving vicky
i 'm not going anywhere
i wouldn 't have faced the tension if we were married
but you know my parents don 't approve
what are you thinking about now ?
there is a way out
you now belong to me
a song of love you must sing for me my love
whether i want to or not
i UNknown l have to go away
my heart and soul the ties of our love implore you to stay for a few moments
you mustn 't ever stop him like this
ls there another woman ? why are you in such a hurry ?
whether i want to or not
i UNknown l have to go away
my heart and soul the ties of our love stop you for a few moments
when someone is leaving you mustn 't ever stop him like this
ls there another woman ? why are you in such a hurry ?
when i have to leave for someplace don 't be upset with me like this
don 't bob your head don 't stomp your feet
don 't heave a UNknown sigh like this
go away why must you bother about me ?
you won 't listen to whatever i say
i do grieve having to leave
but this grief i must wear with grace
my heart and soul the ties of our love stop you for a few moments
when someone is leaving you mustn 't ever stop him like this
a song of love you must sing for me my love
roses shall blossom as long as the UNknown exist
should our eden be set on fire where would you and i go ?
my heart is on fire why have you no inkling of that ?
the fire in your heart you must suppress for a few days to come
my heart and soul the ties of our love stop you for a few moments
you mustn 't ever stop him like this
a song of love you must sing for me my love
i must leave by the evening train
how 's that possible ?
it 's my birthday tomorrow and you 'r e going away ?
please stay over for another day
lf you go away i will never talk to you again
you must forget whatever there was between you and me
days of our union and these precious moments
black clouds shall blow away and we lovers shall meet right here
lf that is a promise don 't ever forget it
you must rock me in the swing of spring
it 's what you said
i UNknown l have to come this spring
my heart and soul the ties of our love stop you for a few moments
when someone is leaving you mustn 't ever stop him like this
a song of love you must sing for me my love
i UNknown l either UNknown the UNknown on the high peaks or come back wrapped in the flag
but come back i surely will !
you and i are separated what reason shall i tell you has brought this about ?
i have taken this soil to be my mother and this is all i know
no peril shall my mother ever face the national flag shall forever flutter in glory
those that have evil in their hearts this much we must make them see
never shall the himalayas bow
nor shall the ganga stop flowing
are you scared of these fireworks ?
our task is to take control of point UNknown
your commander must UNknown e explained it to you
our aim is to crush the rats that have penetrated our territory across the UNknown and push them back across the border !
each one of you will take care of the soldier ahead of you

and god will take care of all of us !
whatever name you know him by
brothers have faith in god

god willing i will take you all up there and come down with you too
to the c o UNknown
friends victory will be ours !
because god is with us !

i 'm depending on you
i won 't let you down sir
god be with you deepak
i know UNknown will be watching your back
he won 't take his eyes off you

this is the time to forget friendship and relationships
UNknown you gave me the ring your fiancee had given you
it was yours and shall always be yours
where is the location of your company ?
it UNknown l take an hour to reach the location of our company sir
quickly take me to your company

the company 's down there

so what 's the position ?
not good at all sir
but i could UNknown e been better if the UNknown had not received reinforcements
behind those UNknown is their UNknown sir
that 's where their troops came from
but you attacked them didn 't you ?
god bless our UNknown UNknown UNknown who suggested the idea
our soldiers tied green bands on their heads and climbed the mountain with the chant allah ho akbar
the UNknown thought they were being joined by more reinforcements
they extended a hand to pull them up only to bite the bullet !
that 's not all sir
when we ran out of green cloth our soldiers tore it out of the national UNknown and tied it around their head sir that 's wonderful
the UNknown refuse to understand that there are more UNknown here in lndia than in pakistan and that they are lndians first and UNknown later !
i 'm proud of you
no one will fire get down there
UNknown pass your message over
send my beloved here sir

and you 'r e already leaving me ?
okay i UNknown l stay !
i 'm not going back !

and i want it now i want the bastard now
i UNknown l do it sir
besides we can 't see the gun positions
we must complete our attack before dawn
or those bastards will see every movement of ours and casualties will rise

mr grieves i 'm zoe
if you UNknown l just undress and slip into these
dr UNknown will be in to talk to you
in the meantime just put your clothes on the bed
i 'm sure she 's seen it all
safe to say there was nothing left to hit the fan
i UNknown e never heard that one
right because of the you know
well there seems to be nothing but confusion around here this morning
well then with the first day of construction on the east ward all the computers are down
we even had some trouble finding your records
but as we UNknown are very fond of saying
so a UNknown is a UNknown UNknown UNknown examination of your UNknown
very simply we use the UNknown to look for UNknown or any other UNknown inside the large UNknown
what 's that for ?
it 's a fairly short acting anesthetic
we 'r e all set here
my degree is from chicago not UNknown
she 's not my wife
yes i UNknown l be here
that has never happened before
we will get you some UNknown
and bill me for it
i think this will be on the house
mr grieve are you okay ?
there was a power UNknown
but we 'r e back now emergency power
they all look the same right ?
how are you feeling ?
you don 't feel warm
let me go tell the doctor
it 's quite a home george
you think you deserve it ?
what are you fucking kidding me ?
do you even know what you do ?
so you can think you UNknown e got the right to ask me such an UNknown question ?
and i know what 's important to you
billy you know you show up here out of the blue and ask me to what justify my career ?
it 's UNknown i think
not to mention at the end of the night you UNknown l be hitting me up for some cash
boys there 's a birthday party inside
it 's my birthday party
i UNknown l be outside if i want
i raised two perfect kids you 'd think i could keep an olive tree alive

yeah see he believes the devil or satan you know he expresses himself through people
hey dad he 's like he 's fearless
eddie it 's all staged
that 's the thing it 's not
how do you know that ?
because i looked him up online
the guy he was a professor at san francisco state and he just left the university to like live his research
you know what i 'm afraid of ?
how about the revenge of UNknown UNknown ?
what have you been reading ?
dad you are a white liberal male living in a hostile world
the white male part is what makes you feel responsible makes you feel guilty
UNknown it 's pretty easy
hey did you see his glasses ?
where 's my wife ?
and so is dr UNknown
this will just take a minute and you UNknown l feel so much better
there 's nothing like fresh sheets
it 's kind of a drag actually
like i don 't belong here
like i 'm not a nurse
like i 'm not devoted to the welfare of those committed to my care
that 's from the florence nightingale pledge that i learned in nursing school
nursing is all that i ever wanted to do
and since i UNknown e been at mt
UNknown i UNknown e had three patients ask me to pose for internet porn sites
flirting is kind of part of the job i guess
i 'm sure they 'r e coming any minute now
most people have never even heard of this
illness caused by medical examination or treatment
that 's a hell of a middle school
actually ned 's in high school now
you go in with one problem come out with another ?
in a 10 year period right 7 8 million UNknown deaths
that is more than all the casualties from all the wars fought
i UNknown e never heard of that
the health care system is this nation 's number one killer
but the lawyers are making the real killing
what are they giving ?
what are they giving ?
i 'm just so not here
i 'm so out of it
you 'r e the from UNknown

paying folks 200 bucks to come in
and have an unnecessary surgery

the surgery UNknown bill the insurance companies 10 20 grand to cut on UNknown
what a UNknown surgery ?
unnecessary nose jobs UNknown bullshit UNknown
they go in right here make a small UNknown put in an UNknown collapse a lung and snip a nerve somewhere near your spine
they gave me one of those fucking UNknown
we have to establish the time line
the chain of events that led to all of this
well i know it wasn 't ben UNknown 's fault
the human errors the UNknown it 's the system
the whole system the whole fucking hospital not just ben
wait ben you 'r e on a first name basis with this guy now ?
mr grieves i 'm dr UNknown

the shit you don 't know is just the shit you don 't want to look at
but it 's all there right there floating
your fear my fear that 's what they depend on
in a little white lab

that 's where it happens
go over there and remember
if you think you can 't help yourself you 'r e wrong
twenty years ago he came to me and he said
frank there is a place that is everywhere and nowhere and has no center
do you know what it is ?
and i said god ?
where information lives in transit
i think i 'm gonna cry
and that we could retire by the time we were 40
oh sure any day now
and we almost could if we wanted to but only because of you
yes this is just a little something just till you can eat solid food
looks like homemade wrapping paper
that looks like that tree in your back yard
it 's homemade organic banana leaf

who is this from ?
it 's a leather this is a leather binding

i prefer to do all of my volunteer work right here at home
since the day you told me i would never want or need for anything for the rest of my life
though i UNknown l probably get captured by UNknown rebels
you might get lucky never see me again

and look what happened to you
i don 't understand how something like that could happen
last night a male nurse
a black man with a red bow tie

i bet you make a bundle
i bet you can tell me what they UNknown e been putting in this iv
UNknown and UNknown every six hours
our records indicate that on the 23rd you were admitted for routine UNknown
i guess a mistake was fucking made
how did it go ?
i assume that mr grieves got the UNknown
yes actually i wasn 't fucking talking to you
how did it go ?
mr grieves procedure was complicated by the fact that
the fact that he wasn 't clean he wasn 't prepared ?
what does this file mean to you ?
this file contains the medical records of mr george UNknown
no no that 's my where 's ira ?
where 's my attorney ?
he 's on his way george
i wanna leave this place
i wanna leave right fucking now !
leaving is not an option mr grieves
i want you to get me out of this place
no you cannot leave right now
you gotta get me out of this place
you gotta help me out
you gotta call the police
you gotta tell the police to go to the east ward
jenny knows where it is
jenny can take you to the east ward can 't you ?
you gotta take them to the east ward because they 'r e
they 'r e UNknown people ira
it 's a scam and they 'r e doing it right here in this fucking hospital okay ?

abandoned wait hold on the day toxic shock UNknown
you UNknown e lost a little time george
caused by a UNknown infection in your UNknown UNknown
the extent of the infection is to be determined
you 'r e not you 'r e not touching me
you 'r e not coming anywhere near me
you 'r e not opening my chest
a procedure which is seriously compromised by the presence of a UNknown UNknown in your leg
what 's wrong with my leg ?
you UNknown e tested positive for a group a UNknown infection
we believe it began at the site of a minor trauma caused by nurse UNknown 's carelessness in moving you to a wheelchair
when i get through with them george you are gonna own this hospital
it 's my fucking leg
it 's best to stay seated
it 's my fucking leg
it 's a new car !
it 's just a plant
no that is not just a plant
it 's an olive tree
dad 's other tree got an infection
this is UNknown with a y
hi UNknown with a y
i need to ask you
when i was little like 5 we went to the bakery on sunday morning to get like UNknown or something and it was raining remember ?
you parked in front of the bakery and you turned to me
and i said like what ?
and you just said yes
and i said yes what ?
why did you say that ?
i want you to tell me what that meant
because i 'm 16 now daddy
i don 't wanna have to wonder about it anymore
you can tell me in front of her
you can say anything in front of her
you were sitting there in the seat next to me and i was just so filled with love for you
and i knew that one day you would come to me and you would ask me for something something that you needed and that only i could give you
and that morning i decided to give you the answer so that when the day did come i could remind you of that moment
yeah can i like see it ?
no i really don 't think that 's a good idea
you were talking to billy
you 'r e staring at the pool
what are you thinking about ?
you can remember better when you close your eyes
i don 't have much time
i 'm not supposed to be here
it 's not your fault
it 's not your fault
i was supposed to take care of you and i hurt you
i don 't know how to fix that
you could have gotten me in trouble
you know i don 't want you to leave
but i need to know
i 'm not one of them
let but you are here
is it all good ?
you know it 's important to remember all that stuff
no matter how much you 'r e afraid i won 't turn out right or worry about stuff
i 'm still a kid
these are the wages of fear
and this is george grieves
as you can see his eyes are still open and this is how he sees himself now
it 's different from how he saw himself before
now maybe if you spend your whole life worrying the only way that your life will have meaning is if what you fear becomes real
get out of the room
i UNknown l see you tomorrow
for a little lesson ?
to be set free ?
for a dose of reality ?
do you know who i am ?
i told you my name bitch
i know you didn 't forget that
but do you know who i am ?
no i mean in a UNknown sense motherfucker
do you know what i am ?
i 'm the morbid oppression of the night
i am the fear behind your left UNknown
i am mud hut building spear UNknown darkest africa
i am the king of egypt
grandpappy of all the sand UNknown
the lord of they them and all them that be other
i am the army of islam
i 'm the UNknown cell yard ape who 's been fucking with your UNknown
i am the medicine man
the spade digging your grave
the spook who goes bump in your night
i am the uppity field nigger dancing in your end zone and UNknown your iv
i am little black UNknown
i am lincoln 's mistake
i just been fucking with you my little bleached brother
but now you 'r e gonna face your fear
you won 't be afraid no more
i 'm gonna set you free
i 'm doing you a favor
ain 't it better to know that all the fears that go UNknown patter in your UNknown fish white belly are real ?
that you ain 't just another white liberal male guilt ridden motherfucker worrying about shit he don 't understand ?
the dark unknown 's gonna cut you up
and when i 'm done with you you ain 't gonna be a pussy no more
because UNknown and UNknown they teach you how by claiming to know what 's inside the dark
and you never grow up
you 'r e still just a kid looking to those who wear the threads of authority
the righteous rags of power
the two piece red tie blue suit uniforms of office
the daddy figure you gave jurisdiction over your freedom
a frame of fucking mind
that be one signal fucking moment
so how do you know ?
how do i know what ?
look into her eyes that 's how i know
you can 't just look into someone 's eyes and get a sense of their soul george
she gave up her career to raise your kids
suffered with you through the dot com crash
now the kids are almost adults
she 's facing the fact she UNknown l never hold her child in her arms again
nothing left but starting all over again in a youth dominated affirmative action driven job market in an uncertain fear UNknown world
or spending some 30 odd years relying on you to pay the bills and figuring out what she 's gonna do with her time or where she 's gonna worry
and you think that you can look into her eyes ?
brother you don 't have a clue
you need to explain this to me
a UNknown UNknown air UNknown after a routine UNknown UNknown
it 's virtually unheard of
what is it exactly ?
a UNknown air UNknown it 's the introduction of air into the UNknown system as a result
as a consequence of trauma or UNknown complications
it 's a technical term
it means an illness or complication
that 's been brought on by UNknown he knows what it means
ten months ago he UNknown george 's UNknown with an UNknown the son of a bitch
please do not talk to me
are you catching this george ?
they be talking truth out there boy
can you hear them ?
well don 't pay them no mind
because we know the real deal in here
ain 't that right ?
which one of them little UNknown gonna go all the way home ?
you 'r e a lawyer
i 'm also a board certified UNknown
then explain this to me carefully please
he the one that stayed home or the one that had roast beef ?
a UNknown state such as this is the result of severe brain damage
it is a UNknown from coma to a state of UNknown without UNknown UNknown
they may experience sleep wake UNknown even exhibit teeth grinding swallowing grunting moaning screaming shedding tears even smiling
but these UNknown are not UNknown to any psychological or physical UNknown
there is no evidence of higher brain function
only two more little UNknown to go
now a UNknown or persistent UNknown state is declared when a patient fails to emerge from a UNknown state within 30 days
the fact is it has been seven months since he emerged from an 84 day coma into a non responsive sleep wake cycle
the chances that a 40 year old persistent UNknown state patient will recover consciousness are slim to none
what are our options ?
she ain 't no use no more
and i wouldn 't be counting on no hand jobs in the near future either
they 'r e deciding your fate out there daddy o
what do you say we just leave the mess till tomorrow ?
you 'r e a heroic motherfucker now
ain 't nothing gonna hold you back
may you and i have a moment alone ?
anything you have to say you can say in front of the family
you think we should pull the plug ?
without UNknown the specific provisions of the will itself
don 't you make more money by keeping him alive ?
i beg your pardon ?
his insurance is still good right ?
no that 's not what we 'r e about
you 'r e not in business ?
you won 't make money off my brother 's insurance by giving him a bed a UNknown for the next two three four five years ?
we are health care professionals
who just happened to fuck him up
if you 'r e insinuating insinuating !
you guys put him here
mrs grieves if you do have power of attorney as a medical professional it is my opinion that you should authorize us to discontinue artificial life support
there 's a person in here
my husband is in here
and i can tell just by looking into his eyes
i 'm gonna keep you alive george
you know what they say
if you fall in a dream
well maybe when people die in their sleep they 'r e actually dreaming of falling and they land
you know i mean hit bottom in the dream and then they really die
UNknown book by toni UNknown
when you 'r e at the bottom toni once told me at the foot of the wall and you look up you ask yourself
how can anyone climb that ?
why would anyone even want to ?
but hours later when you 'r e at the top
looking down you UNknown e forgotten everything
except the one person you promised you would come back to
based on a true story
the wall of death this perilous alpine face is often called
but german flying ace ernst UNknown UNknown comes within 20 metres of its icy cliffs in search of the missing munich UNknown
max UNknown and karl UNknown
after UNknown into the middle of the face our brave troopers died in their UNknown
after the tragedy the UNknown of UNknown decreed that climbing the north face is strictly forbidden
but will this piece of paper hold back german youth ?
with the olympic games approaching our proud youth senses not only the peril but also the lure this challenge of their skills
for one thing is certain
the first men to summit will be celebrated as olympic heroes
and so the battle cry echoes through europe
attack the UNknown north face !
we must conquer the last problem of the alps !
UNknown may 1936 UNknown at the UNknown UNknown
maybe it 's just too early in the season for mountain climbing
die hard UNknown die easier than you think
humans are foolhardy by nature
do you know what this is ?
the reich press secretary UNknown us to focus on the first UNknown of the UNknown
i want a german first UNknown soon or you UNknown l be climbing it yourself
henry what about that pair from UNknown ?
it was in the local paper
what do you mean by courts ?
UNknown UNknown and toni UNknown
they UNknown l scale anything tall
it 's all they ever thought about as kids
put one and one together
what have they dreamed about since they were kids ?
about the UNknown of course
climbing it first olympic gold etc
i 'm from UNknown too
we practically grew up together
i know almost everything about them
around noon after 27 hours of struggle we UNknown and shook hands in silence
your private UNknown is a mountain poet
but they 'r e also highly talented
that was a first UNknown
nobody thought it was possible
why aren 't they in UNknown attempting to climb the UNknown ?
oh she doesn 't know
this will get you 40 marks for travel expenses
then go to the UNknown and have them give you a UNknown
and then off you go to UNknown
bring back a nice story child
look anything like german heroes ?
more german and heroic than either of us
have we learned what curfew means ?
or do you still think UNknown mountains excuses you from looking at your watches ?
company sergeant sir we don 't own watches
in that case UNknown i UNknown l tell you how long it is until quitting time
exactly four UNknown in the staff building two company UNknown in barrack v and one floor in the officer 's casino
company sergeant sir we don 't own watches
we UNknown l never make it this way
let 's UNknown from below
c 'm on never say never
you need to do more push ups UNknown
but it was a good idea
maybe it still needs a little work
you need to work on hammering in UNknown
here 's to the new UNknown UNknown route !
you know what i 'm talking about
c 'm on toni we can beat those two left handed
i know you you want to do the UNknown too
or why did we scale the south face of the UNknown ?
in the newspaper you yourself wrote
i know what i wrote
i 'm not scared of anything
hi mrs UNknown i 'm bringing your toni back home
glad you got back safely
i usually don 't work in this jacket
UNknown is a photo journalist now
and what do you do ?
for now in the beginning i mostly make coffee
i UNknown l just take these things inside
maybe you UNknown l come tonight after all ?
now that UNknown is coming too
where am i coming too ?
he 's game for anything
when did you start smoking ?
i read your article in the local newspaper
my boss read it too
you 'r e the talk of berlin
you and the other top UNknown
with the olympics coming up they 'r e pushing the UNknown
that 's why you 'r e here ?
UNknown is making her career in the capital UNknown
don 't you wish you could too ?
i go wherever the fuhrer needs me
who knows why they chose me ?
but imagine if you did it !
you 'd be on the front page
UNknown heroes conquer last problem of the alps !
front page and no more making coffee
you 'r e skipping the UNknown ?
no way i know you
if you know so much you must have heard of
max UNknown and karl UNknown
we knew both of them two first class UNknown
on the death wall there 's sunshine one minute and a blizzard the next
or you get hit by an avalanche or a rock slide
you can be the best but it 's still a lottery
that 's why we 'r e skipping it
UNknown don 't forget the curfew
UNknown good luck see you around
we prefer cleaning UNknown these days
i want something i can be proud of too
and if they print my story
i do understand just find 2 other UNknown
you 'r e so stubborn
but i always waited for you in the end
look at this joke of a wall
hey UNknown how long are you going to be mad at me ?
how long are you going to be too coward to even try ?
you and i could be the first ones up there
that 's not what climbing is about
yes it is that 's exactly what it 's about
i want to prove to the world what i can do and who i am
i don 't have to prove anything to anyone
i imagined it much bigger
just imagine a man 's life hangs from this tiny thing
you UNknown e got to be very determined
they backed down right ?
how do you know ?
willy UNknown and UNknown UNknown are austrians but they 'r e party members
and apparently top notch UNknown
they 'r e camped at the foot of the UNknown
in the next few days
special leave until the end of july ?
don 't play me for a fool UNknown !
company sergeant the truth is
it 's for a wedding
you 'r e just what i needed UNknown
well then who is getting married ?
and private UNknown is to be my best man
why did you change your mind ?
because what i said wasn 't true
i don 't just climb for me
and someone has to watch out for you
that 's enough now we need 10 ice UNknown
UNknown ice axes UNknown short and long pick two times 30 metres of rope two static chords
there 's no h in UNknown
two gasoline UNknown a UNknown of gasoline a pack of UNknown and so on and so forth
plus another 15 for the train
we 'r e going by bike

the man in the photo department he
we should be there by tomorrow
the bride beautiful very beautiful just a little tall next to you
3 970 metres all rock and ice
love at first sight right ?
i 'm not so sure
the train goes straight through the mountain all the way up to the UNknown

four stars at over 2 000 metres !
i can see mountains on the riviera
UNknown UNknown UNknown UNknown 2 UNknown m

you have a magnificent room with a view of the north face
your wife will be delighted
too bad we 'r e just colleagues
i don 't suppose it 's that cozy down there
i UNknown l start a fire and cook dinner
you finish pitching the tent
are we married or something ?
you remind me of my mother
and that 's the spirit of the german conqueror UNknown in the battle against the mountain
bound together in life and death the climbing partners dream of ice and rock
the reader has to feel like he 's really there that 's what makes a good story
the german soldier dreams of when having fought to the summit the world shall lie at his feet and above him shall stretch the limitless sky
you adore richard wagner too
in any case with great photos no one reads the words anyway
did you see the french team 's iron ?
they won 't get as far as the UNknown UNknown
the UNknown don 't even have ice axes
we wondered where you were
after all this is a gathering of professionals
were you on the wall today ?
how high did you get picking mushrooms ?
would this be race specific ?
what does the austrian dream of ?
at least the aryans among you
i wouldn 't know if that also applies to you
i was talking about UNknown
now they are a breed of their own hm ?
aren 't you homesick for austria ?
UNknown can 't hold out much longer
when germany UNknown austria we UNknown l be home in the wink of an eye
and then we call the shots
i don 't know if i could take being exiled
did you see our iron ?
steel UNknown rope only the best and all paid for by the sa
what do you have to do in return ?
be the first ones at the top
the tunnel has a total length of 7 4 km
behind this wooden door is one of the galleries that opens out on the north face
from here UNknown rock was dumped straight into the abyss
we are now just shy of 3 000 metres above sea level
UNknown and UNknown started here and climbed straight upward
tedious it 's so steep you 'd need a UNknown every UNknown
i think we should climb UNknown
head for the gallery window
bivouac sacks ice UNknown food etc
UNknown UNknown 2 UNknown m
it goes down forever !
darling did you hear that ?
thanks i believe it already
that anyone would voluntarily go out there !
you UNknown e got to really want it

first ice field second ice field the UNknown the ramp the spider then a good exit crack to the summit ice field and hallelujah !
for crying out loud !

don 't you think so ?
do you know the legend of the giant ogre ?
what 's the guy 's name ?
the legend says the ogre lives in the mountain and UNknown everyone who gets too close
just a few rope lengths to the gallery window
no man has ever been up there
what are you doing at our entry point ?
what 's your problem UNknown ?
what did they say ?
it 's too risky for them
and the weather doesn 't look rosy either
UNknown UNknown mountain brigade retired
thought you didn 't care about the UNknown
who 's your partner ?
a full scale attack with a german team
i mean after you change your clothes
i suppose i could shave
your equipment must weigh a ton
we use a depot to save energy
just under the UNknown UNknown
but that 's nowhere near the UNknown route
we 'r e taking our own route
i don 't understand a thing
but i find it terribly adventurous
alright then here 's to adventure ladies and gentlemen
as long as a big pile of UNknown is all the german heroes are out to attack and conquer i don 't mind
pride mr UNknown pride is what this is about
the pride of facing a challenge whether it be in sports or politics
to this i raise my glass
i 'd iike to propose a toast too
that you all return safely
that 's the important thing
that 's what you wanted to say mr UNknown isn 't it ?
and now tell us how it was growing up together in the mountains
it 's great fodder for our story
just like the good old days they UNknown e always been cocky
i tagged along and made them teach me everything
can you imagine it ?
for example catching a trout with your bare hand
or how to pitch a tent
right later how to wind ropes how to drive UNknown into the wall
how to find the best hand and UNknown
where did you learn that ?
did you teach yourself ?
my piano teacher boxed my ears so i quit and just played in bars after that
won 't you stay a bit ?
it 's just starting to get fun
a true athlete hm ?
disciplined no loafing about am i right ?
we each make our own decisions in life
we each make our own decisions
one has to take risks
then life 's a game
i say let 's be reckless
rather than UNknown what good is that ?
that life brings we just need to be bold
we want to be gay to laugh act silly and daft
and it all works out in the end
take the bull by the horns don 't hesitate
for if you falter you rust
faster faster onward don 't wait
into the wild blue yonder or bust
it UNknown l get better you UNknown l see
you know what 's sad ?
we UNknown l always be deprived of the real dramas
what do you mean ?
we report on the UNknown at the UNknown beforehand
and perhaps on a successful UNknown afterwards
but what really takes place out there is something we can only guess at
i wish it were already over
i wish it would finally get underway
i wanted to tell you last night that i was a little tipsy
i 'd appreciate you looking after this
i can write my entry afterwards
everything i UNknown e ever done is in there
it would be a shame if it got lost
see you in a bit !
don 't make so much noise !
you UNknown l wake up the competition
saturday july 18 2 10 a m
we 'r e off to a good start hm ?
at least they 'r e showing us the way
we 'r e almost at the depot
if the storm didn 't take it
early this morning two fully equipped teams started up the wall
it 's ok i 'm fine
i thought that was you
you kicked the rocks loose
we have a different entry point
the UNknown route is more to the left
UNknown and UNknown started here climbed to here
here 's the window to the cog railway
they cross over here and enter the first ice field and hit the UNknown UNknown route climb up over the second ice field
what do you say to this beautiful weather ?
i doubt it will hold
the french and italian teams didn 't set out
if something happened up there would you rescue them ?
if he slips that 's an entire rope length
ah there they are !
i UNknown e got this covered
you make sure we have enough shots of the spectators
no sleeping get to work !
look show me i didn 't make a mistake with you !
get your own magic UNknown !
you need a UNknown every UNknown
yeah if you can even find a place to sink them
this is a lousy route
you could take a different one
no one is forcing you to stick to us like glue
we UNknown l UNknown this slab climb up the chimney and cross over the ice field
you can 't cross here !
you always say never say never
see you at the top
though i doubt you UNknown l make it
we UNknown l UNknown to a lower point and cross there
you UNknown l be famous for that
mind if we cross ?
the austrians are coming along too
maybe we should leave the rope here
are we a team now ?
then why did you let us over ?
so things wouldn 't get boring
in case we have to come back
now you 'r e being overly cautious
up there that 's the way to berlin
3 30 p m flrst ice UNknown 2 980 m
they austrians don 't have any either
what 's with those UNknown ?
have they given up already ?
toni it UNknown l be dark soon
let 's find a nice b b ?
flrst UNknown 3 100 m
we 'r e more than halfway
and ahead of them !
ladies and gentlemen the house presents this cake to celebrate the first UNknown of the UNknown north face
it won 't be long now
tomorrow the UNknown will be conquered today you can consume a piece of it
give me one of those darling UNknown please
you 'r e lucky madam
if it were at least an austrian
you don 't look good at all
it 's not a beauty contest
i just need a little sleep
did you take care of the film ?
yes it 's all on its way to berlin
see that 's how i like it
carved it out of the UNknown with the sweat of my own brow
being there when history is being written gives you the UNknown too
or am i wrong ?
and thanks to what ?
wake me if there 's an avalanche
and turn down the wind
we 'r e going back down
you just need to wake up
willy you need a doctor
you UNknown l never summit like that willy never
don 't ever say that again
what 's with you ?
have you lost your mind ?
i need to get up there
look the doctor is down there
wake up then you UNknown l see it too
11 15 a m second ice UNknown 3 150 m
that one is UNknown right ?
the guides say we can forget today
and at this pace they won 't make it tomorrow either
the weather isn 't changing
so no summit push today
c 'm on let 's have a drink
it must be karl and max things
how 's UNknown doing anyway ?
he 's not faking it that 's for sure
can you see anything ?
it looks like they 'r e one team now
but one is in bad shape
c 'm on wake up !
3 40 p m flat iron 3 350 m
quick tie a UNknown !
you should have taken your own route
we have to turn around
because he won 't make it to the top
if we don 't hurry he UNknown l bleed to death
i UNknown l rope him down alone
don 't be ridiculous you UNknown l never manage
it 's a good idea
it 's a very good idea
if we leave the two of them alone they UNknown l both die
alright then we UNknown l do it together
we UNknown l go up together
we UNknown l pull him up with us
this is screwed and we both know it
why did i listen to you ?
we should just leave you behind
it would serve you right willy
our only chance is over the summit
it beats going down here
we UNknown l cross over the west ridge and get help
we don 't know what awaits us up there and by the time we get down
he UNknown l be dead
we have to get to the top
we have to keep going
why did i listen to you ?
second UNknown 3 250 m
then pull him out of the meeting !
tell him the tables are turning
yes of course i UNknown l wait
listen i can 't keep it together
those two don 't care about the politics anyway
see you back in berlin
are we leaving too ?
yes it looks like it
shouldn 't we stay and report on what happens up there ?
i don 't want to UNknown you child but you either need a glorious triumph or a horrible tragedy
an UNknown retreat is nothing more than a few lines on page 3
there 's no need to stay for that
whoever said it 's faster going down !
in this storm they won 't have made much progress
do you think so ?
maybe i should postpone my departure
it might be worth it to stay
i 'm a reporter what do you expect ?
are you not also human ?
maybe my nose is wrong this time
UNknown UNknown 3 170 m
don 't fall asleep or you UNknown l freeze !
tuesday july 21 5 20 a m

you UNknown l catch your death of cold
there are people on the wall
they 'r e somewhere near the UNknown UNknown that 's 200 m away from here we 'r e almost on the east ridge here
they UNknown l never hear you in this wind
we 'd have to go over to gallery window 38
why can 't they hear us ?

it 's our only chance
who knows how far that is ?
we don 't have enough rope
if we don 't find a ledge we 'r e UNknown
if an avalanche comes we 'r e UNknown here too

what did he say ?
i didn 't quite catch it

but it might work in the crack
it 's taking too long
it UNknown l be night soon
no don 't go !

it 's a terrible tragedy
i UNknown l take you home
i UNknown l take you back to berlin
i 'm not going back to berlin
i 'm not going back
there are too many people like you there
all i know is that death spared me and that toni went away forever that day
one has lived if one has loved
there are times when i find this infinitely hard to believe
most days i feel that i am alive
and that love is the reason for that
the first UNknown of the UNknown north face took place in 1938
the german austrian climbing party followed toni UNknown and UNknown UNknown 's route
the nazis declared it an athletic symbol of the recent UNknown of austria into the german reich
no way UNknown UNknown 's ever coming back

could UNknown e been two dead today instead UNknown one
now you and i both know that randy had been drinkin
but we also know that he 's not at fault here
how do you explain the car that came out of nowhere ?
how do you explain UNknown or sock monkeys ?
been running through a UNknown
UNknown was low and my eyes stayed down
been sinking slowly into the mire
found UNknown in enemy fire
i 'm too young to be trapped by the wire
i can 't afford to dream on the UNknown
nothing 's left unseen on the UNknown
there once was a UNknown UNknown
UNknown was the most beautiful UNknown in the world
UNknown was discovered by a prince UNknown and the prince was led into a world UNknown and beautiful magic
why can 't i touch you ?
UNknown UNknown we 'i i explode
i just want sam back
you uh you want a smoke ?
i heard you signed the police report
ruining your life won 't bring sam back would it ?
you believe in spooky shit ?
i don 't not believe in them but i UNknown e never seen one
i said some pretty mean things to sam before she died
i think i 'm supposed to find billy UNknown
i don 't know but i saw him
and it 's like all i can think is it 's just guilt
what did he say ?
it 's like i was UNknown or something
i got this acid one time this flying eagle pyramid shit
i took two hits and
there was this glowing grid cutting through my brain and
you know i knew when it got all the way through that i 'd just be like this UNknown out vegetable
the whole time my UNknown was twisting and turning in my throat
i can slip back into it now and again
but that 's like a gift and a curse
cause that means you gotta figure out what 's real and what 's not
it 's like you have to decide
maybe this is all a nightmare and we UNknown l just wake up
i 'd do anything to take it all back just start over
that 's about as real as it gets
there 's gotta be some connection between what happened to sam and donnie
that was sam 's brother ?
she didn 't mention him to me
i told her about me about my brother
she never talked to anybody about it
what about her parents ?
UNknown UNknown she wasn 't enough UNknown to love
she told me she thought her brother was the lucky one
everyone would remember him and love him forever
li ke he had the easy way out
you bel UNknown i n second chances ?
you 'r e almost there
they won 't UNknown do UNknown want
this is your last chance
are you coming with me ?
what happened to you ?
you should UNknown e stayed longer
i want to get out of this place
i haven 't put it in yet
the motel guy came to the room this morning
i don 't give a damn
dude we can 't afford another day
i can 't do this
my dad doesn 't know we 'r e here
he doesn 't he doesn 't even really know that i exist
so what what now ?
maybe we get matching UNknown couple UNknown stamps
park here for a lifetime or so
or you can go and do something totally fucking amazing
i got my own plans
i UNknown e UNknown UNknown 'r e smiling
you UNknown 's easy when it 's faster
i still can 't guess whatyou 'r e after
it 's the color ofyour skin
your skin is black metallic
it 's the color ofyour skin
your skin is black metallic
your skin is black metallic
your skin is black metallic thunderclap
why did you show me this ?
will you do the same ?
we just got that in
i i 'm UNknown about corey
i understand that you don 't want to talk about it but i believe that everything happens for a reason and and i know that for every action
there is an equal and opposite reaction
i went to high school
then you know that everything is in constant motion
like right now the universe is UNknown
and we 'r e flying through space at millions of miles per hour like a spaceship
and eventually it 's just gonna grow so big that it UNknown l freeze and die and then nothing we do will matter at all
i believe everyone has something that they 'r e meant to do
potential or or or destiny
like i was destined to get my hands on that UNknown
and it turns out that that it 's not even a UNknown at all
it has this this metal in it that doesn 't even exist on the UNknown table
i think i think i 'm gonna call it UNknown
everything 's changing for me
i can see things that i only used to dream about
what happened UNknown arm ?
is there anything i can do ?
i can 't afford that
how ifl told you that god could UNknown the way
i don 't think so
you know he can find you too help jump UNknown future
i 'd like to UNknown
sometimes i like to just come in here and sit and just stare up at that screen and wait for god to show me his plan UNknown
look up there on that screen and try to visualize what you think god 's plan foryour life is
so what do you see for me ?
picture whatyou think god wants your life to be like
oh you can 't go back
i thought it was my turn
well ifyou want to be born again you have to forget the past
jeremy told UNknown were in prison
that 's not very important
is that UNknown found god ?
doyou know that everything in the universe everything is god 's will ?
you know it 's no coincidence that you 'r e here with me
let me put it UNknown wrist
j ust a friendly little reminder
you don 't know how special you are do you ?
do you know that god can change his mind too ?
we were supposed to raise money for the church today
we we were just talking
good thing sinners can repent right ?
i didn 't do anything
john my bracelet 's missing
on UNknown to the UNknown universe
they are often haunted by the experience in their dreams
many ofthem will not remember
give it back to me
why are you looking at me funny ?
why are you looking funny ?
what happened to you ?
grandma told me you would come
i don 't know your grandma
show me how to do it
sh show you what ?
you know they found your dog tags in the church
they said you burned it down
wh what 's that ?
how 'd you know his name ?
and don 't you worry
they UNknown l find him
it wasn 't my fault
you saw my brother 's bones ?
ifyou went up to that mine a day earlier might have found billy UNknown still alive
they say he probably suffered
he just left him there to die
they think UNknown did it ?
right up above the mine
he didn 't do it
my brother corey billy they 'r e dead
i didn 't tell you something before
we can 't change that
think it UNknown l ever get easier ?
i wish i could believe that
three hours 41 minutes and 35 seconds
that 's when the world will end
but he didn 't do it
i spoke with trudy myself
how UNknown accuse me !
i think it 's the nicest thing anyone 's ever done for me
well uh that 's just the beginning
i want you to come watch the fireworks with me tonight
it 's gonna be beautiful
you don 't want to miss it
i i really don 't know ifl 'm up for it
you shouldn 't be alone
why are we up here ?
i don 't wanna be up here
this is right where the fireworks will come up
it UNknown l be awesome

hello i was able in my career to have great UNknown
my mother was a great UNknown for me
she believed in me ? even ?? i have one thing to say
i 'm not a critic
i feel like i am your trusting voice
and hopefully the supporting voice
i would like to see you all be successful past this show
i have had a career for four decades
i want you guys to be able to have that regardless of whether it is american idol or the rest of your life
i have truly enjoyed this experience
one of the things that i truly am deep in my heart is a parent
in the sense UNknown is part of UNknown
i want very much for them to be able to leave here and have a life that is fulfilling for them
she wants the best for them
but remember you are in control
who will win your vote tonight ?
the competition starts now with brandon i think it helps to have a UNknown like diana ross
i have been exposed to a lot of different celebrities doing what i do for a living
diana is a different breed
she is you know the star to which a lot of stars are compared to
you know she is the original ? i like brandon very much
he said he grew up on
i recorded this song in the early days with the UNknown
all right real good that made me feel good
a UNknown telling me that i was good
i mean with the nerves yeah
go back to your center
you know go to your center
all right thank you ?
we are going all the way back to UNknown for this number one smash
with you can 't hurry love here is brandon rogers
i stand before i find a love to let me live again right now the only thing that keeps me hangin on when
i feel my strength it 's almost gone i remember mama said you can 't hurry love
brandon all right so this is the start of the future for everybody
everybody has to be in it to win it
UNknown you came out like you had UNknown back to a background singer for me
at the very end the last two notes of the song the last two notes of the song you sounded like you wanted to be in front
UNknown it has to be better than that for me man
it is not 's y to do what you are doing
especially the first night out here
nerves play a big part of it
going from a small round into a big concert hall like this
you know brandon we don 't need to tell you what you did wrong
there are many things that you do right
and i think that cheers and applause ? that was a complete
you came over if you don 't mind me saying as a background singer for a background singer
sorry brandon rogers taking a beating from the judging table right now
i tried to pick it up as best as i could ? this is the first time you guys have been on a stage like this in this competition
i think it is kind of amazing to be out here
the whole crowd cheering and everything
i got a little caught up in it
and i enjoyed it a little too much
nerves coming into play how about going first tonight ?
how did that affect you ? well i knew i had to bring it
apparently i didn 't do my best
i will try to do better next time if i 'm given the opportunity all right
you will have two hours at the end of the show to vote
give it up for brandon one more time
we are going to take a break
you vote for your favorite singer at the end of the show
but this season you can ask your favorite questions as well
click on my coke rewards
ask a question to an idol
UNknown is with me right now
how are you ? good
we have a question from georgia ?
what do you consider the hardest part of this contest ? wow
i would have to say the high heels and these dresses
i like my tennis shoes and my sweat pants
simon any advice on the high heels ? you should know ryan whoa !
let 's take a look at diana and UNknown in action
good luck baby thank you
i am an old school UNknown girl at heart
so people like diana ross are just huge to me i 'm such a big fan UNknown heard so much about you
when i sing home i think about my world changing ?
when she started to sing the words you believed it
i think the audience will feel
when you sing i get goose bumps i was excited about that ? whether she wins or not she will UNknown
i feel that will you believe in her too ?
all right check it out
i got to say i don 't know if it was my favorite performance of yours
but it was still really strong
so for that performance i give the girls one the boys zero
cheers and applause UNknown just watching you i feel what
you are feeling so much joy
i 'm so excited for you because
i mean this is it for you
this is it for you
you are so into this
cheers and applause simon ?
are you at a loss for words ?
what 's happening ? i 'm sneezing
i 'm not quite crying UNknown ?
me linda i mean you have even made
i have always thought that song was ?
you are making me laugh paula
you made a very boring song fantastic
you know who you remind me of ?
that dress is such a pain
right ? yes if you want to vote for UNknown
thank you very much UNknown
next it is chris my first impression of chris is that he was a little bit nervous i don 't really have the nervous bone in my body
i feel we have very similar hair
it is exciting yes we do i can 't get mine to go as much out like that you have to tease i UNknown l see what i can do
i will do endless love i think
and give it a different feel
see how you like it okay
when you listen to that sound it doesn 't sound extremely modern
i changed some of the UNknown around can i give you one comment ? yes please the music is about going to the heart
with endless love it is important to find the melody and hold on to it
chris needs to listen more to the melody of the song and find that hook
that is the thing that will sell this song
and it will sell him
can he make this song his own ?
you will always be my endless love oh cheers and applause
chris what 's up baby ?
dude i have to tell you man the bad part of that for me ? it was a weird thing to do to that song
because like the melody changed everywhere
but you have to not worry about the style and sing your heart out
you have a good voice
but that was a mess for me
well that song is so UNknown and it is such a beautiful love song
and sometimes i worry that you are trying UNknown hard to be UNknown hip and cool
and sometimes you can just let the melody play
you have a nice voice
i would worry less about fitting into some kind of contemporary thing
you turned a beautiful song into a complete and utter UNknown
i found it completely ?
i thought it was just the booth ? UNknown UNknown
and i would keep your glasses on
i think it is you chris UNknown
did you ever think you would be on a stage singing a diana ross song ? no never when you were a
little boy huh ? no
i have a lot of respect for diana ross
i went with my gut
you know i felt like it was a good arrangement
but obviously you know the judges and i have different opinions ?
it had a lot more to do with the arrangement of the song than it did the vocal
but i mean obviously that is part of the whole thing
so hopefully next week ly come back and try to do something that is arranged a
thank you very much chris
chris UNknown ladies and gentlemen ?
when we come back we have gina live back with the idol
we are live and celebrating the music of diana ross
one person leaves us live tomorrow
remember it is your call that counts
next up is a star struck gina
great to meet you when i first walked in the room ? it was so crazy
i 'm going to sing love child
i have a story about this song
when i was like four years old my parents have a UNknown of me singing
they were like you know what this song is about ? gina to me has incredible vocal ability
the things i wanted to remind her of was UNknown
there are so many words
you must UNknown everything okay she told me the song was a story
don 't leave any words out
don 't die out on the phrases
? you know what i mean ?
you have to project i will definitely take ms
ross 's advice and run with it i wish you well
i do thank you so much ?
another number one for diana with the UNknown back in UNknown
here is gina singing love child
you think that i don 't feel
love what i feel for you is real love in other 's eyes i see reflected a hurt scorned rejected
love child never meant to be
love child born in poverty
love child never meant to be
love child never meant to be
love child different than the rest
love child never quite as good afraid ashamed misunderstood but i UNknown l always love you
i UNknown l always love you
i UNknown l always love you
i UNknown l always love you
love child thank you !
all right so once again for me i might be saying this a lot tonight
i wasn 't my favorite performance from you
i 'm a gina fan
it was UNknown in spots
i didn 't feel the excitement from you with that song
it felt very boring to me
you know what i mean ?
it was weird well it is such an exciting song
i mean that song is like a feel good you can 't help yourself you want to get up
i feel that you are much better than how you did tonight
i feel like at times you were shouting and UNknown and pitch were kind of off okay gee marks the it was okay
you actually can 't say much about really
i think you chose the right song for you
it is good that you stayed in this image again
but it is a little bit UNknown
that 's why i 'm saying there is not much to say about it really
how did you feel on the stage tonight ? it is all good
the first time i 'm on a huge stage
i still feel feel at home on the stage ? bigger if you want to vote for gina
good luck okay ? thank you coming up UNknown UNknown has a mountain to climb
we are back on american idol
what will the top twelve deliver tonight ?
next up it is UNknown UNknown to me is love
give me a hug being able to have diana ross if UNknown you it is
like having van gogh teach you how to paint
ain 't no mountain high he started this song right off the bat without any bars to set it up stop
if you are going to do it like that you will have to be really point on
i didn 't feel that he was on the beat ?
at the beginning you were just do you tap your feet or anything is i just need to move around and like have fun
just feel it in my body you better get your soul in there
there is something in his spirit that is the winning ingredient
this was diana 's first u s
number one as a solo artist
what 's going down dude ?
i am really i don 't even know what to say man
i 'm like dude it wasn 't very good
it really wasn 't man
listen thank god for the background singers
because that song was almost UNknown for me man
it was really really weak
you know what i love about you ?
every week you throwing down some different UNknown with the hair
the hair is rockin though
hair idol off got it
you know what i mean ? ?
i understand what diana said
it wasn 't that you sang on pitch i understand what diana was saying
you have to start it off you have to grab the audience
and when a song like that happens you have to let go
that is the thing you have to explode with your UNknown now
you look adorable though the hair is popular ? look when you hear a whale in beverly hills that is where diana ross is watching this show what ?
she is going to freak when she hears that
the only similarity is the UNknown
i don 't know what else to say
i mean it was crowd boo i will be positive
how old are you ? 17 you are very brave
i UNknown l give you that you are brave
the courage of UNknown UNknown
i think we are dying to know what 's going on in your head when you are listening to them give you UNknown tonight i don 't know
i mean i listen to the positive things
your first comment i have no idea what you were talking about
what i was trying to say was when she listens to this on tv she will scream he wasn 't talking about the marine biology aspect of
do you feel like you should be here next week ? yeah if you do at home as well UNknown 's number ? ? ?
when we come back it is haley
back with you on american idol
we are all about diana ross tonight
live right here on idol
and another viewer question okay this is from nicole rice in texas
where is the craziest blaze you ever sang ? you know it has to be here
this night is so intense
like we are back stage and we are freaking out
i remember like when i first set foot on stage that will always stay true to my heart
nothing will ever compare to this it is pretty intense
the waiting room back there is anybody speaking ? yeah
we are just like we are like this you know
we are like cold and drinking water ?
there is always coca cola available
take a look at your master class ? how are you ? i 'm good ? you really are good i 'm sing missing you
i thought it would show more emotion
ooh i 'm missing you she has a recording studio voice as compared to a live audience projection
we were broken hearted about his death
good to have thoughts behind the songs
i think the audience reads that and feels that my goal tonight is definitely to enjoy the song and sing every word and truly mean the words
because the lyrics were beautiful
and to have fun and not stress out about the little things
kind of have fun out there
let 's hope it is fun for you too
i cried so many tears gotta face now all my fears we let time slip away i need you boy here to today
i 'm missing you tell me why tell me why the road turns
how are you haley ?
well listen i mean you gave it a valiant effort
you know forgetting the words and stuff i think you UNknown a little nervous when you started
you know it was all UNknown and all over the place
usually your pitch is better than
that just a little surprised
a little shocked well i UNknown l start with saying you look lovely tonight
cheers and applause but you know that is probably not what you want to hear so far
again the same thing ? forgetting the words is never a great thing to do
and your pitch you are so adorable
you know this is hard
this is a hard thing
you know to give you credit haley i think we will remember you now
i think you looked like a star
your nerves got the best of you halfway through the song
but if you can just hold it together you may do better than i thought you were going to do
i 'm very impressed with your presence on stage tonight
there were moments of your UNknown i liked it
then we will reset sure how do you feel right now ?
a little relieved i feel like i 'm going like this if you would like a stool there is one right there
if you would like to vote for haley that 's good
you should feel good i messed up my words
i feel like such a UNknown
you know it is what it is
but simon and everybody it means so much to get a good
something good from you guys
i feel like this is like the worst performance just because
i messed up my words
it truly means so much to me half the time the audience never knows you have messed up
if you want to vote for haley ? or ?
good luck thank you ? we will disappear for a few moments
back with you on american idol
halfway through the most emotional show to date
wouldn 't you agree ? absolutely
i do agree tears excitement good performances ?
i would ask you more but we have to keep moving ?
good to have you with us
we have a great audience
now it is time for phil stacey
take it away phil i 'm phil stacey
how are you doing ? i 'm fine such an honor to meet you today
when i met diana ross i didn 't have much of a game plan
i wanted to get the song right ?
i like the song he selected
it is a song i did with marvin UNknown
he brought back memories for me
one of the things i have had an issue with is gathering myself and getting in the right mind set before i go out on stage
i asked for her advice you know what i think helped me is looking at the audience
with the same feelings like you have and everything thank you so much ms
ross you are welcome this week i 'm going to start a lot differently
and a lot more confident he is confident
will he make you love him ?
ladies and gentlemen phil stacey
i 'm gone action do all the things for you a girl wants a man to do oh baby
i UNknown l sacrifice for you
i 'm going to make you love me oh yes i will yes i will
i 'm gonna make you love me oh yes i will yes i will my love is strong you see
i know you UNknown l never get tired of me oh baby every night and every day
i 'm gonna say i 'm gonna get you
look out girl i 'm gonna get you
i 'm gonna make you love me yes i will
i 'm gonna make you love me yes ly yes i will
phil what 's up baby ?
you glad that is over ?
listen i will tell you the positive thing for you man
it was the performance the performance was a little boring
you get the boy award for the night man
you were on blast man
i love that yeah we were discussing that while you were performing
your UNknown sound really good
that song we were feeling a need to be more up tempo
it would have been more exciting
other than that though phil you have strong UNknown
i think you were wrong paula
that shouldn 't be an up tempo song
he chose the right tempo should have more tempo to it whatever
i think it was a very good choice of song for you
you have a tendency though that when you are trying to hit the big notes you shout
so it is like you are shouting in my ear
somehow you have to control that
again it was somewhere in the middle
it was better than last week though ? i thought it was really good
it was good take that man
if you want to vote for phil ? ? ??
thank you very much phil
we are coming back live with UNknown
hang on back with you live on idol
i never looked at the lyrics until last night it is a billie holliday song
she wrote it while on tour or when i did the movie lady sings the blues that is how we had the song in the film
because of this song you know what it is billie holliday and all of
that wear something long and simple would you suggest having a UNknown stand or not having a UNknown stand ?
? ? you can bring them to you
it says to me she is thinking about how she should perform it thank you so much
i am looking forward to seeing what UNknown decides to do
just make sure you call at the end of the show
they are yelling for UNknown
UNknown is in the house
per UNknown song choice for you
you didn 't overdo it
you could have easily done
that you have a big old voice
you are a beautiful performer
you are a beautiful girl
and your heart comes through when you sing
that is the most important thing you can possess as an artist
UNknown you have either got it or you haven 't got it
you UNknown e got it
i mean there is the difference
i have to say the quality difference between you and UNknown compared to the other singers we have heard so far you two are in a different league
i totally agree with randy
it was a very controlled performance
you didn 't look UNknown by this big stage or the big orchestra
you were very much in control
that is what we want to hear UNknown
i know you feel good after that
simon says that you UNknown e got it
do you feel like you are comfortable with it i 'm getting it
i 'm getting it how did you feel inside when you were singing that ? a little nervous
a little bit you didn 't show it sing
i 'm used to singing so loud and so big
i wanted to tone it down a bit good control tonight
1 ? tax ? ? thank you coming up we have a modern spin on a UNknown classic
blake lewis is on after the break
welcome back to american idol live
blake lewis ladies and gentlemen in the house
it has to be michael jackson got it anyone that can perform really well hopefully that is you tonight performing very well
i slowed it down and made it my own
set me free why don 't ya babe
blake was doing a song that
i did in the 60 's and he was bringing it from the 60 's to today
and you need to make it fresh
i definitely hope she sees that i took her piece from the 60 's and now it is UNknown
that i just UNknown it and i hope she really likes it
this song is so popular
it has been UNknown into the UNknown hall of fame
with you keep me hangin on here is blake
you don 't really love me you just keep me hangin on cheers and applause
all right check it out UNknown
UNknown there were some good things about it
i mean you know classic songs like this you don 't necessarily have to change the arrangement
you don 't have to worry about blake UNknown every song
you like that word right ?
you actually sing better than
that let the UNknown do your thing
you are a great performer
you are modern hip cool
let the classics be the classics
you know what i mean ? i understand what you are saying totally
i think you could have a hit with that again
i do you have to put more UNknown in it
there wasn 't enough of you
you sing better than that you are a real good singer too you are a real good singer too you can work it out i didn 't get that blake
i didn 't get it at all
i understand why you wanted to put your own take on it
but if you had heard that in isolation if you heard that version as we heard that on the radio you wouldn 't like it
because that song was written in a particular style
it didn 't work changing the melody like that
you didn 't sound as good as we have heard you either the classics don 't need changing most time you don 't need to change anything
we love UNknown sounds you will be fine blake
you regret changing it so much ? no not at all
i wanted to put my feel to it
you know maybe a little more electronic UNknown to it did you get what they are saying about the UNknown though ?
good luck thank you three more coming up
stephanie edwards and chris richardson on after this welcome back to american idol
live results tomorrow night put it in your pocket you realize this is a live UNknown
right ? lots of drama tomorrow
like there is not enough tonight
i am in love with diana ross my notes with stephanie had to do with the song being delivered with a sexy quality
she is diana ross she is a tiny little thing
reminded me so much of me when
i think she has star quality i 'm really excited to take her advice and do it
hopefully she is watching and she is like that 's my girl
i 'm proud this one turned into diana into the UNknown UNknown
with love hangover here is stephanie
if there 's a cure for this
i don 't want it
i don 't want it if there 's a cure for this i don 't want it i don 't want it think about it all the time
i never let it out of my mind
i don 't want a cure for this
i don 't want a cure for this
i don 't want a cure
cause you are in my heart in my head and i just can 't get out of the bed baby i don 't wanna get over the sweetest hangover
i don 't wanna i don 't wanna get i don 't wanna get over
all right it 's an an interesting night
it was a good vocal
i don 't think it was your best vocal
the perfect choice for you
i was waiting for the up tempo part to start
we all love that song
was there an artistic choice ? it was just longer
kind of too long to put it in that is what arranging is for
you know strive for better
you have a beautiful voice thank you it was a very strange arrangement of the song
you teased everybody with the good part
basically what you sang was an UNknown
it didn 't close particularly well
i think you were completely UNknown by UNknown and UNknown tonight
it wasn 't your best performance
and you had a multitude of amazing diana ross songs to choose
from and you chose in my opinion the wrong song
and you are going to have to make a much bigger impact at this stage of the competition stephanie stephanie edwards
so the arrangement how much control do you have over that ?
you have a lot of control over it
it is just that once it got to the whole UNknown part of the song it was kind of like a
lot of music and just ad UNknown
i wanted to sing the verses and the melody of the song let 's see if you get a shot to do something next week
to arrange another one 10 good luck to you stephanie thank you all right next what advice did diana have for chris ? hello
glad to meet you you too i 'm going to sing you don 't have to be nervous around me
i 'm no different than you
you need to work the song
are you going to work the audience ? i hope so ; ? he has to move around a bit on that song
in other words move around to sell the song to the audience
anyway it sounds really good
keep your head in a good place thank you so much
? let 's see if he can work it singing the boss
i was so sure so sure but
love taught me who was the boss
i defy anyone who says that i ?
so right why should i feel so UNknown so ?
love did show me one thing oh that love taught me who was the boss cheers and applause
i tell you what ? i mean it wasn 't my favorite performance of yours
you overdid it a little bit ?
the words you did connect on were hot
you know you know it was interesting for me
kind of half and half
half good half bad for me
i think out of all the guys you nailed the blend of bringing contemporary into
there were songs back in the day that it was one of the best dance songs
you turned in that direction
you did a great job
chris remembering this is a singing competition take you out of the UNknown with your charm and personality
once again if you heard that record in isolation on the radio you would switch to the nearest channel instantly
we will open the lines in a bit
thank you very much coming up next we are closing the show with UNknown after the break
it is the last number before we open the lines
what was the chemistry like between diana and UNknown ?
this week i 'm going to be showing my softer side by singing if we hold on together
i think UNknown is absolutely gorgeous
but you need to be able to project a song you have to
look at the audience and really believe and own the words of the song
don 't lose your way
through the song thank you
and to me she has star quality
because of her smile and you see the glitter the shine in her eyes
so she has an inner light
which is very important this song was featured in
with if we hold on together here is UNknown
i tell you what i have been a fan since day one ?
i 'm saying it i 'm impress with you mean a lot of people think this is a two girl race on the girls 's UNknown
tonight with that you just made it a three girl race
as i have said before you are a natural gift
you are like a breath of fresh air
you can sing your little heart out
i wasn 't that familiar with that song
but it doesn 't matter
because you drew me in right away thank you
you know what i mean
having said that i agree with what the guys said
i mean randy said it best with the word impressive
the lines are going to open in a moment
here are all the performances and numbers one more time

phil stacey took on the same UNknown with UNknown UNknown

ryan you are silly simon didn 't extend any kindness to UNknown after he UNknown pearl jam
jeremy very indulgent choice of song

jeremy 's spoke in class today try to forgive them try to forget them try to erase it from the blackboard
jeremy spoke in class today

we made this for you and the other three who so nearly made it
watch this when i came out of the room
i knew at that point my whole
life could change instantly i was thrilled when they said you are going to hollywood
i grabbed that ticket this experience has changed my whole life
it is hard for me to put into words american idol right now is my one shot
i 'm going home to the place where i belong probably one of best voices we have heard
i 'm going to be amazed if you don 't make the finals welcome to hollywood thank you
going to hollywood ! i just want to make it really bad
you ready for the truth ?
this is a big shot for me
i 'm blessed to be here i will never ever have an opportunity like this again in life ? i have come such a long way
it is hard to fathom sometimes
i 'm going home ? see you then we will miss them
take a look at these faces
we will be back with a live two hour special tuesday celebrating the music of diana ross
thanks to UNknown and the band ?
well the girls ripped it up
the guys threw it down
but four more cuts must be made
welcome to the show you control
let 's see what you have done with it
tonight four more contestants will perform for the final time as we get closer to revealing your top 12
we hate to see them go
we have a great show to help ease the pain
later in the program the american idol challenge
you could be here in this audience with a very nice chunk of change
on this very stage in a few singing live UNknown UNknown
that is pretty cool UNknown
and right now in those three chairs are american idol judges
a big thank you to everyone who called in
over 32 million votes came in
let us look at what you are voting for
this week the top ten guys and top ten girls took the stage for a second chance to win your votes
some stayed true to their roots
nick stuck with a standard
and blake beat boxed it is so good to hear you return to form UNknown
i like you man feeling good
feeling good and apparently so was a j
UNknown simon was feeling the same you absolutely i think did the right thing
you came out and you have made yourself different
you made yourself stand out UNknown i took a risk
and it worked unfortunately in the judges eye it didn 't work for everyone
that was really weak when it was brandon 's turn simon was annoyed by something other than his singing
UNknown it is my dad 's birthday by the way it is my mum 's birthday in november
happy birthday mum in six months time
i like puppies UNknown UNknown wanted some love too
i thought to be honest with you when we put you through you were more edgy than this UNknown
she is not dressed edgy gina wasn 't the only person mr
fashion police was going to pull over
can i be honest with you ? yes i don 't like the outfit tonight
i found it distracting do take fashion advice from simon leslie went UNknown with nina simone
that bit at end the you sounded like paula talking oh what ?
others were keen to keep it contemporary
UNknown went for a country twist
it was a mess for me
it was all over the place UNknown can 't win with them UNknown couldn 't win either
but she was ready to fire back i thought you were worse than last week simon was wrong about jennifer hudson
so hopefully let me be clear okay ?
we put jennifer hudson in american idol
the american audience voted her out
okay ? whitney houston was again a popular choice
queen of the night i think you are one of two or three very vulnerable girls tonight
but it was UNknown 's funny valentine that finally got simon to show the love
the best vocal we have had through the competition
and it was a fantastic performance
however it is the love that you give america that really counts
how did those votes go down ?
i 'd throw away the cars and the bars and the wars and make sweet love to you yes i 'd make sweet love to you
joy to the world all the boys and girls joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea joy to you and me you know i love the ladies

keep it on fox for an all new
are you smarter than a fifth UNknown UNknown
??? ??? one last chance
who will you send into the top 12 ?
the drama is about to begin
and we don 't have paula right now
welcome to a second installment of american idol this week
we are live and ready for eight dazzling performances
as the girls pull out all the stops to win your votes
say hello to UNknown sparks sabrina sloan UNknown UNknown haley UNknown stephanie edwards
UNknown jones gina UNknown and UNknown doolittle
only six of them will make it through
tomorrow we announce the top 12
plus details on our most important and probably most ground breaking idol project to date
say hello to the gentlemen
keep it up for the judges
randy jackson paula abdul has made it !
she was under the desk
she had to get something for me
did i mention this show is live ?
simon last night 's show was live
the girls have chosen some great music tonight
we have mary j ??? some whitney and we start with pat UNknown from UNknown sparks
let 's do it ???
on the weekends nobody ever sees me because i 'm out supporting my team
i put the face paint on and everything
there was actually a time in my life where i wanted to play football
it was up there with singing but not quite
you know what 's crazy ?
this is so weird for me
it is like a different show when the girls come in
way to start out the night
i mean it wasn 't your best performance
there were a couple of UNknown spots
it was still better than all the boys last night
i 'm like what 's going on !
it is girls time baby
the energy that you brought to this stage today i just think you are getting better and better each week
you were exploding coming into your own UNknown
it is unbelievable i think you will be here for a long long long time
i 'm not quite as enthusiastic about this
i thought it was a bit UNknown in the middle
let you know what ? listen
i think you will 100 be here next week
i don 't think it was your strongest performance we have seen out of the last three weeks ok thank you
you can feel that top 12
how excited are you this week ?
very i can hardly contain myself
you will have two hours to vote at the end of the show
i don 't notice anything
appreciate it way to kick it off
we UNknown l be right back with sabrina and UNknown live
back with you live on idol
eight girls fighting for six places in the top 12
those results coming to you live tomorrow night
plus an appearance by carrie underwood
she will be with us
gina and sabrina with me right now
so the girls have been getting a lot of praise as a group
is that a blessing or a curse ?
i think it is a blessing
i believe that all of us together we feed off of each other 's energy and talent
for every single one of us it is getting higher and higher
has it made it easier for you ?
we are all nervous tonight
we know what 's at stake
the best thing we can do is sing well and have fun
and you know leave the rest up to god and america
we will give you a shot to do that right now
let 's see what you have been keeping from us ???
when i was in high school i wanted to be the next katie UNknown
monday 's pep rally kicked off a sensational week of spirit
i UNknown our weekly high school television show ???
and i was the anchor i would go around
i had fun interviewing everyone on campus
i 'm really glad i had the singing thing going
??? don 't you wanna be more than friends hold me tight and don 't let go don 't let go you got the right don 't let go
look sabrina i don 't know if this was my favorite performance from you
it was a solid performance
i 'm not sure i loved the song choice
you did your thing i mean you pick songs you show your big voice you have that
i wish that song had more melody for me
it was a good solid performance from you
for me there was one thing that is consistent
you can sing sing sing gorgeous
it UNknown through you have an amazing instrument
sabrina you are a great singer
i think i know where randy is coming from here
because it is lacking the emotion i see from your main competitors which are UNknown UNknown stephanie
for me it was a little bit UNknown
i have to say particularly because of the choice of song it actually reminded me of a hotel resort performance
i 'm not saying you are not a great singer
somehow you have to UNknown personality because without personality you will only go so far with your voice
we have to start believing you a little bit now
it is all too mechanical for me
if you are performing at any hotel i will go there ???
i have been playing the violin since i was four years old
i played all the way through high school
but since i have been in college i haven 't had the time to practice
so i 'm a little rusty
i still take lessons when i come home for summers
all right that was a pretty good song choice
i mean that was a cool song cool song
it was a nice ending you did
but it was a little UNknown in the middle there
i just always feel like the last couple of weeks that you don 't quite believe you are a better singer than you have shown
it is another okay performance for me
i think it was the right song choice for you
and where you stand right now with your range
bottom notes kind of have to watch out for
when you hit into the higher range ???
you have gone as far as you can go UNknown
the reality is and i think you know this yourself which is you are surrounded by some pretty amazing girl singers
i don 't know how much more you can do to be honest with you
i don 't think your voice is going to get any better
you know i feel for you because you have taken a lot of stuff in the media
you have handled yourself throughout ???
i 'm not going to UNknown you here
it wasn 't your worst
we have heard you sound worse
UNknown UNknown ladies and gentlemen
i mean i think i know i 'm surrounded by talented people
i think i have a different style than them
i 'm not trying to compare myself to anybody else
i wish the judges wouldn 't compare me to anyone else
i try to be myself
do you understand what simon is saying or not ?
i understand that yeah i 'm not going to doubt the talent
i think everyone is an amazing singer here
but i don 't try to be like them
we are all different we are all unique
i mean you know no one is being critical for the sake of being critical it is a fact
it is a singing competition only
let 's get to a warmer place
let 's shift gears right ?
we will take a break
when we come back we have haley and stephanie live
this is the number one show in the country
your votes can change lives
on stage next it is haley
when i was younger i was a UNknown
i started at the age of five
i continued on for ten years
i loved it it was a lot of fun ???
i UNknown my shoulder and then the other shoulder
then my body was through it was time to quit
then i turned to singing
i found out it was my true love and passion here i am
damn these old wheels rollin too slow
well all right a very interesting song choice for me at this part of the competition
but i guess you know that is kind of who you are
that is probably why you chose it right ?
i wasn 't jumping up and down
the performance was cool pretty much in tune
it needs some yo in it
you know what i 'm saying
that is a difficult UNknown to hear
but it is i think the kind of artist that you are
i mean that is the song you sing well
i mean it is not our favorite song
that is a good thing
i thought it was like something terrible ghastly high school musical performance
i will tell you the problem ???
i don 't know your name i genuinely don 't
you haven 't made an impression on this competition
i don 't think that performance helped at all
you almost take it personally don 't you ?
but every week i have gotten bad comments
so you just kind of do what you have to do
clock in and clock out
i 'm UNknown in doing my job
i 'm going to clock out right after i walk off this stage
haley you haven 't always gotten bad comments
not from everybody but simon doesn 't like me
i don 't think that is the best performance ???
paula what do you think her chances are ? ???
i think it is tough with the girls
it is anyone 's game up there right now
the phone number for haley
the big big week thank you very much good luck
up next it is stephanie
i have been singing since i was three years old
and i was only singing for my parents
whenever my parents asked me to sing at a UNknown or barbecue
i was so shy i would run in the room and cry
i think people will find that pretty weird
now i 'm confident and comfortable on stage
and it is just weird because i used to be really shy
i will love you anyway even if you cannot stay i think you are the one for me here is where you ought to be
i just want to satisfy you you 'r e not mine and i can 't deny it don 't you hear me talkin baby
love me now or i UNknown l go crazy
you 'r e my sweet thing sweet thing
i UNknown l give you an a for a valiant effort
it is always hard for me though when you started the song i 'm hearing shock in my head
i can 't help it
it is not supposed to be compared to that ???
it was okay for me really
there were some UNknown problems in there
i can 't quite get with it
i thought you were darn near flawless
i think you have to watch a little bit slightly falling behind in the music
staying on top of the beat
but you have a beautiful voice
and you have great UNknown
and you can manage it on stage
you did a great job thank you so much
stephanie no question you are one of the best we UNknown e got ???
you have a tendency to go a little bit copy cat
we are trying to find your UNknown here
but for me you have 100 done enough to get into the final 12 next week
does she have that ?
i 'm saying pick some songs that you won 't be
you don 't have to sing UNknown i know you love it ???
you know what i 'm saying
don 't call until after the show
welcome back to the show
the girls on a mission to make it into the top 12
you ready to bring that on ?
it is time for you
can i get a hug from you ?
i have laid it on you all right
the crazy thing about me is that i 'm terrified of animals
when i was younger i had a doberman UNknown and a poodle
i used to hide behind the doors
whenever i go over somebody 's house i 'm always asking them do you have animals ?
put them away because i will be on the table or couch
share my life take me for what i am cause i UNknown l never change all my colors for you i don 't really need to look very much further
i don 't know if it was your best performance
you have already made us love you
you don 't have to run anywhere
you are going to stay right here
i would never have known
what we haven 't seen tonight that you brought passion talent UNknown
and of course the yo factor
and just picking up on what i mentioned last week about the outfit UNknown
UNknown they need a show
they need their own show
oh my god i told them don 't act up
well they are clearly listening to you
thank you very much UNknown great job
carrie underwood will be here
what 's going on with you ?
all right i 'm a little nervous
thank you for reminding me
everything you have always wanted
and more for the past four years
i would like to share with you a couple of my lucky charms
yes i do rely a lot on luck on this show
he is always in my pocket
this is my pillow from my niece and nephews
i don 't travel without it
don 't lie to me just get your things
so finally finally the real gina comes out tonight
there were some pitch problems in it
you had a couple of things going on ???
this is who i thought you were
coming out ??? i love
that keep the edge alive
this is more or less who i imagined you to be
i know it gets exciting with the band and everything
because you will fall flat a little bit
you enjoyed that didn 't you ?
i can see you know what ?
i genuinely didn 't know who you were last week
this was the girl we wanted in this stage of the competition
picking up on what randy and paula said i think you tended to scream the song
but actually i really really hope you make it through next week
because you are honestly you are a breath of fresh air
by choosing better more UNknown songs you could do well
i hope the song wasn 't too extreme for you for the audience
that is the simon i love
a lot of fun to have you on the show
what was different for you this week ? ???
i think what i needed to hear was simon saying where is the edgy girl
this is what i wear at home
this is what i 'm comfortable in
i 'm stumbling on my words
i got a comment from simon UNknown
i 'm comfortable this is my kind of music
i rock out with the band great job guys
don 't do anything until we open up the lines in a bit
our final performance of the night live
your ready for UNknown ?
i do some UNknown things
some of my friends like to call it UNknown
i like to think of it as equal opportunity
you see like if i chew a certain amount on one side i have to do it on the other side
if i step on a crack with one foot i need to do it with the other foot ???
i mean it is all about equality
we are all in this together right ?
i can wash out forty four pairs of socks and have them hangin on the line
lay down at five jump up at six and start all over again because i 'm a woman
i don 't think they heard me that time woman woman you better believe i 'm a woman yeah
all right check it out
they are all jumping up and down
they are clapping for you because the hottest one of the night you deserve it ??? ???
you are ready to go in the studio and make a record man you got it going on ???

thank you UNknown and the band
results live tomorrow at 8 00 7 00 central
this is the beginning of a myth
one of thousands of UNknown families who endured atlantic UNknown to find a new life
for them europe was rotten and UNknown
america was from the beginning the finest country in the world
these new americans tamed and claimed the land for themselves
they demanded and with their sweat secured the right to worship their own gods and make themselves their own masters
and still today the UNknown the strong man stands against the horizon the UNknown still UNknown his family against impossible odds
the space and simplicity of the myth have become confused and UNknown in a million films records songs and stories
to fight like a man to die like a man is part of the myth
but the myth UNknown the UNknown reality of violent death
the western hero has simple religious beliefs
he is truthful and brave
just the same he 's a killer
johnny cash is a folk singer who can reach out to his audience and become the western hero before their eyes
ln this film he sings to an audience many of whom have known violence at first hand
not UNknown as in the myths of the golden west but real dangerous and bringing retribution
they are the inmates of one of the toughest prisons in america
san quentin in california where the wagons stopped
the past and the present come together when johnny cash enters this jail
who UNknown e you got there ?
i UNknown e got john with me
all right come on in
you better not bend over there at that camera light
man you 'r e in the wrong place to bend over don 't you know it ?
i UNknown e heard fellas say that they were terrified about coming into san quentin
i had some fella say the minute he walked in he was scared to death
everybody 's playing their own little game trying to get out of this madhouse i 'd call it actually
they 'r e family men they have wives and kids in a lot of cases and they UNknown e come here for some such crime or something like that
but mostly they 'r e not unlike the average guy on the streets with the exception of being inside
first week i was here there were something like three or four killings and the strangest thing about it i just heard about it
haven 't seen them just heard about UNknown m
matter of fact there was one incident that happened right in front of my cell and i didn 't know anything about it until i went to the chow hall
but we walked about it 's about a three four minute walk
i got to the chow hall and sat down a fella came up and says
you heard about that fella got hit with a two by four ?
i said UNknown here ?
right in front of your cell
and you move every time a bell rings it means something
you can do too much time it makes you UNknown where you can 't think for yourself
i can remember the times there were you know if i saw somebody stabbed or saw somebody hurt or something like that where it would bother me
i 'm getting to the point now where it almost doesn 't concern me
laughter in here is a gift lf you can laugh in here then you can make it
say man when are you going back to florida ?
ain 't you worried about getting your nourishment in this rotten place ?
well i don 't care if i do die do die
i 'd like to ask my wife
we 'r e gonna do that song right now
all right we UNknown e got another one
johnny cash represents a part of america that a lot of people want to look back to
it wasn 't a chaotic thing you know in their mind
it was mom 's apple pie and
it might have been beans but everybody had a full belly
you know things of this nature
that 's the only actual hero i really had
they 'r e hiding us you know ?
that society out there has created a good many of us
i myself feel that the greatest crime a UNknown portion of us in san quentin are guilty of is one thing that we were born poor
being a convict in california especially you know you 'r e not even allowed to fight for your country
we 'r e exposed to a kind of a machine like justice here which just UNknown us out you know because of our UNknown maybe
you know and you know shame on you if you put your hand on her leg or do something really out of line like that you know
they really get upset you know
you sit there and talk for about a half hour or something and for me it 's kinda
i seem to kind of get in a state of UNknown it 's like unreal
it takes a lot of imagination sometimes to write a song and to really put something in so that somebody else can feel it
we UNknown e been in several prisons san quentin and UNknown prison and the UNknown mississippi jail
you wouldn 't believe it one night i got in jail in UNknown for picking flowers
excuse me i couldn 't hear you i was talking
i was walking down the street you know going to get some cigarettes or something about two o UNknown lock in the morning after a show i think it was
anyway i reached down to pick a UNknown here and a daisy there as i went along and this car pulls up
get in here boy what are you doing ?
said 'i m just picking flowers
you can 't hardly win can you ?
god damn no telling what they UNknown l do if you pull an apple
lf any of the guards are still speaking to me could i have a glass of water ?
san quentin just for you
san quentin you been livin hell to me
you UNknown e UNknown me since UNknown
i UNknown e seen UNknown m come and go and i UNknown e seen UNknown m die
and long ago i stopped askin why
san quentin i hate every inch of you
you UNknown e cut me and have scarred me through and through
and i walked out a wiser weaker man
mr congressman you can 't understand
san quentin what good do you think you do ?
do you think i UNknown l be different when you 'r e through ?
you bend my heart and mind and you UNknown my soul
and your stone walls turn my blood a little cold
san quentin may you rot and burn in hell
may your walls fall and may i live to tell
may all the world forgets you ever stood
and may all the world regrets you did no good
san quentin i hate every inch of you
many of them have to pay protection to survive
and i feel that this type of thing UNknown a lot of inmates
i think practically every inmate in an institution has his own way of survival
this causes him to not be able to act himself
i UNknown e seen cases where inmates have wrapped their arms with toilet paper to make UNknown m look big and UNknown up
just as a means of survival
most of the people here are paranoiac
we had a work strike which later resulted in
a UNknown thing between one group against another and resulted in the majority of the inmates in the institution UNknown
when you came out of the mess hall that day you walked right into the middle of a racial UNknown
and it was black on one side and mexican and white on the other side
and you were just UNknown forced into you know going to your own by nothing else but skin UNknown
i 'm not a fascist but i am a UNknown
i don 't believe in UNknown
it creates a lot of UNknown especially with the younger generation of black people who are taking the UNknown views
as far as i 'm concerned i have no part of UNknown
i was raised like they were i had nothing
i 'd go out and steal what i wanted to get
they want everything on a platter
i feel they should find their own UNknown
i started out in the department some 22 years ago working with youngsters
came out of marine corps i didn 't have much money and i 'd see people with money i knew about weapons so i figured it 'd be easy
so i just picked it up started robbing
this concerns a 1 4 year old girl and two 16 year old girls
we had a sort of a l don 't know what going on you know
and the police came in
i figured that money would cure all the problems i had and take care of all my needs at the time which i realise now this isn 't true
don 't get me wrong i still like money but i know that 's an improper way of obtaining it
i 'm 32 years old now
i UNknown e been doing it ever since
i UNknown e been doing it every day i do it every day seven days a week
and you know it gets to be like a job you know ?
and there 's days where i don 't steal and i get depressed
know what i mean ?
and the next day i go out and i steal double
and then i feel happy
i used to be a professional fighter and lost my temper one time and hit somebody and hurt him pretty bad so my beef is assault that 's my problem
well i 'm not proud of it believe me i regret it
i always have and always will but
i was at a party and there was drink there and i was one of the drinkers
this woman was one of the drinkers too a friend of mine
she was a customer of mine at the station
and we were there and she had a 12 year old son and he 'd already gone to bed
i don 't know why but i did i
i strangled both of UNknown m
all i can remember clearly is her starting screaming
he 's UNknown me he 's UNknown me
god knows i don 't know why i done it
when the judge told me i was to be taken to san quentin and be executed as prescribed by law
and all i could do was just look at the judge and that 's it
but it really hits you when they show you your slip of paper your UNknown of your death sentence
and i looked at that slip of paper and it said on march 10th at UNknown you will be executed
we bring him out of the cell and place a set of leather cuffs on him take him down a flight of
i mean an elevator five floors and put him in a holding cell where he stays for the night
all UNknown that haven 't already been made are made at that time
we find out naturally what he wants for his dinner that night
what kind of UNknown if any that he wants to listen to
lf he wants coffee or if he wants tea or milk or whatever the case may be
then if he hasn 't previously done so we find out his religious preference
who he would like to spend some time with him during the night if anyone
you have well you can do a variety of things
you found out a lot about some people
some of these fellas that you 'r e neighbours with
the kind of life they UNknown e led and
such a lot of them preaching on about their UNknown and all that
and actually everybody up there i think they 'r e scared but some of them don 't want to admit it
they keep trying to reassure themselves that they 'r e not scared
and this way they like to exaggerate a little
i UNknown e seen several fellas go downstairs to be executed next morning
the custom is that the evening when they take you down they come round shake hands you know you stop at each cell and shake hands
what can you say to a man that 's going down there to be executed ?
don 't breathe too deeply something like that you know ?
and some are on the verge of cracking
but you can see them just UNknown themselves so the tears won 't come and won 't show
and several of them have gone down there with tears in their eyes and UNknown shaking they 'r e all really scared
other guys i UNknown e seen going down smiling
couple of fellas have told me that one of the guys was practically running to the gas chamber
he wanted to get it over with
i would say at first they 'r e afraid
but i think after a few days they get in a routine and they live a comparatively easy good life on condemned row during the time they 'r e waiting
they 'r e fed exceptionally well
because they do an awful lot of cell time they get a couple two and a half hours of exercise in the corridors during the day
and this is about all
the only time they get to go outside is when they 'r e going to and from visits
i was born and raised brought up as a catholic
i was an altar boy and
then when i got older i sort of UNknown away from my church but it brought me back to my faith
not because of the crime just it
i figure i 'd still think this way if i 'd have probably stayed with my church
went to church every sunday and
i probably wouldn 't have wound up here
we went into the little town of UNknown just over the hill from nazareth
and there 's a church that sits over the UNknown where the water came from that christ turned to wine where the first miracle was performed
we went into the church saw the UNknown you can hear the sounds of the water in there hear the echo
i was so impressed when i came out of the church if i ever had an inspiration i had one then from seeing what i had just seen and heard
and i said under my breath he turned the water into wine of all things
on the way in the car in the next few minutes i wrote this song
the executions are normally carried out at UNknown on UNknown
just prior to the execution we go into the cell and dress him
he normally wears a pair of blue jeans and a white shirt
his arms are strapped his legs are strapped and he 's strapped around his chest
then the chamber is sealed and on the word from the warden the gas is applied
almost in all cases the reaction is the same
from the time the man is placed in the chamber until he 's pronounced dead is not longer than 1 4 or 15 minutes
he is to all UNknown and purposes dead long before that
and i UNknown e never even seen this happen so i don 't believe that there 's any pain whatsoever
most of them want to go in a valiant fashion
they think it 's important to die like a man
my mother came to see me in the morning it was a little difficult trying to more or less soothe her feelings she was more UNknown than i was
i was scared i always have been scared but
i told her this is the way it 's gonna be and i 'm gonna go
i didn 't wanna go but you just can 't do anything at that time
i talked to the rest of the fellas and
but i was in a little bit of a daze though
i was thinking about tomorrow morning what was going to happen the next morning rather
and managed to survive that afternoon
and then i heard them coming up for me
the four officers that usually come up to take a man down to the holding cell next to the gas chamber
and then the officer came down and he said
you 'd better sit down i got some news for you
and i knew my attorney was trying to contact justice douglas
but he must have got in contact with him because the officer told me it was going to the state
it was just like a big load coming off your shoulders
and i did get down and say a prayer bowed down on my knees and said a prayer of thanks
speedy gonzales the son of the approximately seven brothers
a bottle of whiskey and a coke for the kid
i can 't believe i missed you
maybe you just can 't shoot ?
or maybe i UNknown ?
i pay for the bottles
no they 'r e free
on the contrary do you want some more ?
pour me a beer sonny
you 'r e just passing by i suppose ?
i 'm afraid that you have gone too far away from home now
this new york is still a small town but i can assure you it will get bigger and i can 't protect all the UNknown
someone here shot him in the back
the investigation is still going on
yes and i UNknown l continue it
what 's up clyde ?
you recognised me again ?
the end of the world must be near as the horses are shrinking
maybe it ate something bad
or maybe it has too small hide
let 's UNknown it so it can grow more
maybe it 's a kangaroo since it has bags under the eyes
yes and there 's bags on the knees too
it must be a kangaroo
those are good at jumping i tell you
try to jump over it !
i think that the owner of this kangaroo is reaching to see over the saloon door
do you eat some hay ?
i UNknown l give you some
no don 't give so long UNknown
such a small animal can 't eat so long UNknown
we have to cut UNknown m shorter
we haven 't introduced ourselves yet
tell me something about moses !
for a moment i thought he 's back from dead
hello UNknown of the west
pay first the previous drinks !
couldn 't i have just one more
how many ? a couple
shot dead it makes 30
ten of spades jack of spades UNknown
queen of spades king of spades and a ace of spades
bat you 'r e playing honest
what do you mean ?
you 'r e cheating nevertheless
two ace of spades !
that 's UNknown 's chair
i raise 3 4 more
actually the drinks last night were not on the house
they were on the house anyway
do you want more ?
do you know anything about moses ?
everything is little messed up in this town
i advice you to leave and forget it all
but there 's too many of them who do you mean ?
one large UNknown coffin !
my pa died finally !
that 's so sad hoss
pa just died drinks for everyone
i UNknown l pay !
finally i can start having some good time
where 's all the girls ?
how about your kid brother joe ?
a couple of 2 meters long crude plank !
you wanna know who killed your brother ?
i don 't believe you
you better stop digging this case and leave this town
then i have to shoot you too
raise your little hands up !
same goes for you missy !
what 's happening here ?
money or your life !
3 men just came and took everything
i can 't believe it
oh it 's you clyde ?
what a rotten luck !
you didn 't recognise me ?
let 's see if anything 's left
i don 't think there 's even a cent left
they made a good job
they were professionals you see
what are they doing here in our place ?
don 't be sad clyde !
i give you something from my own pocket so it 's not a futile visit
here you go something for you too
don 't put your gun away during the robbery
thank you i UNknown l visit you tomorrow
i saved your life again
have you ever seen a man hanged with the guns still on his belt ?
you could be the UNknown of the west
but i 'm even slower
are you picking a fight with me ?
can UNknown give a you a little advice senorita ?
senorita would be very wise if she 'd take his boyfriend with her and leave this town
we UNknown e run out of the crude planks
can i go now ?
and what 's there ?
can i go now ?
i was supposed to rob a bank and it 's almost their closing time
damn i 'm getting tired of you playing a bank robber !
be once a man and rob a train or something !
and if you 'r e not improving with your jobs i shall change to real bullets !
it 's a quiet bunch here
they 'r e getting nervous
believe me you better leave here
what the hell is going on here ?
there 's too many of them
can 't you just leave before it 's too late ?
it 's already too late
one of you boys killed my brother
i UNknown l find out eventually
even if i have to shoot you all
you 'r e beginning to be a quite a nuisance speedy
why do you always forget the women ?
how does it look ?
it 's a clean bottom sonny
it looks like someone shot you with UNknown to the ass
look we can arrange a divorce for you
we can accuse her of mental cruelty and the holes in your ass
i got things to do
i said hands up and go against the wall !
i got things to do
the jury seems to be ready sitting in their right place
this trial can be started
UNknown of the west you UNknown l be the prosecutor !
and what 's the charge ?
he shot banker to his belly because he was too slow to turn his back
and what the defense has to say ?
the late banker was known as should i say UNknown man
you had to be very fast to shoot him in the belly
because he cowardly always tried to turn his back
clyde has proved with his many former robberies to be a proper bank robber
who didn 't harm the personnel
so if a man happens to miss a shot with his gun
i don 't think that 's so aggravating
i think that 's very sensible
so shall we hear more witnesses or shall we let him go ?
as a prosecutor i want to hear more UNknown so we can have a laugh
UNknown could you say a few words ?
i think clyde is innocent
banker 's death was a result of a wrong choice of a career
it 's wrong that one man keeps a lot of money locked up
people are living in poverty and misery
although with all those pesos we could build a better society
or amigos drink some good tequila !
if banker had chose to be a farmer
he would be tending a little sheep on his little farm right now loved by all
and he 'd live today and with good luck also tomorrow
you agree with us !
i think we all know that clyde was banker 's best friend
if there was no money in the bank when clyde was robbing it banker gave from his own purse
that was true friendship my friends !
but he went too far with it
he couldn 't stand watching clyde suffering from his failures
when clyde once again fumbled with his gun and couldn 't hit with it
banker wanted to prevent clyde feeling incompetent
and shot himself in the belly thus letting clyde feel some well deserved joy of killing
that was true friendship boys
the court has decided that the banker committed suicide
strange thing is that such a bad shooter could hit from such a short distance
let 's go for drinks everyone
clyde is free to go
and now drinks for everyone my treat
now he UNknown l be buried next to his brother
UNknown i thought he began to discover it all
amigo it was a close call
i wonder who shot him
in any case let 's hope we 'r e finally through with this
moses needed to be killed
and only one interested will be soon six feet under
it 's best to hold our tongue on this matter
no one knows who killed moses gonzales if someone happens to ask about it
amigo you need to remind the sheriff and the bartender too
also no one knows who killed speedy gonzales
but we don 't know who did it anyway
tom bury him deep !
i don 't like ghosts
hey don 't fight boys
well now 's there a bullet hole ready
i UNknown l be the boss around here from now on
if someone has something against it he 's welcome to draw
i got taste of dirt in my mouth
i don 't exactly know what has happened and how you 'r e here again but you better drink that whisky and hit the road
before you end up like your brother
a bullet in the back right ?
you might guess what i want to ask ?
they UNknown l kill me if i tell you anything
i doesn 't matter who kills you and i 'm the first one in the queue of killers
i wasn 't there myself but the others
moses gonzales you know me ?
well what 's the problem ?
it was done by men from our town
i was eating strawberries on the railway and i saw the whole thing
did you recognise anyone ?
i clearly saw UNknown masterson hoss and clyde
no but maybe this is enough
this information was worth of gold
and you UNknown l be rewarded with some metal too
i hope it 's not nickel
right there 's our strawberry picker
amigos who UNknown l do it ?
it 's difficult to hit a moving target
clyde couldn 't hit him anyway
at least if i go nearer
i don 't believe you
what did i say ?
second one hit already but i made it sure
i UNknown e always said that strawberries are dangerous to your health
no one speaks nothing about this then guys
we 'r e under the threat of death penalty
otherwise we UNknown l be all hanged
that 's how it was
even if you shoot me
my UNknown are getting numb
what are we waiting for ?
bomb is placed now and they 'r e both inside
yep the vultures will have a flying lunch soon
shall i do it yet ?
let 's split up !
i UNknown l go that way
say hello to your pa !
for once i drew fast
and now we run !
go on and chew it !
fortunately we get more men tomorrow shut up !
i just said that we
i said shut up !
i kill you all !
nothing 's gonna stop me
you won 't shed ash to my hand anymore speedy gonzales
now we UNknown l make a plan for tomorrow
in the morning we UNknown l go to the shore of indian pond to ambush speedy
what are you thinking ?
i have a feeling that they UNknown l go to the shore of indian pond to ambush us
but i think that speedy knows that we 'r e going to ambush him in the shore of indian pond
so he UNknown l go to the mountains
but sheriff will figure that i know they UNknown l ambush me in the shore of indian pond
so they go to the mountains but we UNknown l go
we UNknown l go to sleep
turn off the light please
it 's your final moments now
you can 't shoot because i have the girl
it 's easy to shoot when there 's a hole already
it 's your turn now speedy
why haven 't you shot me until now ?
i missed you on the first time
and it was fun to watch you kill a bunch of bandits during this time
what do you mean ?
you shot bill last year
i had to choose between bill and me
wake me up again !
rosa was hiding me in the cellar for two months you see
they tried to kill me and it was close too
but now i got out of the cellar
and there goes speedy gonzales
a man who killed bat masterson
hoss UNknown UNknown of the west and sheriff
and all this because his brother happened to pick strawberries on the railway
i want to see you working
i UNknown e been wanting to do this for weeks
i just didn 't know you felt the same way
what is going on around here ?
we know that mac was involved
listen mac might be bent but he 's not stupid
you know the deal jarvis
you never bring attention to yourself
now you UNknown e done it alex
you went and got mac all agitated
this is an outrage !
i made it quite clear di drake either with me or against me
that man 's got more decency in his little finger than you UNknown l ever have
your loyalty does you credit ray
there you see marvellous magic
oh orville what 's the matter ?
cos i 'm really worried about alex
i think she 's going to die
don 't worry she 's not going to die !
she 's at the hospital
you should be happy !
i UNknown e told you i 'm having nothing to do with this
now go and be a pain in the UNknown for the bloody UNknown
because we are sick of the sight of you got it ?
well i hope you 'r e all proud of yourselves
it UNknown your sperm count you know it 's been medically proven
UNknown did say that having babies was pretty high on her agenda
have you seen this guv ?
it 's all about mac and jarvis
they might as well point the finger at every one of us
why can 't these brain dead piss heads have a go at someone else ?
some kid even UNknown in my face this morning just cos i was a copper
do you think the press knows about operation rose ?
if there 's any digging to be done on operation rose it UNknown l be done by us not them
in the meantime we need something to shut them up like a bloody big collar
burglary at number two stanley road guv you still near there ?
give it to UNknown viv
well come on let 's go !
it 's pete 's dad
just start the car !
he 's molly 's father
we UNknown e got to get to the UNknown !
don 't tell me they have the misfortune of being related to you ?
this is going to be seriously weird
that UNknown l make a nice change !
my name is alex drake
i UNknown e been shot and that bullet has taken me back in time
now i 'm lost in UNknown
and all i can do is fight and search and stay alive
because somehow i will find a way home
bryan are you ok ?
he can 't hear you
if i 'd have thought instead of being so caught up in everything i could have done something
it 's all gone a bit UNknown UNknown
she takes her community relations very seriously
might be some UNknown on some of this stuff guv
come on we 'r e going
well we can 't just leave her !
marjorie we UNknown l do everything we can to help you
won 't we inspector hunt ?
and a necklace that i was wearing
bryan tried to stop the man
in the struggle he was pushed hit his head on that table there
how much money was taken ?
about 163 ; 1 000
bryan 's never trusted banks
how could you abandon molly like that ?
i wouldn 't abandon her
well how come when she 's six months old you just bugger off never to be seen again ?
has anyone ever told you you 'r e a bit weird ?
has anybody ever told you that you can 't go around accusing detective inspectors of being weird especially ones who are really pissed off !
why are you giving me such a hard time ?
shouldn 't you be trying to find the burglar ?
where were you when your dad was attacked ?
mum called and they told me to come home
when i got back here she was crying
you 'r e going to have to be really strong for her
think you can do that ?
what 's with the police car outside ?
we UNknown e been UNknown
found him doing a bit more than a UNknown with my best friend so i told him where to shove his UNknown
is bryan all right ?
we don 't know yet
i UNknown e got to go and see him
only if it 's no trouble
least i can do UNknown
i hope you 'r e going to keep those baby blues peeled for him officer
london accent not that he spoke much
just asked us to keep quiet
what about his face ?
i told you i ain 't done nothin !
you 'r e the only one who wears a thatcher mask on a job
you only hit him once
with any luck he might pick up that new channel
i UNknown e only seen that UNknown on it
it UNknown l never last
tv in the afternoon is for students with greasy hair and the UNknown insane
mind you she is insane
she thinks she 's married to malcolm UNknown
i hate to interrupt but there 's a man over there being beaten to a pulp excuse me !
how many fingers am i holding up ?
don 't ask him difficult questions drake
he 'd have UNknown by now
this has been about as useful as a new pair of slippers for douglas UNknown !
let 's get back to some real work shall we ?
i UNknown e had it with this shit
this case will affect people for years
that might not matter to you but it matters to me
the only thing that matters is us getting our headline not UNknown about with a case the UNknown should be dealing with
he might be awake now
UNknown gave it to me
she might take me to see a match
even though you hate football
you 'r e going cos you fancy her are you ?
no no i don 't
when you lie you always tend to look down
i know a little girl who does that
no i don 't !
sorry i didn 't mean to intrude
i just wanted to see how he was
he 's very UNknown after the op
there 's a chance there might be permanent damage to his hearing
oh i keep doing that
i forget he can 't hear
would you like me to sit with him ?
well he wouldn 't expect you to
i won 't be long
i know you can 't hear me bryan
and i can 't change what 's happened
i 'm kind of learning that now
but i want you to know that you will cope with this
when pete left me with molly you were the one person who made me believe that it wasn 't the end of my life
the end of my career
and this isn 't the end of your career either
you know you once told me that taking up painting again was the best thing you ever did
i UNknown e still got the painting you did of molly somewhere
you 'r e going to be such a fantastic grandad
and i won 't rest until i found out who did this to you
if anyone here is anything less than squeaky clean you pack your things and get the hell out
shit sticks to one of us it sticks to all of us
i for one have had enough
i 'm the sheriff i say we keep it clean
we need a decent headline
what else do we know about mickey dillon ?
did he know the UNknown ?
am i talking to myself ?
did somebody say something then ?
it 's not funny UNknown !
a man has been seriously injured and we need to find who 's done it
i wish i could remember all the details but i can 't so i need your help
whether you like it or not metal mickey is the only lead that we UNknown e got
what are you doing drake ?
i 'm trying to solve a crime guv
what 's up with you ?
have you got a UNknown stuck up your arse ?
he UNknown l crack by tonight i UNknown e got a fiver on it
UNknown says he UNknown l crack before
UNknown are in on that robbery on the UNknown guv
it 's not our case viv
you might want to reconsider
they all speak at once
isn 't this where you all usually run out shouting let 's get the bastard ?
except the bastard in question has been six feet under for two years
do you know what it looks like we might have ourselves a headline
have you got any UNknown mrs UNknown ?
home made flapjacks in the biscuit tin
blimey it 's like the sahara in here elsie
yeah smashing ain 't it ?
little bugger never smiled in any of his school photos hated the place
he felt he never fitted in
still make them for him even though he 's not here ?
used to sit where you are now
playing all the old songs UNknown off the flapjacks
don 't fence me in
he used to love that one
you make him sound like a little angel elsie
sometimes it 's like he 's right here with me now
daft isn 't it when he 's brown bread
did george know the UNknown at all ?
stanley road a couple of streets away from here ?
i 'm not good with names dear
i 'd know UNknown m if i saw UNknown m
it 's just that something a little bit strange has happened
george 's fingerprints were found over at the UNknown
how did they get there ?
mr drake was quite badly hurt
he 's a lovely man
you got any savings elsie ?
pebble mill 's on and i never miss
just one other thing elsie love
bastard 's UNknown me up like a UNknown
even if UNknown is alive
that UNknown bastard 's alive he must have stashed his money in elsie 's biscuit tin
it doesn 't mean to say he UNknown the UNknown
he doesn 't think twice about knee UNknown people
but it 's not UNknown 's mo
if it was a well know gangster or something i 'd remember
look just trust me it can 't be george UNknown
who 's seen him ?
come on someone 's seen him someone 's hiding him
you UNknown e all worked for him
ah but has he ?
come on someone speak up
it 's worth a few quid
last bloke what said anythin about george UNknown was him
he could UNknown e played for UNknown an all couldn 't you charlie ?
wants you to call him
i UNknown l deal with mickey
put on my desk was a newspaper headline that says time to vet the met what 's this all about hunt ?
i want the next thing i hear about you and your rotten department is that you UNknown e made a decent collar
where else would he be ?
results hunt and good ones !
if i suddenly get a whiff of funny business in this department again i UNknown l come down on you like a
i told you i UNknown e never heard of UNknown m
stop UNknown us about mickey !
if you don 't co operate with us i swear to you that i will personally see to it that your nuts get squeezed very tightly in a vice

i UNknown e had enough so sort this mess out now !
i want a decent headline for the met by monday morning or i UNknown l have you again
keep an eye on him chris
it 's been medically proven
i UNknown e got five kids
sure they 'r e all yours ?
UNknown where 's ray ?
i can 't find him anywhere
maybe gone off in a sulk ?
him and chris have been in a funny mood all day
is the guv still on the phone to the commissioner ?
yeah i dunno what 's wrong with everyone
chris shouted at me when i asked him what he was doing
what are you doing in here ?
look mickey isn 't giving anything away
i thought maybe you could persuade him ?
what 's the point ?
ray i know you 'r e angry about mac
i looked up to him
all he 's done is piss on our reputation
there are good honest families out there like the UNknown who need us
all right all right !
i don 't know nothin about the job on the UNknown but what i do know is george ain 't dead
he paid me to identify his body except it was some old tramp that 'd been burnt in a fire
george made sure his sovereign ring was found on the body
told me he wanted to disappear to spain
that 's the last i saw of him
the man who was buried was a tramp
UNknown paid mickey to identify him
i need this collar or the commissioner 's going to have my UNknown in a UNknown
if i may UNknown dorothy parker i don 't think we should put all our eggs in one bastard
what other bastard have we got ?
well you don 't still think it 's mickey ?
i don 't know but there might be someone else in the frame now
mickey said UNknown went to spain
UNknown with the drake family aren 't you UNknown ?
i UNknown e got to know them over the months yeah
got to know their UNknown and UNknown
where they kept things in the house like bryan drake 's wages
you 'r e accusing me of stealing from bryan ?
how 's he managed that ?
don 't piss us about sweetheart
you UNknown e got a make up round on his old stomping ground
he 's been in spain
tell you what why don 't you UNknown it over for the night ?
gentleman came in earlier ma 'a m asked me to give you this
about the same height as the guv
do i look like the sort of woman who hangs around with gangsters ?
is that a yes or a no ?
you 'r e very tense aren 't you UNknown UNknown ?
still s UNknown UNknown it must be hard in your game having to play the tough man all the time
can 't kid a UNknown
you 'r e a bit like clint UNknown aren 't you ?
the days of coppers being seen as heroes love are gone
we 'r e not even liked
in fact we 'r e hated by some
what would you do instead ?
there could be a UNknown again any time they UNknown l need good men like me
yeah but a dead hero 's no use to anyone is he ?
yeah it 's bryan drake
you know you 'r e only replacing one vice with another one baby
i want everyone in early tomorrow working on the UNknown case
right curry and a pint
well he 's russian isn 't he ?
no he 's english as far as i know
my name is martin summers
you stay where you are
go ahead shoot though i have to warn you that you may be getting rid of the one person who could help you here
so don 't be scared
you make UNknown phone calls you send me roses
like some sort of crazed UNknown and you tried to poison me
i shouldn 't be scared ?
well i had to make sure you were the person i was looking for
there aren 't a lot of people here from the other world
would that help convince you ?
is that why you 'r e here ?
to help me get home ?
you and i are the only two people here who actually know what that means
still it 's a relief to talk about it yes ?
much easier cross UNknown dna i find though don 't you ?
you know about operation rose
that 's why you sent me the roses isn 't it ?
operation rose could be your exit route
it 's about police corruption
mac he warned us about it
it won 't be pretty
but how much do you want to see your daughter again ?
if you 'r e so sure you can get me home why are you still here ?
you 'r e not the only one whose dying here alex
i can live the life i want
i could go back but i don 't want to
you on the other hand have a decision to make as to what you 'r e willing to do to have that chance
you want me to be corrupt ?
in six months time when molly 's face is faded from your memory you UNknown l be begging me to help you
i haven 't got much time to wait for an answer
can i ask you a favour
will you find out everything you can about a man called martin summers
is he a suspect ma 'a m ?
i 'm sorry to be vague but it could be something really important to me
anything else to go on ?
what makes you think she won 't lie to us again today ?
who said she lied ?
come on guv she knew that money was in the biscuit tin
elsie 's not a UNknown
she never took a penny from any of UNknown jobs
i bet she didn 't even know the money was in there
why call her in then ?
cos george thought the cock eyed world of his mum
we keep her here he UNknown l start wondering where she is
we UNknown l have to let her go
are you ready elsie love ?
ok elsie and you darling
now then elsie are you going to tell us where your naughty boy is ?
you know where he is six feet under
you trying to send me UNknown ?
the lady you just said hello to
she popped in yesterday for a UNknown
said she was an old friend of george 's
what are you two waiting for ?
go get her back here now !
a word of advice blondie don 't even think about lying again or you UNknown l be seeing me in your nightmares for the rest of your life
you knew UNknown wasn 't dead !
least the george you knew
he isn 't the man you think he is
he is trying to change
i know he hurt people
i swear i had no idea he was going to rob marjorie and bryan
i couldn 't believe it
i felt so bad for them
but not bad enough that you couldn 't come to us ?
how could you do that to them ?
where is he UNknown ?
you 'r e not leaving here till you tell us
what 's it worth ?
we don 't respond to bribery
get him to meet you at one of his old haunts
he doesn 't go in for UNknown as much as he used to
you just make sure he 's there tonight UNknown and don 't even think about doing a runner
haven 't you forgotten something ?
it 's the perfect bloody get in isn 't it ?
use a friendly blonde to case the joint for you and bingo he 's in
how could she do that to them ?
she 's supposed to be their friend
now bryan 's deaf for the rest of his life
if you don 't stop crying i might even start feeling sorry for you and god forbid i might even have to put a comforting arm around you
well i 'd better stop then
if only i could have done something
you can 't blame yourself
you don 't understand you can never understand
if i 'd remembered then i could have stopped it
listen to me we have the public 's faith in us going down faster than linda UNknown
one thing i can be sure of is that gene hunt will find this UNknown and put him away till the end of his days
come on dry your eyes UNknown we UNknown e got scum to catch
it 's a filthy habit
this is a waste of time this is
the guv UNknown that everything UNknown l be all UNknown dory if we get UNknown
i reckon it 's too late the rot 's set in
we can 't let him get off with it can we ?
it 's what we do best
ray is she there yet ?
chris check inside the pub to see if she 's in there or UNknown
she can 't have just vanished
just found her laying here
we should have kept a closer eye on her
yeah there 's a pulse
looks like UNknown found her before we did
must UNknown e UNknown that she was setting him up
george UNknown is a vicious bastard so why didn 't he finish her off ?
maybe he thought he had ?
he 's still out there somewhere
he never did like hospitals
the doctors say his hearing may come back in time
it came in the afternoon post
i UNknown e only just opened it
we haven 't long been back from the hospital
it 's 163 ; 500
what 's UNknown got to do with this ?
i think he 's a bit shaken by it all actually
he won 't say you know what lads are
yeah would you like me to have a chat
oh you UNknown e got green eyes
oh you UNknown e got blue eyes can i come in ?
i 'd forgotten it did that
i can 't work her out sometimes
where did you get the money to buy dope ?
i UNknown e seen you
i know where you keep it
don 't go in there don 't go in
what 's this necklace doing here ?
is this the one your mum
this is the necklace that was stolen
is this the bad thing you did when you were a UNknown
you 'r e a thief !
he is the thief !
how did the money get back to his parents house ?
what 's he doing with his mum 's stolen necklace
where does he get the money to buy weed ?
he 's too bloody lazy to get a job
no he 'd rather lay around in bed all day working on the novel that only exists in his head
have you been at the gin ?
you don 't know what he 's like
seems there 's more to UNknown mason than meets the eye guv
i UNknown e seen a woman from hazel grove put UNknown somewhere a UNknown should never go
i UNknown e seen a bloke from UNknown balance a UNknown on his hampton wick but i UNknown e never ever seen anything like that before
i just don 't get it
i mean those UNknown they were the real deal but down the old goal end
a bloody great big knob
he 's had a sex change but he 's only had half the op
must UNknown e had surgery done to the face at the same time cos you wouldn 't know him
who 'd put themselves through all that pain ?
just you wait boys before you know it you UNknown l all be asking for a back crack and sack
is that UNknown speak for rice UNknown ?
norman hunter dresses up in UNknown UNknown ?
geoff UNknown starts playing with barbie dolls ?
UNknown john fancies blokes ?
i don 't get it
so down below he was gonna have it er
well he certainly caught the attention of you three
guv she 's mid UNknown maybe i should deal with it ?
sometimes your lack of faith in me seriously UNknown di drake
when were you going to say UNknown loo to the old UNknown then ?
in about six feet of very brown stuff
you better start talking or you UNknown l be saying goodbye to your UNknown sooner than you think UNknown
i UNknown l only talk if you call me by my name UNknown
why the hell should i when you 'r e still half george ?
still the same thieving scumbag
once a UNknown always a UNknown
come on george be a good boy and start talking
i UNknown l call you what i damn well want you gender bending UNknown UNknown freak of nature
should i stay or should i go now ?
should i stay or should i go now ?
if i go there will be trouble
if i stay it will be double
i needed the money to pay for the rest of the op
but they ripped me off
what only gave you one UNknown ?
said they 'd tell the authorities if i didn 't pay more
why did you have to hurt bryan ?
him and marjorie weren 't meant to be there
i was just desperate for the money for the op
to be the person i always knew i was
so why did you come back to the UNknown ?
i knew i 'd left my UNknown there
marjorie asked me to look after peter then i was stuck
i don 't blame him for what he did
what did he do ?
he saw me wearing his mum 's necklace
chased after him he thought i was going to attack him or something
he picked up a brick
i felt a thud on the back of my head
next thing i 'm in here
why did you go and see elsie ?
when i saw her i felt bad bent over with rheumatism still struggling to make ends meet
so you left her the money in her tin ?
promise me one thing ?
don 't tell her the truth
it 'd break her heart
you my little UNknown friend are in no position to make demands
sending scum like you down might restore people 's faith in us a little bit
you 'd be a hell of a loss to the police
UNknown me up is not gonna stop me putting these on you
i want to go to sleep at night knowing there 's cops like you helping keep good people like my mum safe
besides UNknown 's not your colour
why 's your face all red ?
cos it 's hot in here
why did you give the drake family that 500 quid ?
the 500 quid that was in that tin
must have been a bit of a shock finding all that money in there eh ?
i UNknown l say !
i UNknown e no idea how it got there but when you told me about that poor bryan drake and i read about it in the papers
i felt sorry for him
you could have kept it for yourself and had a holiday in the UNknown
except it wasn 't mine was it ?
anyway what do i want to go to the bleedin UNknown for ?
can 't take the heat me
why didn 't you tell me what had happened instead of running away like that ?
cos i thought i 'd be in big trouble
i could UNknown e killed her
you won 't say anything ?
well technically you UNknown e assaulted someone
will i go to jail ?
and be really nice to whoever you end up with
whether it 's suzie or a girl called alex
and look after molly that 's really important
it 's never too late peter
just the two of us we can make it if we try
just the two of us
just the two of us
just the two of us building castles in the sky
just the two of us
we look for a love no time for tears
wasted all of those years
and they don 't make those flowers grow
good things might come to those who wait
not for those who wait too late we UNknown e got to go for all we know
just the two of us
it 's an easy mistake to make
i mean that boy george he looks like a woman
yeah you fancied him before i told you
i don 't care but please please start smoking again because i can 't take much more of you being a UNknown UNknown
now come on we should just be in time for the UNknown
no well there wouldn 't be would there ?
i mean he 's not supposed to be here like me
no problem ma 'a m
what was that all about ?
i ain 't got a clue
you know i thought i knew it all UNknown
now i 'm beginning to wonder maybe i know the square root of jack shit
is this where i 'm supposed to disagree with you ?
it 's just my luck
i could retire on this
be known as the bloke who UNknown george UNknown when all around failed
what and break his mum 's heart ?
it 's not her fault she loves him
what did you tell her ?
UNknown mason 's been arrested for the robbery
which is why george UNknown never gets sent down
why what have i done now ?
because despite all the UNknown put downs the insults the pathetic UNknown side UNknown underneath it all you are a good kind decent man
keep your voice down somebody might hear
i am going to buy you a very large drink
don 't flatter yourself sweetheart
luigi put them on my tab
i owe you one anyway
i saw you filling out the form
now you have to stay
i haven 't got much bloody choice have i ?
do you have an answer for me ?
i know you could be my only chance of getting back
and you know how much i miss my daughter
i would do anything to see her again
but what you want me to do what you want me to be is corrupt and dishonest
i 'm sorry but i simply can 't
and so the answer is thanks but no thanks
i don 't know how but i UNknown l find my own way back
if i can 't change your mind maybe operation rose will
i think you did the right thing signorina drake
i laughed and shook his hand and made my way back home
i searched for form and land for years and years i roamed
i UNknown a UNknown stare at all the millions here
we must have died a long a long long time ago
you might not have much time left
you know i UNknown e had harder UNknown than you
what are you doing !
friday night after a curry
i don 't sit there and UNknown on the individual 's role in society my son
i flush UNknown m away
UNknown go fetch me my search warrant
when did you have time to get a search warrant ?
what do we do now ?
we 'r e the police !
you 'r e enjoying this aren 't you ?
have you got a light there mate ?
won 't you give me a reduction ?
you think money comes by easy ?
money comes by easy ?
did you deposit my pension ?
i didn 't have time
it would be better if you had done it today
i UNknown l do it tomorrow
what 's the difference ?
the interest would have started
a day later does it matter ?
a day is one more day
how much is that ?
business must have opened up with this fine weather
i 'm thinking of coming to the shop

we have nothing for you
i want a man 's shirt

i 'm buying this shirt but i don 't want to carry it around
please bring it when you come home
i UNknown l pay you at home
do me this little favor
don 't tell me you don 't like money
for my wants for my needs
there 's no end to that
have you ever stolen anything ?
when you were a kid ?
once i threw a hotel towel into my suitcase
i UNknown e never stolen anything
years ago i had bought shoes and by mistake they gave me back as change three times the amount i had given them
what did you do ?
i took it and left
you stole it you mean
i was in high school
one night my uncle 's family came to visit us
my uncle had this beautiful lighter
i couldn 't take my eyes off it
at one point he dropped the lighter in the armchair
it slid beneath the cushion
i waited quietly all night
first thing i did in the morning was to pocket the lighter
that 's also stealing !
is there a limit to what you would do for money ?
UNknown i should be going now
i wouldn 't harm others
that 's a little difficult
when will the UNknown arrive ?
i UNknown l have them delivered to you
it 's very good stuff
did you get hurt ?
it 's not my fault you jumped on the road
besides my car is scratched
you can buy 3 shirts for the price i UNknown l pay to get that scratch fixed
i don 't complain and you tell me my shirt
my brother went out i thought i 'd stop by
i had already finished eating
so you 'r e alone tonight
i was about to go to bed
i won 't force my way in
i UNknown l take my shirt
sorry i was getting ready to sleep
we UNknown l take care of it later
four white shirts size one
three white shirts size three two short sleeves size one
will you buy all of them ?
are there any blues ?
one blue large largest you UNknown e got
how much for the lot ?
that 's short 30 dollars
you 'r e like an exchange office
here 's a 100 francs
we 'r e 2 pounds short
you UNknown l accept turkish lira ?
there 's not much at this time
what 's wrong selim ?
how much did he take ?
let 's notify the police right away
there 's nothing to fear
maybe they UNknown l catch him
what reason is that ?
the son of a bitch !
you know who it was
well why don 't you have him caught ?
he 's just a poor guy
you 'r e really something selim
the guy comes and robs you one day after he 's dismissed and you forgive him
only if he makes this into a habit we UNknown l be ruined
i 'd get him caught if i were you
or if you like we can get him and get the money back
you probably know his whereabouts
thank you UNknown i UNknown l take care of it
do you know his address ?
well how will you find him ?
the police can trace him from his name
you 'r e some compassionate guy
excuse my saying so but i think this is stupidity
safe number 148 is yours
do you want to use it now ?
my friend here will help you
mr h UNknown in !
you haven 't even touched UNknown 's dish
she says 'i insisted but he didn 't want
she had to force the 'd UNknown 's on you
she came to the shop
well how about that ?
a man 's shirt ?
she had something else in mind
it wasn 't this bad
did she pay for it ?
UNknown has built a very nice house on the shore
i say people have got fortunes
i went and looked at our piece of land
one of the olive trees has gone dry
UNknown said 's ell it we UNknown l get a small place for you here on the shore and you can build a house i said you wouldn 't want
so what do you say ?
but first we should buy this flat
everybody thinks you UNknown e got a lot of money
well well i see you UNknown e fired the helper !
isn 't that right ?
you fired him didn 't you ?
what did this one do ?
they 'r e all the same
you should hire somebody right away
you can 't leave the shop for a second
no i 'm not hiring anyone
it 's better like this
i don 't have time
yesterday i found two incredible paintings
i couldn 't make out the signature
i 'm sure it 's a russian painter
the antique dealer doesn 't know how valuable they are
i would make a fortune
that 's what you said last time
i 'm positive about these !
how much does he want ?
but i UNknown l get him to go down
even this is UNknown cheap
if you have money give it to me and i UNknown l pay you back in a week adding ten percent to it
if you want we UNknown l buy together
you UNknown e squandered away all your money this way
i don 't have any money
you UNknown l regret it
just let me get the money
what 's up selim ?
you keep closing shop and going off these days
i 'm going out to purchase new merchandise or something
by the way is there any news ?
the robber helper of yours
can 't you be a little more careful ?
you can 't hold a plate properly
you have no bill sir
no bring me the bill !
no sir i swear i won 't !
i said bring the bill !
i UNknown l have it exchanged
there are so many fake dollars
oh of course please !
don 't mention it !
what brand would you like ?
i don 't know a good one
this doesn 't rub off
not even when you kiss
do you have a red one ?
do you want a flashy lipstick ?
do you like it ?
it 's supposed to stay on
okay i agree with you
let 's not pay rent anymore
why should we buy this flat ?
it 's been our home for years
it 's a good place
the neighborhood is getting very expensive
if not this one another place
the thing is to stop paying rent
i 'm saying let 's buy a flat
but why are we buying this one ?
why don 't we buy a better one ?
don 't we deserve a better one ?
look at you you UNknown e always said we can 't buy let 's not buy and now you look down on this flat !
i wouldn 't mind i wish we could !
selim you 'r e funny
did you inquire about the loan ?
no i just thought about it
thought and made a decision
selim are you joking honey ?
weren 't you the one who was always saying i can 't go into that kind of commitment ? what about money ?
he must have taken care of that loan
we UNknown l take care of it
we UNknown l take care of that too
the time will come for that too !
the last time you bought me a present was when UNknown was born
you 'r e still doing the dishes by hand
selim we shouldn 't overdo it
you always say 'm UNknown isn 't easy to earn
the money belongs to all of us !
i UNknown e brought the linen
he also said to tell you not to UNknown away too much money
he meant it as a joke
would you like some dessert ?
have you got rice pudding ?
but let me get you the menu
why are you loafing here at this hour ?
i 'm taking a walk to digest it
i saw these leather UNknown and stopped
UNknown has been talking about a new couch
leather UNknown cost a fortune man
where will you get all that money ?
actually leather is so UNknown it 's like an investment
considering a couch an investment proves you 'r e a bad UNknown
what 's a good UNknown doing here ?
you 'r e right actually
but you know i 'm sick and tired of it
i don 't feel like staying in the shop
somebody you can trust a proper experienced person
let him take care of the shop
well anyway that 's harder for me
what about those paintings ?
are they still for sale ?
selim are you serious ?
i 'm sure they are
i thought you didn 't have any money
i received a large payment
check it out if you like we UNknown l go together to look at them one day
so you 'r e coming tonight ?
one thing nobody should know about the paintings
a dishwasher 's so practical
you did well to buy one
that 's best if you UNknown e got money
in a country where the inflation rate is so high it 's best to be in debt
why if you have money ?
to earn more money with money
you say if you have money that 's such a weird thing
you can 't spend it
i mean not like you want because it 's always for something
well that 's not having money
if you ask me you pay your rent you provide food then the rest you should spend
money that 's spent doesn 't bring pleasure
and then there 's spending and spending
you UNknown l spend it for your pleasures
i UNknown l spend it by UNknown
i UNknown l buy a house some land
we mean different things by spending
i think that has to do with how the money is earned
it 's easy to spend money that 's earned easily
there 's spending the money you saved and spending the money you got from the lottery
that 's what you think until you hit the lottery
after you put the money in your pocket it 's as difficult to spend as the money you UNknown e saved
now UNknown is not the type to spend easily
well of course there are limits
UNknown spends as he likes when he has money
the thing is not to be miserable for money
won 't we all end up in the same place ?
is it worth it ?
it certainly isn 't !
you 'r e absolutely correct pal
you know selim something has come over you
you 'r e more relaxed easier
i think because you understand that money that 's spent feels better
he realized that he won 't become rich some day
how can a UNknown be so weird ?
the year we got UNknown at UNknown gen
the year twenty years now right selim ?
selim is playing right back
i 'm at left field
we 'r e playing against UNknown
the score is 2 2
selim steps into the penalty area and falls down
the referee whistles for penalty
so he gets up he isn 't hurt but he 's pulling this long face !
he says 'i fell down on my own
i say quietly but the referee called a penalty
but i fell down on my own he says again
UNknown the bear is getting ready for the penalty kick
he heard what selim said
he whispered 's hut up in his ear UNknown
i tried to take this guy aside but he walked right up to the referee
selim said softly 'i fell down on my own
the referee looked at him pretended not to hear and went ahead with the penalty kick
UNknown the bear kicked that ball so hard
the ball went over and out and the game ended up 3 3
so UNknown the bear came and slapped selim in the face real hard
i never knew this !
i can 't believe you played soccer anyway
it 's not like you at all
but what he did there i don 't know if it 's being honest or rather stupid
UNknown made you pay for the goal he missed
this man 's weird that 's it
but we had a lot of fun
you were a little embarrassed too weren 't you because we UNknown e spent so much lately ?
we 'r e going to purchase a house
if only they knew !
i mean business is going very well lately
so we started to spend a lot on everything compared to before
it 's nothing to be embarrassed about
but confess that you were
that 's why you said you bought the tv on installment
actually you paid for it in advance didn 't you ?
well that 's not being dishonest
UNknown is in favor of buying everything on installment
i said it so he wouldn 't start preaching again
i didn 't say it was dishonest honey !
can anybody be as honest as you ?
come on let 's go to sleep
my purse is gone !
where can it be ?
they UNknown e stolen it right now !
calm down ma 'a m !
i just checked it a minute ago
it happened this minute !
call the person in charge
please all of you stay inside
the police will conduct a search at the first stop
lady there 's something under that seat
oh it 's my purse !
is it all there ?
be sure about yourself before you blame others
how can a purse drop off from a closed handbag ?
even if it did how did it get so far ?
if it 's so valuable keep your eye on it !
how do i know you didn 't take it and throw it away ?
officer i 'd like to make a complaint about this woman !
she calls all these people 't UNknown
aren 't you ashamed to accuse these honest working people ?
lady you found your purse so you leave it at that too
okay folks curfew is over !
the paintings are still there
nobody 's onto the fortune lying there
you 'r e not very cheerful either
are you going to buy the paintings ?
aren 't we buying them together ?
have you changed your mind ?
let 's go look at them if you like
are you out of money ?
there 's no money problem
i don 't know if you want to
we can wait till lunch hour
i was going to close any way
what do you say ?
he was an incredible painter
can you see the UNknown of that dark ?
you 'r e okay aren 't you ?
are you buying them ?
you UNknown e bought two fine paintings if you ask me
but this is all it 's worth
maybe some amateur would be willing to pay a little more
what i mean is don 't expect too much
the man is obviously a good businessman
why do you say he 's a merchant ?
it 's evident from the brush strokes that it 's mass production
but paintings made for sale don 't bring in as much money as the ones that weren 't painted for money
i don 't think these paintings were made like that
well if i say more you UNknown l raise the price
no i 'm just asking what they 'r e worth
the kitchen fuse went off
my brother 's not home
mother and i don 't know what to do
there 's some stuff in this box
would you mind looking ?
i liked your shop a lot
i UNknown l come again
my mother liked the shirt too
you went to a lot of trouble
won 't you come in ?
selim honey it 's past eight
you UNknown l miss the boat
but otherwise it 's even more difficult
i UNknown l open the shop half an hour later then
no customers that early anyway
i think we need a car anyway
i don 't believe this
last year we didn 't talk to each other for a week because of this
you said what do we need a car for ?
will you exchange this ?
selim how our life has changed
it 's so nice !
i want to say something but don 't get mad
just so i UNknown l feel confident
why are we spending so much money ?
rather how can we ?
it 's a lot of money
we 'r e spending it
it 's impossible to talk to you
we 'r e still what we were
i didn 't think then that we could afford to live like this
what do you mean ?
you either have money or you don 't
let 's say i UNknown e received all payments at once
you 'r e a UNknown
how can people owe you ?
did you loan somebody money ?
why are you so curious ?
i 'm really very happy
but there 's this UNknown i feel
i 'm scared that it might be temporary
i showed them to three people
all of them said the paintings were very recent
the worst part is one of them said these paintings were made by that old antique dealer himself !
let 's take them back
i UNknown l go and bring down his shop
let 's take them back
he won 't take them back
he didn 't say they were old
it 's you who said that
but still he said russian
did he say i paint this rubbish my self ?
the guy tried to warn us
it 's none of your fault
all the fault is mine
well i UNknown l go to his shop and take it down
i UNknown l take the police there
don 't bring the police into this
once he sees the police even the tv cameras he UNknown l know
getting angry won 't help you
let 's go together and have a talk
you are an antiques dealer
the stuff you sell has got to be old
everything we sell is old
your paintings are worth what you paid for them
i had already told you that you might not get anything higher
we 'r e returning them
we want our money back
we don 't accept returns
you can only sell the paintings back
that 's all i can do
it comes to the same thing
but i 'm a second hand dealer
i buy things for much less than their worth
meaning i UNknown l buy them back for one third of the price you paid for them
it 's the basic rule for second hand trade
buying old things at junk price selling them at their worth to amateurs
that 's how i make my living
there 's no crime in it
what if i told you i knew the painter ?
that won 't make any difference
isn 't it a crime to sell your paintings as antiques ?
i didn 't sell you any antiques
i sold you two paintings
it 's not worth this many tricks
you will pay for it
so where 's the studio ?
where 's your antique workshop ?
okay UNknown stop it let 's go
you know what i like those paintings
i UNknown l keep them
don 't worry about the money
we caught that helper of yours
i called the police right away
he was just passing by here
mr selim say something please
shut up or i UNknown l
mr selim tell them for heaven 's sake !
they say i robbed you with a gun !
is this the person who robbed your shop ?
what did i ever do to you ?
what you did is worse than theft you son of a bitch robbing the person who fed you !
was it him who robbed you ?
mr selim for god 's sake it 's a sin
i didn 't do it
well what 's done is done
if it was armed robbery it 's not enough for you to pardon him
let 's go to the station
you will tell us there
please give a detailed account
it 's just like i told you
how were you robbed ?
you talk as if you 'r e not sure
did he have a gun ?
we will make a report
first of all tell me this
mr selim why do you lie ?
go and ask my family !
i wasn 't even in istanbul after i was dismissed
after i dismissed him one day he came to the shop and robbed it
did he have a gun ?
did you see it ?
mr selim here told me
did he have a gun ?
i 'm not making a complaint
if it 's armed robbery it makes no difference if you make a complaint
plus if he had a gun how can you not remember ?
selim why don 't you say it ?
he robbed me holding a gun
i guess it 's new
i wish father was with us
actually it 's fun to go on vacation like this as if we 'r e running away
especially when you UNknown e got a car
why should we run away ?
mom look at the lambs !
well did you decide where we 'r e going ?
the shop will be closed for two days
crazy beasts they are !
they 'r e all killers
they 'd poke your eye out
they 'r e fighting UNknown
i 'm a rooster engineer
people all around up to UNknown know me
ask and they UNknown l tell you
ask if they know ali the blind rooster guy
i not only train them i do the operations too
the salt and pepper one here i UNknown his UNknown yesterday
why do the UNknown fight ?
it 's a sports for UNknown
for money my girl money
there 's big money in this
do the UNknown get the money ?
what should a rooster do with money ?
daddy what does forgery mean ?
UNknown please give me that
daddy what does forgery mean ?
it 's making false money
how do they make it false ?
they make something that resembles money
why do they make it ?
is there a tire repair shop close by ?
right after the first village
the animals got a disease
we sold these before they got it too
sold them at a loss
no to the sausage factory
our sheep aren 't sick yet
but they pay less than the price of sick sheep
i swear we sell them for the price of dead sheep
daddy why will they cut the lambs ?
UNknown you ask so many things !
come on we 'r e going
you 'r e worried about something
we can go back if you 'd like
i UNknown l go check to see if the newspapers have arrived
a corpse found two days ago near the UNknown y wharf has been identified as a r 37 the cashier who ran away with 450 000 dollars last month
the autopsy report points to the probability of suicide
bad news in the paper selim ?
we can 't take him
they beat me and beat me
how did you get me out ?
but i 'm not guilty
what did i ever do to you ?
and then you UNknown l have me caught for stealing it !
i don 't want it !
this is your share of the robbery
forget me and what happened
and don 't pass by the shop again
i always feel like i 'm using you
i always feel guilty towards you
UNknown says these paintings scare me in the night
the UNknown antique dealer had to teach us a lesson too
it doesn 't look like you learned your lesson
you obviously have a new project in mind
yes i have a new project !
but this time i don 't think you UNknown l be interested in the least because it 's a project for making big money
it 's not for someone broke like you
i UNknown e had enough
i want to make money too
i 'm going into the historical objects business
don 't you protest selim
i UNknown e made up my mind
there 's not much difference between that and antiques anyway
i know you UNknown l say this is outright theft
it 's just turning an UNknown object into a trade object
and no harm is done to the historical object
it may be against the law but it 's not a sin
what 's the difference ?
what 's the difference ?
a tombstone more a tombstone less
what difference does that make ?
don 't you try bringing me in on this
i already told you it 's not for you
i just wanted you to know
i 'd like a short UNknown white shirt
but it has to have an UNknown collar
unfortunately this is the only one we have
how much is it ?
how long till you 'r e discharged ?
two and a half months
one of those who UNknown l get you one day
don 't worry i UNknown l be okay
smugglers always live by turning each other in you know that
you can 't make money if you don 't take risks
i thought i 'd take a look at the shops
but everything 's so expensive i just looked
can 't you see the price tag ?
it didn 't fit me
the gentleman said it did
people have got fine brothers !
i UNknown e got four
all they know is to beat me
he 's just a rich guy she 's ripping off
that means the guy is married and she knows his wife
even so i 'm very embarrassed
do you sell UNknown ?
selim these are worth a fortune !
daddy let 's go to the park
you don 't do exercises with me anymore either !
i 'm very tired sweetheart
today my stomach hurts too
i probably couldn 't digest my lunch
how did you buy these ?
i UNknown l tell you a secret
but even my father shouldn 't know okay ?
i UNknown e been wanting to tell you but i couldn 't find the opportunity let 's say
a while ago i hit the lottery
but you never play the lottery !
well the one time that i did i got lucky
it 's not something to be sad about
why aren 't you glad ?
i bought you jewels and you 'r e questioning me
selim it 's true isn 't it ?
i kept it secret because
you 'r e right honey
they wouldn 't leave you alone
that 's why you were tense then !
you 'r e such a patient man
i couldn 't have kept it
let 's buy a flat first thing
we shouldn 't UNknown away that money
where 's the money ?
something 's bothering you about this money selim !
why should anything bother me ?
you want to spend it all and finish it
you want to get rid of it
i UNknown l help you do that !
to the island don 't you remember ?
selim please come with us !
i have to make the inventory in the shop
you 'r e a lucky man selim !
i 'm a lucky woman !

did you take the thermos ?
i can drive you to the wharf if you 'd like
we UNknown l take a cab
we won 't worry about the cab fare !
you scared me selim !
i brought you your electricity bill
you were going out i guess
so UNknown is not home ?
they went to the island
why didn 't you go with them ?
the island is so nice in this season
well don 't let me keep you
i hadn 't seen this couch
did they go to b y UNknown ?
i UNknown l go now
selim thank you for the dress
one would think they were always on time !
this is the communist UNknown
who did i promise a pork leg to ?
and this other one 's for juan
i UNknown l cook that one
juan my love give me the pork leg
dad what 's the matter with you ?
kids take your pork leg carefully
we 'r e all going to eat it anyway
stop there boy that animal 's already dead
i said a few little holes
watch how it 's done
you take a few olives a few capers
you take four UNknown you put one two and the other two you eat
you must season it each hour so that it 's tasty
UNknown is the most important thing when cooking a pork leg
if not it tastes as if you 'r e eating fish
what 's wrong UNknown ?
you 'r e talking to yourself
i UNknown e told you that 's called praying
leave the table cloth alone
where 's this fabric from ?
i UNknown e told you already
this is a piece of fabric from your mom 's dress
is it true that you 'r e crazy ?
what do crazy people do ?
when they 'r e sad
tell them the snowman 's going to melt
grandma don 't call me that
don 't open your eyes
you are not my dad
what 's your name ?
let 's go to your grandma 's quickly
no grandma 's not crazy
UNknown what are you doing here ?
i already gave you your pork leg
shouldn 't you be at grandma 's ?
is she gone again ?
no she 's talking to herself and says that birds no longer fly
we were surrounded and they killed many of us
what have you heard from your brother ?
the last time i saw him he told me he was coming to see the kid
isn 't your pork leg alive and kicking ?
go shower i will take care of it
he 's gone home already
and the other UNknown ?
it 's such a great costume you can 't even see it
the first roast arrives !
very good but you didn 't cook it
yes of course i did !
you have to put your name on it so that everyone knows
the second roast arrives !
what are you kids doing ?
UNknown stay away from foolishness
kids come and see your present
daughter each day you 'r e prettier
dad don 't say things like that in front of your UNknown
mom has such a nice kitchen imported white and pretty
just as she always wanted
but it 's out in the patio gathering dirt
at least she made the pork roast today
no don 't do that
military men don 't think
but mom look at you !
and look at the time
are you a hair dresser now ?
we 'r e going to pick the best roast
the biggest ear is best !
the winners are the four ears !
who votes for this one ?
there 's a tie and delia must break it
i vote for UNknown 's
it 's almost midnight !
my grandpa 's not here !
dad you cannot keep messing with another 's wife
can you see me ?
UNknown it 's me raul
what 's happening raul ?
they 'r e killing me
each time it 's worse
i can 't take it anymore
did you rat on me raul ?
i 'm going to kill you raul
that 's what they told me that they 'd place us together so that you 'd kill me
how do i get out of here ?
how do i get out of here ?
if you survive you UNknown l end up in a hospital and it 's easier to get out of there
well fear is always there
fear is part of who you are nevertheless i 'm not frightened of torture
when policemen torture somebody they know that if someone betrays another they can humiliate him because he loses his morals his ethics
and that 's the only thing we have left
of course i 'm afraid of being tortured and all that crap but the truth is what i fear the most is running out of our sardine supply
what are we supposed to do if we run out of food ?
comrade the only one who eats sardines while hiding in the mountain is you
comrade you ratted on me
let 's do it again
have you betrayed anyone ?
someone came to see you
the party has sent me
why didn 't you tell her about the weapons ?
i had no idea who she even was
from now on you do exactly what i say
we 'r e also UNknown a war in here with dead and missing people
anyone can be weak and betray us
who ratted on you ?
our priority is to flee to run away they 'r e running away in other prisons therefore our duty is to run away also
i 'm even a frog man
gringo what type of music are you going to add on to it ?
i should leave to go get the weapons
i 'd prefer doing that rather than follow the gringo around with his camera
UNknown that is also important we can 't remain isolated
some military men will join us and we UNknown l become a civic military army
are we going to take orders from them ?
gringo you left us there
we 'r e doing badly but with military men one never really knows
besides we won 't be able to mention lenin or marx
we 'r e going to have to speak more of UNknown
and what are the russian comrades going to say ?
if any russian ever comes all the way up here we just tell him what happened
i need to see your superior !
you 'r e alive because we caught you inside a house because if we had done so in the mountain you 'd be sliced open like a goat
i UNknown e done nothing
i simply went out to play a baseball game and on my way over there those military men seized me
we UNknown e created a civic military army in order to confront the situation
we 'r e also UNknown a war in here with dead and missing people
if we 'r e not on the look out anyone can be weak and betray us
that 's why we decided in the assembly that you are going to rat on me
that i 'm here for the kennedy case
who would UNknown e thought that two years after john f kennedy 's death we 'd continue to miss him so dearly ?
good afternoon friends my friends
welcome to your miss mayo program
today believe it or not we can 't eat our first recipe
have you noticed my hair 's beautiful shine ?
i also achieve that with UNknown
for your hair 's beauty UNknown it with UNknown length and UNknown wise using a UNknown
place a cap on for twenty minutes and i guarantee you UNknown l have a fabulous mane
your cousin 's looking for you
i can 't i must wrap up my program
you are not at risk but someone 's ratted on us
they 'r e looking for each one of us
if this fails to arrive many will die
you must get up to here leave the car on the corner and the key in the glare flap
can 't that gringo ever stop ?
it 's safe to surround this area but it UNknown l take two more days
the army is UNknown this way and is coming closer
it 's best to cancel our UNknown vous with the other UNknown
this is a propaganda maneuver what really matters is that the gringo UNknown it on film
go and inform the other UNknown and you two head for the hamlet
i didn 't know you were so fond of oranges
seemingly i 'm going to inherit mom 's illness
i don 't want it
your roast was very pretty
no it wasn 't me
are you going to stay here forever ?
there 's a plan and it 's like a game
this shirt always gets dirty !
it 's always filthy !
wash it and take the tag of
wash it and take the tag of
i 'm going to defend you because you have your rights
i UNknown e studied your case and i can get you out of here
stay as strong as you UNknown e always been
don 't let them drive you insane
are you getting me out of here ?
i want that glass the glass
what are you doing ?
where did you get this glass ?
i allowed them to beat me up
when i leave this place they can continue beating me up
they say you 'r e pretending to be crazy that you 'r e going to betray us
but you killed him then cooked him and were about to eat him
but only so that it looked nice
but you stole him !
even if you are my loving brother i cannot understand your revolution which leaves my children without food on new year 's eve
we want you to sign a statement where you confess to stealing pedro
i raised pedro so i 'm warning you
you must submit to popular demand
you must hand in the fish
don 't trust nobody only your family
gringo are you ok ?
is that a real baby ?
you were supposed to be here earlier
i wasn 't able to
do you feel anything ?
you are already about three months pregnant aren 't you ?
what did the doctor say ?
you must take good care of yourself
have you heard from UNknown ?
he was in jail but he was able to get out
how can i find out about him ?
marta is the contact with our comrades in jail she 's the leader of the university 's lady 's committee
she 's the one who came from the mountain and will be taking the money
but she 's just a child
she 's been in the mountain for a pretty long time
what do you prefer ?
short or long weapons ?
we have a UNknown study group
where do you keep your weapon when you sleep ?
our comrades who returned from moscow have cleared up a few issues
my name is miss mayo
they UNknown e murdered the little girl !
miss those things on the radio are never true
here do your own make up before one of these lunatics comes to torture you
is it true you are pregnant ?
do you know how dangerous that is ?
this was left by a comrade
she also came from the mountain
did anything happen to her ?
i don 't think so
what 's wrong with you UNknown ?
that couldn 't be true
she was going that way
i 'm not making anything up
her dress was the same as this
once i spent the entire evening surrounded by the army
they UNknown e lost a little box with things that blow up
i buried them three steps away from the bushes
i had no idea and i cut them down
i UNknown l take care of you
i won 't allow anything to happen to you
marta i need to ask you something
five of you go to this hallway
the other four ; here
i 'm going in through the elevator
i UNknown l exit the elevator
when i arrive here which is the area where the registers are placed you will wait for me to give the signal
do you remember the signal ?
UNknown and fer open their UNknown and we put the money away
i know you know something about UNknown
what happened to him ?
UNknown was released from jail and now he 's in the sanatorium
the medical counsel will evaluate you
if you don 't have any psychiatric disorders they UNknown l throw you back in jail
therefore it 's better if i examine you first
mom and if they kill you what should i do ?
was it my dad ?
was it my uncle ?
no it was someone i didn 't know
so why did you cry ?
because if they think it 's your dad they won 't look for him anymore
are we coming tomorrow again ?
you can 't go back to jail
and the trials last ten minutes
i UNknown l be waiting for you
when you fall bend your knees
they UNknown e killed your brother
you UNknown e told me already
what are you going to tell him ?
once again he will receive postcards from leningrad
UNknown you UNknown e been UNknown from the political charges
nevertheless i must remain here
UNknown say good bye to your uncle and your grandma
can 't we stay here ?
children shouldn 't be here
you 'r e going to become a dad
you UNknown e told me already
what name are we going to give it ?
can his name be UNknown ?
the crazy one 's not coming
don 't call your uncle that way
can 't you sleep ?
i need to run away now but i UNknown l come back for you
don 't worry about me
i UNknown l wait here just in case you come back
is this road taking us to the sea ?
they looked like angels from heaven
but my neighbor said they just came from UNknown
whenever i had food i 'd give them some
if i didn 't i wouldn 't
food was very expensive back then
they said things would change that the world would be a better place
they left in the middle of the night
we never saw them again
the last time i saw them walk by was in 66 or UNknown 9
they came and took over 3 UNknown aside from this one
and i really don 't know why they never came back

alexander UNknown sergei UNknown present a film by fyodor UNknown
he meets the UNknown UNknown and his sister UNknown
but his friendship and love bring them no joy
their people are UNknown control of rays transmitted by towers and mobile units
the invisible rays sap their will and make them believe anything
some people aren 't affected
they 'r e called freaks
when the UNknown are on high the freaks are in unbearable pain
the leaders call themselves the unknown fathers
they are all freaks for whom the rays are weapons of power and torture
the freaks not in power are considered enemies
they are identified persecuted tried and executed in 48 hours
the rays don 't affect maxim either way
he 's powerful and physically developed
on 22nd century earth people have learned how to use the hidden resources of the body
the unknown fathers are preparing to attack a UNknown state
two competing groups know about maxim 's abilities
UNknown head of the special research department
and genius the state prosecutor
where is he from ?
they both need him for different reasons
why do you want him ?
a UNknown for our research
to survive save his friend and lover
maxim plans to destroy the ray transmission system
lmagine how many towers are all UNknown country !
how many are built every day !
he can 't find allies in the country
the freaks are too weak UNknown scared
ls the real purpose of the towers hidden from the underground ?
most of the conspirators want to take power and use the towers UNknown own purposes
so max takes UNknown in a stolen tank and breaks through the army lines
he decides to find allies beyond the borders among the UNknown and enemies
UNknown lsland the UNknown battle
you jerk listen to me
those aren 't UNknown UNknown towers
they 'r e for people like you
they produce rays that make you believe everything
so you believe the tv newspaper captain UNknown
you 'r e a puppet in their hands
you 'r e affected by the rays
you don 't notice it
you 'r e a puppet
your passion is from the rays
freaks are people who aren 't affected
the rays cause them pain
UNknown all of the unknown fathers are freaks
it 's ten o UNknown lock
what happens in the barracks ?
you passionately sing the anthem ?
passion is in our blood
that passion is UNknown into UNknown skulls !
sing the guard march !
the guards march forth with heavy tread
to take the fort their eyes blood red
what 'r e you give it !
UNknown line camp said a corporal was taken
UNknown are always taking someone
it 's the south after all
the commander 's report mentioned a UNknown tank
get me the report of that UNknown commander
and tell them to bring more of this medicinal stuff
our handsome fellow is alive
what else could you be ?
get your stuff and let 's go
stop it they 'r e nice people
the prince wants you to stay
he 's ready to die and wants a real man to replace him
what do you say ?
me a real man ?
you 'r e a real man
and not the only one there are UNknown million
it will be contaminated for 200 years
half my life as a puppet
we UNknown e gathered to discuss UNknown mak 's proposal
perhaps this will decide UNknown
have a cup of something
i don 't want to
the soldiers are pushing us into the desert
ln 10 15 years we UNknown l be in the desert and die there
UNknown mak first wanted to arm us and lead us into battle
but he saw that we are weak
then he decided to go to the desert UNknown make a deal with them and lead them against the soldiers
he needs us to let the dessert people through our land and give them food while the war is on
that 's why we have gathered
i don 't get it
he wants barbarians to come ?
they UNknown l kill us all !
they UNknown l come in peace or not at all
better not to deal with the barbarians
you think i don 't know ?
even the soldiers are better
that 's true of course
but the barbarians might push out the soldiers and leave us
for ages they kill us and now they won 't ?
nothing will come of this
they UNknown l kill him and us too
we don 't need this
let us die in peace
you hate soldiers and want to destroy them
we don 't want revenge
he 's a soldier too
since when do soldiers pity us ?
he wants the best for us and to destroy our enemies
no it 's not for us mak
i didn 't do anything
really maybe mak can make a deal with the sorcerer
UNknown the tea is good
don 't go to the sorcerer
don 't even think about it
ln general these places are
did you UNknown children are taken at night ?
but no one enters the houses
or better leave it here
or UNknown to stay here
why are you doing this ?
what can the UNknown you ?
the world is in balance maxim
you asked the UNknown for help the most pathetic and unfortunate people who UNknown burden of this balance
but they didn 't want to change anything
because people should be free
who are you to decide UNknown ?
UNknown do you like your new freedom ?
maxim your reason is UNknown by conscience and unable to distinguish true good from imagined good
which reason seeks means to achieve ?
and then the ideals must be UNknown or conscience UNknown
since UNknown can 't destroy from within attack from without
UNknown the barbarians so the UNknown die and the blue snake river be filled with bodies
let a huge war begin !
so said your conscience UNknown
i must compromise for such a goal
what choice do i have ?
there are forty million beyond the blue snake
they 'r e walking corpses
you are a force maxim
that you are here means the balance of our little world is shattered
i don 't know about your world but in ours such force always has a master
try to contact the lsland empire
that is all you wished to know
first i don 't advise you head into the desert
you won 't find anything there
maybe you should follow the sorcerer 's advice and contact the UNknown ?
the lsland empire the white submarine
i UNknown e heard about them
so where will you go mak ?
ls the sea far ?
it 's through contaminated land
here to the south border
UNknown is UNknown by two lines of towers
this is the mountain eagle
the bomber of his majesty UNknown the first of four gold banners
they would make soldiers recite
private so and so !
name the private bomber of his lmperial majesty !
at first i wanted to evacuate wounded on it but there were too many
there 's enough fuel to cross the planet
well then my dears fly away
mak have you ever flown something like this ?
but i UNknown e flown others
my liege my leader !
throw me in the fire
i UNknown l throw myself at the guns
i UNknown l UNknown a part i UNknown l rip out UNknown
what 's wrong with you ?
i want to die foryou
i want to die foryou
to go down in blazes
to go down in blazes
are you nuts ? ldiot !
yes i 'm an idiot !
but i 'm your idiot !
it 's the tower !
the monster fathers dog fathers put up those towers !
knock out the towers !
and with heavy tread to take the fort eyes blood red !
drive your machine into that tower
i UNknown l jump with a bomb !
i UNknown l jump !
i won 't miss !
did i do something ?
we got hit by rays
what can i do ?
they should have flown their bomber
the lsland empire is too UNknown walk to right ?
what 's the plan ?
you are being detained by order of the prosecutor
lf a patrol catches us say that freaks got me
you chased them and rescued me
at least they won 't kill us right away on the spot
i won 't let anyone kill me again
washed into the bay by a storm and run aground
he served in the coast guards
well he said weird sailors served on those submarines
there are legends about them
you can 't go on board
you stay and i UNknown l go see
not a pretty sight is it ?
he doesn 't want to kill
during the UNknown l had the feeling that i was UNknown a child
he 's not like us
it 's like he 's from another world
did he say he was from the hills ?
tell about his customs ?
how things are there in the hills ?
they have clean rivers and seas
and he told about the world
they think the world is the other way around
we don 't live on the inside of the sphere but the outside
and the sphere kind of floats in space
UNknown that 's the world lnside out theory
now why would such a man get involved with freaks knock out towers and kill people ?
they said the towers UNknown rays
crazy people say they are hit by rays
he 's alive isn 't he ?
yes i think so yes
and i think that very soon we UNknown l meet him
i 'd also like to know about the inside out world
i need to find a common language with him
i hope you UNknown l help me
i won 't help you
you couldn 't reply ?
our intelligence operated like clockwork
mak did you see that ?
what 's wrong with them ?
you were going to make a deal with them ?
i don 't want anything
and stop yelling at me !
you 'r e to blame UNknown !
you destroyed and robbed and turned into beasts
i can 't bring in anyone
shoot in the air quick !
the story is that you were taken by the UNknown and i saved you
so we go back to the rays ?
it won 't be like before
not good but UNknown it was
why do you need this ?
on the radio they said war has begun
we attacked the UNknown UNknown attacked us
damn you all to hell !
amnesty and everyone to the front
criminals political and military prisoners
you 'r e in a penal brigade
we need to get in the same brigade
what 's your unit ?
second penal brigade unit four
then i save you and UNknown
where 's the bitch going ?
you 'r e a brave girl
my brother is a corporal in penal brigade two
so UNknown UNknown has been taken from the state prosecutor and is with us in our crystal swan complex totally isolated from the world
mak has to be here on my return
let him know very UNknown
give him a job and put him to work
to leave at such a time
you 'r e free to go
and why do you want him ?
i 'm afraid of him
he 's a very very dangerous man
you 'r e alive !
i 'm not wrong !
i address you as soldiers
although you 'r e still just the crap of society
we UNknown l see you in battle today
the fathers send you into battle
almost all of you will die
and that will be good
but those of you UNknown who survive will life a good life
there 's no way back but there 's a way UNknown
they UNknown l all die or redeem themselves
and on your department !
i UNknown l kill every UNknown
they know they 'r e going to die but they go anyway
herd instinct mak doesn 't rule out personal hope
i UNknown l hide behind a hill
i UNknown l hit the dirt during the attack
what were you thinking ?
you should have done something !
not hitting towers but telling the truth about the rays !
your whole underground wasn 't worth a damn
i wouldn 't say no to some grub
i suggest that you be kind to us and refrain from such commentary
there they are ours coffins
see what they give us
will we really die here ?
how UNknown the border ?
then hills to the dessert
i don 't think so
it UNknown l be fine
just listen only to me
don 't listen to anyone else
ahead to the enemy !
listen only to me !
don 't you recognize me ?
there are four of us
i can 't go alone
you want to die ?
i UNknown l tell you later
he 's with you ?
i UNknown l die foryou !
let me die foryou !
i UNknown l die foryou !
let me die foryou !
i UNknown l die foryou !
our best friends got it ?
i did it all !
you said no shots to the head ?
too bad i didn 't give you to the department
you signed your death sentences
you killed the commander of a special tank brigade
you UNknown l all be killed
lf you want to stay alive i UNknown l get you out
mr maxim does UNknown UNknown 's fate still interest you ?
you must mr state prosecutor
latest news from the front
i hope you are UNknown by the fact that his sister is absolutely safe
like you and your convict friends
am i under arrest ?
not at all you 'r e free
you have an apartment on the UNknown grounds
i want to see her
we set the terms here
i warned you not to get into this mess
you 'r e a civilian not a military man
what was that saying ?
then how does it go ?
why are you silent ?
some have had it worse than this
mak UNknown can be found at the special research UNknown
he 's division head in the chemical UNknown lab
let 's not be formal
i need to see all the department 's staff
i UNknown l see you soon
you 'r e making no progress
ln physical defense you UNknown e done nothing at all
he didn 't leave a number
do you know where he is ?
where does he go ?
you know UNknown take me to the laboratory
to the palace hospital fast
that 's what military adventures can lead to
i 'm the state prosecutor
trusted agent of the state with access to the highest state secrets
i propose that you overthrow the unknown fathers
i know where the center is
the center of the tower system
and you are the only person who can seize it
you get in and first of all change the rays to a depression field
people will fall into depression
no one will be able to do anything
while the entire country is UNknown in depression and the freaks reel UNknown rays you get into the radio station
you broadcast on UNknown cycle this UNknown
it 's all very easy
the unknown fathers are criminals
kill them and you save the country
then you stop the depression field
and you become the head of state
and i stay UNknown as your political and economic advisor
but that 's not all
keep in mind that when you seize the center you UNknown l destroy the person who is trying to UNknown you
who controls the fate of UNknown UNknown
the end of the fathers is the end of UNknown
do you know where she is ?
it 's at the special research department
someone told the UNknown to shoot the tank barriers
last night they took out 90 percent of the UNknown
it 's the end of the war and the end for many of us
what do you think genius ?
you 'r e our genius
UNknown won 't have any UNknown UNknown !
i UNknown l go in
lf you get hit by the rays at that time you can faint with a smile on UNknown
lf not there 's a UNknown bomb in the trunk
put the bomb on the street
turn it on and drive away
use it as much as you can
mak let me make some calls
UNknown and i have a group
when i go in the building
you can get out and call
take the stairs down !
get UNknown out of here before i kill them
mak who is this ?
you are UNknown UNknown UNknown boar
and you are professor UNknown UNknown
i UNknown l explain later
ls the center really gone ?
what can we do now ?
tell me who you are !
i came here from earth 20 years ago !
to prepare this poor little planet for salvation in keeping with their UNknown
who are you to stick your nose in shoot and blow things up ?
i didn 't know !
'd UNknown 't know ! ldiot !
what should we do now ?
we 'r e too late
what did you do ? !
i didn 't catch you
do you know what to do ?
they UNknown l see they were lied to
who will rise up ?
where will they rise to ?
what were you thinking ?
the unknown fathers are alive and well
there 's a war we 'r e losing
but the center is gone !
how about the mobile units ?
do you know there will be a famine ?
you stupid kid did you know the lsland empire is about to attack ?
today you fly back to earth
i may be a fool
how could you allow this ?
how could you do all this ?
war towers battles tanks UNknown !
by the laws of history
it 's their world their history
we can 't change anything
you don 't understand anything
go home you UNknown nose kid
i UNknown l sink submarines
i UNknown l fight inflation if i have to
as long as i 'm alive as long as i 'm alive you hear me ?
i don 't regret it
and i will never regret it
you have to make good from evil
there 's nothing else to make it from
screenplay marina and sergei UNknown
director of photography maxim UNknown UNknown
first assistant director boris UNknown
i bumped into a sliding door
looks worse than it is
why does it keep happening to you ?
what 's that supposed to mean ?
it was a UNknown week too
this was a sliding door karin
it happens to us active types
actually a funny thing happened
i 'm building a tool shed of UNknown and i trip in the hood of my UNknown that i had taken off for lunch
then i smacked my head on the concrete base of the parasol
i thought that maybe you had some lotion
maybe some really great new stuff ?
l UNknown l have a look
it goes 3 5 9
that 's how it 's always been done
no reason to change it
otherwise apply for art school
what 's the UNknown line motto ?
and what time is that ?
i had to take my mom to the hospital
she had a seizure again
and the doctors were late
so that 's your excuse ?
UNknown it 's not really an excuse
i 'm responsible for feeding the guests on this ship
some have to visit family in UNknown others transfer in norway and some are just eager to get home
sorry but i would be a lousy manager if i didn 't dismiss you
you can 't do that
i hurried as much as i could
anna sugar from the restaurant ?
now you leave me no choice
pack up your locker and leave
that 's a no no
you can 't eat another person 's buffet fries
the one who pays eats
you want me to give it a rest ? !
she says she 's not very hungry
i specifically UNknown that the shrimp sandwich was UNknown UNknown
i gave her a chance but she chose to ignore it
yes maybe it 's funny but you UNknown l be charged for two buffet meals
otherwise i UNknown l call the police
you want me to call the police ?
is there a problem ?
no why should there be a problem ?
you know i don 't want to pry
UNknown lines will help you if you have any problems
i 'm really glad to UNknown eric
but i have no problems what so ever
UNknown UNknown like everyone else
but nothing i would bother the management with
you can 't call the police like that
you scare off the customers
they broke the buffet rule eric
it was a couple of fries
but where do we draw the line ?
try to UNknown the situation
i UNknown that the shrimp sandwich was tiny but the woman ignored me
what 's the deal with anna ?
why did you fire her ?
she says she 's been late twice and only by a few minutes
and i deeply regret not taking action before eric
but that 's my fault entirely
that 's my big flaw
i found an eight UNknown for you
so i just rub it on ?
i 'm going to the opera
you should join me UNknown
i don 't think so
sure you won 't come ?
no i have to go home
they 'r e probably sold out anyway
why is la UNknown postponed ?
they don 't have a mimi
they don 't have a mimi ? !
what about my tickets then ?
i bought tickets for nine shows
i have to close up jan
they can 't just cancel
what else could they do ?
they shouldn 't announce it without a mimi
change your tickets and wait for opening night
because a sheep is missing from the manger scene jan
the sheep hasn 't left the house
i chose to look in the receiver
just a housewife without a big position at the ferry empire
do not call me that !
sometimes it just won 't fit
why don 't i make us a snack and we UNknown l enjoy the evening ?
UNknown lorraine coming up !
suddenly he slams the brakes
UNknown of UNknown UNknown ran into the street
i don 't buy it
no one is that jinxed
then we will just have to find the guy on the UNknown
does bente hit you ?
does bente hit you ?
does she hit you ?
of course we hit rough sea at times
it 's a vast emotional sea but that 's marriage foryou
i wouldn 't interfere but this affects your work
it can 't go on like this
how often does she beat you ?
when she 's drunk or ?
and that was my fault entirely
sometimes the best help is to leave people UNknown get them some help
now you 'r e UNknown your boundaries eric
i don 't think you 'r e in your right
she doesn 't hit me
seek help or i UNknown l let you go
and i will let you go
what kind of help ?
my wife and i wrestle a bit
UNknown 't it be UNknown just ?
tell us why you are here and what you do
i also beat up a woman and i want to make a real effort this time
i 'm a mechanic too
i also beat up a UNknown wife
i manage a UNknown restaurant on a ferry
next step is to tell the group about UNknown and why you are here
UNknown you care to start alf ?
i was with tina for two years
and i started to poke her a bit after a couple of days
this broad i beat up i met in a bar
but i UNknown e beat up other girls too
bente and i met in junior high and started going steady
i was her senior by two years
it 's a long time ago
UNknown didn 't marry until UNknown when UNknown died
she was so different back then
bente had an amazing voice
when did you start striking your wife ?
now let 's talk about a typical day in your life
i saw a UNknown today
the ferry covers the expenses
of course they have an arrangement
for their mentally ill members sure
the ferry 's big expense account that us ordinary people pay for
and you feel you have the time for that ?
cause i could really use some help around the house
keeping house is no small matter
my UNknown has gotten worse
they 'r e not boiled thoroughly
the fork should let go jan
let 's sum things up
it sounds like you feel inferior to bente
she works all the time while you stay at home sewing curtains
i don 't get it
when she gets home she 's not the bente you fell for she 's a tired bente
a bente who is sick and tired of you lying around on the couch
an annoyed bente who had a rough day on the ferry
bente doesn 't love you anymore
she loved the jan you used to be
the jan she dreamt of singing in la UNknown with
the jan with the meaningful job
but jan does have a job !
rudy we 'r e on the verge of a breakthrough
the jan and the bente who once vowed to stay UNknown are no more
there is only the jan and bente who ruin each other 's lives when they come home
is bente working on the ferry now ?
one more word and you 'r e gone !
i 'm at home all day and i hate that i can 't be the jan that once was that jan that bente fell in love with
and that 's why i hit her
that 's why you hit her
i know that i should get a job get out of the house and seek help
you have a job !
but if i were bente
what should i do ?
bente i UNknown e been thinking about the two of us
i was thinking about us
and the janitor at the UNknown du UNknown who called us orpheus and eurydice ?
it 's so long ago
it 's been so long since we did something together
don 't you think ?
and the black rose you gave me for my birthday with a little note that said
you had been all over town to find a black rose because black is my favorite color
technically black is not a color
it 's the color of imagination
you know that i UNknown e always loved you but
it 's an old chair that 's all
it because i 'm too fat ?
no you 'r e not fat
you 'r e not too fat or too skinny
you 'r e just right
we 'r e very busy
it won 't happen again
UNknown didn 't do it
not anymore there isn 't
give it time to take effect
things don 't change overnight
in the old days we could piss in the food and throw people over board
the bridge gives people a choice
you scare off the customers
it would benefit everyone if you left bente
i 'm in group therapy
you told me to seek help
and i 'm getting it
the union won 't like you forcing me to leave my wife
i 'm doing this for your sake !
if i stuck to the rules i 'd have fired you long ago
i really want to stay on eric
please give me more time to make progress in the group
i 'm just saying that whenever i meet a broad
i get more and more paranoid the more she says she loves me
and then i just lose it
don 't you see it 's UNknown get a hooker ?
UNknown doesn 't care if you say i love you or i UNknown l punch you
of course it 's extra to beat her up
that 's how it is
shut the fuck up rudy !
you know what i mean right ?
yes i think i do
lovers sing for the same reason children whistle in the dark
all UNknown are female that 's why we have UNknown
one more word and we stop !
you admit that you have commitment issues because you know you have a dark side
i don 't have a dark side
if UNknown is fucking a guy
it 's natural for you to want to beat the shit out UNknown
how can that be normal ?
wake the fuck up UNknown !
for argument 's sake let 's say the impulse is there
but to act on it is wrong
put distance between the heart and the hand
egyptians thought with their hearts
why don 't you shut the fuck up ? !
yeah that UNknown l make him pay up
tell him it 's with interest
it 's a dog 's life
so what 's with you ?
go home and get the wife to blow you
there 's time for a beer too
but you wanted a coke
rudy is at the UNknown machine
what 's with you ?
it 's just a figure of speech
is he the guy that fired you anna ?
what 's wrong with you ?
her mom is sick damn it !
this doesn 't involve you
this guy wants to kick jan 's ass
no no it 's just
that 's gonna hurt tomorrow
yup i nailed him good
what 's this eight hour cream doing in the bathroom huh ?
did you bring someone here ?
did you bring a woman into our house ?
bente when would i do that ?
you don 't use eight hour cream
at least show me some respect and admit it
i promise to forgive you
tell it like it is sweetie
l UNknown l be nice about it alright ?
just get it out there and we can move on
you 'r e leaving me
that shrink got you started
i can 't go on like this
i 'm the one who can 't go on like this !
you 'r e never seeing that psycho shrink again !
and we don 't have the time
just thought i 'd ask
if you want her life insurance put her in a car wreck
my uncle sent his wife over a cliff
then why do you want UNknown off ?
you have to give it serious thought
killing someone is a big deal
eight years behind bars if they nail you
she is cheating on me
yes i believe he is
and it 's been going on for years
and who knows for how long
it ends right here jan !
9 10 11 12 13 14 500
go to work we UNknown l show up at 10
then you bury her behind the opera house ?
sure in the forest behind it
UNknown UNknown we went there often
bente and i when we were young
bente always wanted to sing there one day
it 's her big dream
it 's a nice place
how much is the bridge ?
get a one day round trip
are you taking the bridge ?
i don 't want her to suffer
if you can avoid it
he ordered the UNknown UNknown but it 's cold so he won 't pay for it
you wanna call the cops ?
he ordered the UNknown UNknown but the oil isn 't hot in the morning
apologize and give him back his money
i UNknown l take care ofit
what are you doing bente ?
and what are you doing here ? !
this is rudy and alf
the mechanics who came to look at the car
bente you 'r e singing
rudy and alf are really into opera
but you have to look at the car
UNknown you know everything 's going as planned
she opens the door and it wasn 't as easy as we thought
not as easy ? !
it wasn 't supposed to be easy
you can 't break it
she is the spitting image of my mother
it 's the nose and the eyes
it brought out some emotions i haven 't felt in a long time
it 's a big mess in there
i have to talk to UNknown about it
UNknown can 't do it
she had a hard life
and my dad beat her up and left her
see how that stirs things up ?
UNknown should talk it through
talk is for old folks
are you coming in ?
you 'r e not going in
UNknown already UNknown for it
you UNknown e been outside ? !
yes we all went to the supermarket
alf is a member so he gets 4 off
yes i get this check once a year
they call it the dividend
UNknown don 't give a rat 's ass
you think the meat is UNknown out ?
just one more song bente
i don 't think that 's such a good idea
no because there 's no singing in this house
UNknown have an opera rule
we UNknown e always had it
so let 's not break it
if bente wants to sing she UNknown l sing
rudy let 's go into the kitchen
you just sing if you want to
you have a great wife jan
i want you out now
and rudy is not making a UNknown
don 't ever fucking threaten me
and you better lay off hitting bente
you 'r e a sick bastard if you slap her
you lay a finger on her and you die
now i 'm drinking the soup
it 's appropriate to offer your guest UNknown and a re fill on the peanuts
UNknown sang a lot back then
UNknown the head of the opera said
i was one ofhis most promising pupils
we were both accepted into the conservatory
jan had a pretty good voice too
but then we had the fire
i had cooked pasta for us
i had forgotten to turn off the gas
jan came into the kitchen with a lit cigarette
only the manger scene in there survived it
the UNknown in jan 's ears began
and it was all my fault
is it ringing now ?
why did you stop singing just because jan couldn 't ?
because of the opera rule
hold it right there bente
what with the opera rule ?
jan was devastated by his loss
and it was kind of implied that if jan couldn 't sing none of us should
that 's not entirely true bente
you dragged me down with you
at least i moved on
i got a job to put food on the table and pay the rent
bente on the other hand chose to get a depression
she just quit the academy
because you told me to !
you said we were through if i sang
that it was too painful
so i chose to stay with you i chose not to pursue my calling
i thought you were my calling
i thought our love came first
but i guess i was wrong
cause the minute i left the academy
jan rose in the ranks of the ferry empire
suddenly there was no time for me
no loving remark no loving look
only criticism criticism criticism and the ferry
you took opera away from me and gave me nothing in return
i could have been somebody jan but you didn 't care as long as you had your ferry
your oh so precious ferry !
you see what i 'm up against every day ?
and with this cold hearted prick
i 'm so disappointed !
i think you should leave the table
don 't you get it ? !
where should i go ?
and leave the UNknown pal
i really look forward to seeing you too
all my clothes needs ironing
what 's going on bente ?
i have an audition in four hours
what about the opera rule then ?
he 's doing it again
rules are made to be broken
alf said a clever thing
that you should never quit your dream
UNknown UNknown would have told you that lovers shouldn 't just whistle in the dark but really sing through
where 's my damn makeup ? !
l UNknown l just clean up and we UNknown l be off
do you have a map ?
why are you acting so weird ?
it 's bente she is
it 's totally out of whack at home
i never got you man
you could never control bente
why the fuck don 't you punch UNknown out ?
you 'r e not supposed to hit women
just smack her one and she UNknown l fucking behave
i don 't think so
you better fucking believe it
UNknown knocks me around too
he hits you ? !
hell yeah he teaches driver 's ed
UNknown 'r e country folks
and you take it ?
how did it go at the opera house ?
let 's see how did it go
UNknown said i had to get used to being on stage but the part is mine
god looked down and said
others will have to bow
it 's bente 's turn now
alf came up with that in the car
where are alf and rudy ?
bente i will only say this once
you get one chance to obey me UNknown will be consequences
get off the suck up bus !
because we have rules in this house that we follow
otherwise there UNknown l be consequences
sit down and eat !
obey me right now bente !
pick up the phone and call the opera house and say
hello hello may i speak to UNknown ?
i wasn 't quite myself
of course i can 't be a part of your show
right this minute bente !
do i make myself clear ?
do i make myself clear i asked !
or should my fists speak UNknown ?
you 'r e not stopping me
do you realize how happy this makes me ?
what a big challenge this is ?
it 's sailing at full throttle
and i want to be on board jan
you should support me instead
it 's the part of a lifetime
UNknown the part is not that big
you 'r e doing it again !
you 'r e driving me insane !
i don 't have time foryour deaf ears and
do you understand or are you too deaf to hear anything ?
you 'r e hitting me now ?
are you hitting me too ?
you should lay off on the pastry
just cause it 's free you shouldn 't overdo it
you shouldn 't abuse company hospitality
one UNknown forthe two gentlemen
it 's a beautiful language
it was made for singing
jan god damn it !
why the fuck did you tell karin she was fat ?
that 's a right out lie
i UNknown on her need for pastry but i UNknown her figure
you want some advice ?
eric it 's very inconvenient
this has nothing to do with karin
yes i had a severe migraine
that 's why the brace is necessary
they said you didn 't sign up
at first you told me this job was temporary
i thought i did but my ears never got better
you 'r e the primary reason people take the bridge
i didn 't know i was in the wrong group
and i never said karin was fat
i won 't be back till late
l UNknown l be sitting here all night
i will be really really late
where are you going ?
to a huge party on the ferry
wlth a live band dinner drinks
try to hold her a bit closer
i can 't concentrate with that guy sitting there
can i please talk to you bente ?
did you hurt yourself doll ?
no no i 'm fine
is anything wrong jan ?
no no just need a word
no i don 't think i will
so you can 't focus !
how will he focus when the theater is packed ?
from now on the doors must stay locked
it 's hard enough for bente as it is
can 't you see how embarrassing this is ?
you don 't belong here
is it this bad every day ?
it doesn 't sound very good
are you still up ?
why are you this late ?
UNknown won 't let up
he is wearing me out
l UNknown l lose my voice before opening night
and you showing up doesn 't help
UNknown only hired them because i asked him to
alf took a swing at a singer today
alf this and alf that
i 'm sick of hearing about alf
if it hadn 't been for me you wouldn 't know alf and rudy
you 'd like to know huh ?
and you know why ?
i 'm too tired to argue
and i 'm going to a release party for a new album
in the middle of the night ?
that 's how it 's done now
but of course you wouldn 't know
it was evident today when i heard your voice
i UNknown e been thinking
i think it might be a good idea UNknown
i don 't think we 'r e good for each other
i have absolutely UNknown for this
no let 's do it now
i think we should take a break from each other
you think so too ?
UNknown might not be as good for each other as you might think
i feel like my wings are clipped
honestly i think we should make a clean break now
no i can 't deal with your crying and clinging to me
that 's why i wanted to wait till tomorrow
because i 'm moving out tomorrow to my new house
you have a new house ?
as security a back up
and there 's this girl from the ferry that you UNknown l have to meet one day
seeing as we 'r e laying our cards on the table
there are other fish in the sea bente
tall as well as short
did you want something ?
they don 't allow romantic ties between employees but my dismissal allows for new options
i know i UNknown e seemed cold and distant due to my position
but don 't worry i still felt this
so i think we should stop beating around the bush because we both know what 's going on
and i UNknown l be happy to make the first move by taking you out to dinner with the best of everything
you have always been a little crazy but it seems to be worse
i 'd like a thousand of them
that 's the least you can do
ask for danish or swedish currency
in this case it 's danish
take the money put it in the register and hand them the change
when that 's done press the button and let them through
oh you 'r e from sweden
what are you doing here ?
i could ask you the same thing
opening night is in two days
do you work here ?
don 't hold up traffic
UNknown need a round trip
you have a coffee machine radio and everything in there
one thousand six hundred and eighty five
that was then this is now alf
your van is over 18 feet
that makes it a heavy vehicle
it 's not 18 feet
then we UNknown l turn around !
she can 't take the pressure
you 'r e wearing her out
her voice is out of this world
come on it 's not that great
then i could be in it too
imagine you being an opera star
how much do you weigh ?
i should think i did before my ears went bad
i saw the accident as a gift
you didn 't have to waste more time pursuing a dream that would never come true
you have been living in a dream world
it 's time to move on
or let at least bente move on
the things you dream of in life jan don 't always match your abilities
i just wanted to say hi
i really don 't have time for that
i want you to have this
i 'd really like you to come
i have never sung in front of an audience without you there
i 'm in charge of a bridge
i can 't just run off
why are you walking around out here ?
rudy and alf are going through there
you 'r e too expensive
then have a nice evening
you 'r e too late
they 'r e almost finished
you know the rules jan
once they start i can 't let you in
can 't you break the rules just this once ?
yes you can break the rules
i have to see bente
she has waited her whole life to sing
you have to let me in just this once

it 's as if they have no idea what kind of law it is
as if it 's the emblem of a riding club
a UNknown UNknown 9 ?
no no we don 't have that
we UNknown l do this to avoid that
that 's what they have done since thousands of years
it 's what they do
but this storm is different
this is not the romans
this storm is the ss
if god wants to honor you
then he UNknown l send you world wide
UNknown UNknown ha ha ha !
who is that man ?
that 's oskar schindler !
UNknown UNknown ha ha ha !
he sends you away world wide
he sends you away world wide
private property cannot be confiscated
how long are the schools going to be closed ?
you don 't know anything !
they come into our house and tell us we don 't live there any more
i only know what they tell me
and what they tell me changes from day to day !
aren 't you supposed to be able to help ?
i mean what if i just took this thing off ?
what are they going to do about it ?
why don 't you stop this silly talk ?
i 'm looking for UNknown stern
where can we talk ?
there 's a company you did the books for on UNknown street
by law i have to tell you sir i 'm a jew
well i 'm a german
i know nothing about UNknown
i was just the accountant
simple engineering though wouldn 't you think ?
change the machines around whatever you do you could make other things couldn 't you ?
once the war ends forget it but for now it 's great
you can make a fortune don 't you think ?
i think most people right now have other UNknown
i 'm sure you UNknown l do just fine once you get the contracts
in fact the worse things get the better you UNknown l do
oh well i can get the signatures i need
that 's the easy part
finding the money to buy the company that 's hard
you don 't have any money ?
not that kind of money
you must have contacts in the jewish business community working here
jews can no longer own businesses
that 's why this one 's in UNknown
but they wouldn 't own it
i 'd pay them back in product pots and pans
something they can feel in their hands
they can trade it on the black market do whatever they want
if you want you could run the company for me
they 'd put up all the money i 'd do all the work
what if you don 't mind my asking would you do ?
i 'd make sure it 's known the company 's in business
i 'd see that it had a certain UNknown
that 's what i 'm good at
not the work not the work
i 'm sure i don 't know anybody who UNknown l be interested in this
well they should be UNknown stern
i UNknown e got a client who UNknown l sell marks for UNknown at 2 45 to 1
it 's a nice coat
she UNknown l trade it for ration coupons
you have a UNknown of UNknown ?
what am i going to do with a UNknown of UNknown ?
9 by 12 9 by 14
you don 't recognize this ?
you asked for shoe polish
this is glass it 's not what i asked for
what 's the difference ?
what 's the difference ?
what 's the difference ?
my client sold it to his client who sold it to the german army
only by the time it got there because of the freezing cold it broke
this is not my problem
this is not his problem
this is not your problem ?
this is not my problem
the german army wants to find out where it came from
i am going to make sure they find out
now it 's your problem
do you know where i can find a nice shirt like that ?
it 's illegal to buy or sell anything on the street
we don 't do that
we 'r e here to pray
do you have any idea how much a shirt like this costs ?
i 'm going to need some other things too as things come up
this won 't be a problem
fill in the forms !
go on go on !
don 't push each other !
this is obviously the right place
how are you doing ?
it could not be better
uh the UNknown assembly has its own police now
i 'm a policeman now could you believe it ?
it 's hard to believe
oh no it 's not hard to believe
it 's a good racket UNknown
look maybe i could put in a good word for you with my superiors
come on they 'r e not as bad as everyone says
well they 'r e worse than everyone says but it 's a lot of money
a lot of money !
you look funny in that hat goldberg
you look like a clown you know ?
he 's a very important man
just give him two minutes of your time
since when did time cost money ?
for each thousand you invest i will repay you with
two hundred 200 kilos of UNknown a month to begin in july and to continue for one year
after which time we 'r e even
it 's not good enough !
look where you 'r e living
look where you UNknown e been put
a couple of months ago you 'd be right not anymore
no it is not !
that 's why we are here
trade goods that 's the only currency that UNknown l be worth anything in the ghetto
things have changed my friend
did i call this meeting ?
you told mr stern you wanted to speak to me
i UNknown e made you a fair offer
fair would be a percentage in the company
how do we know that you will do what you say ?
because i said i would
you want a contract ?
to be UNknown by what court ?
i said what i UNknown l do
five six seven eight nine
the standard ss rate for jewish skilled UNknown is seven marks a day five for UNknown and women
this is what you pay the reich economic office
the jews themselves receive nothing
generally they get a little more
what was that about the ss ?
the jewish worker 's salary you pay it directly to the ss not to the worker
it 's less than what i would pay a pole
that 's the point i 'm trying to make
why should i hire poles ?
an UNknown factory over at UNknown street
it 's owned by a german
but it 's outside the ghetto so you can barter for extra goods for eggs i don 't know what you need with the polish workers
you can 't get it here
also he 's asking for ten healthy women for the
bring your sister okay ?
you need to convince them you have a trade something valuable to the war effort
what if you don 't ?
your name goes on a list
your name is on the list they put you on trucks
no no no that 's not true
i 'd find a good hiding place if i were you
i 'm not going to hide like some animal
there are places to hide
i 'm a graduate of the university of UNknown
i used to work at the UNknown station in UNknown
i 'm gonna get the necessary papers because this card is no good any more
you can stay in this line all day you UNknown l still get one of these
you UNknown l have to leave the line now then you UNknown l get a blue card a UNknown to say that you are an essential worker
enjoying the weather UNknown ?
need some shoe polish ?
in metal container maybe !
i think you misunderstand the meaning of the word
what do you mean not essential ?
i teach history and literature
since when it 's not essential ?
it was not right ?
he 's 53 years old
you left it in your drawer
how many times have i told you ?
your work certificate you keep in your pocket at all times
and you leave everything in your drawer
how many times i UNknown e told you ?
i 'm a metal UNknown !
we obtain the soup pot
UNknown mrs UNknown stay together
but don 't touch both the UNknown at the same time
you UNknown l get electrocuted
but moses is a skilled UNknown
he can make tin pots
he can make whatever mr schindler asks
and whatever he asks you allow me just to represent you and speak for you
don 't say a word !
how is your typing ?
i don 't know how
they 'r e all so qualified
big smile big smile !
if you would look after my guest
um boxed UNknown are good
coffee p t um UNknown sausage cheeses UNknown caviar and of course who could live without german cigarettes ?
get me as many as you can find
and some more fresh fruit
the real UNknown oranges UNknown pineapples
and dark UNknown chocolate not in the shape of UNknown the chunk chocolate
big as my hand you sample at wine UNknown
we 'r e going to need lots of cognac
yeah i need 700 gross from here for next thursday
nine hundred no make it ten for wednesday
all this stuff here goes to UNknown 's factory on tuesday of next week
my father was fond of saying you need three things in life
a good doctor a forgiving priest
the first two i UNknown e never had much use for
just pretend for christ 's sake !
i 'm trying to thank you
i 'm saying i couldn 't have done this without you
the usual thing would be to acknowledge my gratitude
it would also by the way be the courteous thing
i don 't have to like her just because you do
it doesn 't work that way
you UNknown e done well here
be careful of the step miss
how could it be a charade ?
the clothes the car the apartment
my father at the height of his success had 50
i UNknown e got 350
350 workers on the factory floor with one purpose
to make pots and pans ?
does anyone ask about me ?
they won 't soon forget the name schindler here i can tell you that
oskar schindler they UNknown l say
he did something no one else did
he came here with nothing a suitcase
and built a bankrupt company into a major UNknown
and left with a steamer trunk
two steamer trunks full of money
all the riches of the world
it 's comforting to see that nothing 's changed
you 'r e wrong UNknown
there 's no way i could have known this before but there was always something missing
in every business i tried i can see now it wasn 't me that failed
even if i 'd known what it was there 's nothing i could have done about it because you can 't create this thing
it 's a beautiful city
i asked you if i should stay
it 's up to you
i could try to read this or i could eat my lunch while it 's still hot
any reason to think next month will be worse ?
there is a UNknown outside who 'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job
it UNknown l just take a minute
i want to thank you sir for giving me the opportunity to work
i 'm sure you 'r e doing a great job
the ss beat me up
they would have killed me but i am essential to the war effort thanks to you
i work hard for you
i 'm sure you do
i UNknown l continue to work hard for you
you are a good man
i 'm sorry herr UNknown but you 'r e running very late
this is for the major sir
and this is for his niece greta
did you notice that man had one arm ?
we UNknown l be late for work
you shouldn 't think of them as yours oskar
you need to understand that some of the officers here don 't give a damn about production
i am an essential worker
i work for oskar schindler
essential worker for oskar schindler
a one armed jew ?
UNknown look at the snow
look at the snow !
i expect to be UNknown
file a UNknown with the economic office
would it do any good ?
a one armed UNknown oskar ?
i don 't believe it
stern is that you ?
he 's on the list
well let 's find him
you can 't have him
he 's on the list
if he were an essential worker he would not be on the list
i 'm talking to a clerk
what is your name ?
sir the list is correct
i didn 't ask you about the list
squad leader this gentleman thinks a mistake 's been made
my plant manager is somewhere on this train
the train is about to leave

gentlemen thank you very much
makes no difference to us you understand

i somehow left my work card at home
i 'm sorry it was stupid !
what if i got here five minutes later ?
then where would i be ?
you laugh about it ?
you are living behind walls
the walls i can deal with
it 's the restrictions to my life i 'm tired of
those walls keep them out
that 's all i care about
there 's a kind of i don 't know ancestral squalor to it all
you are a slave to these people
no one UNknown us any more
oh yes you 'r e smart !
you 'r e a real genius
today today i actually found time to organize a thought
i can 't remember the last time i did that
when 's the last time we did this ?
when 's the last time we stood around and talked ?
no one ordered me onto a truck today
no one took my business away from me
you don 't really have a business to take
there 's nowhere down from here
the ghetto is liberty !
this street UNknown the ghetto just about in half
civil employees industrial workers and so on
surplus labour the elderly and UNknown mostly
which is where you UNknown l want to start huh ?

and we have a dentist shoemaker practical physicians
one of you is uh a very lucky girl

yeah on second thought i don 't really want someone else 's maid
all those annoying habits i have to undo
i don 't want to give you my cold
she says the foundation was poured wrong
she 's got to take it down
i told her it 's the barracks not the fucking hotel UNknown
the entire foundation has to be torn down and UNknown

do you know the saying an hour of life is still life ?
you are not a boy any more
oh please let 's go
let 's go please !
mark it mark it !
can we still manage today ?
we can 't manage it
but it 's private industry like yours that stands to benefit most by moving inside the wire of commandant amon UNknown 's camp
julian how are you ?
i miss anything good ?
i was explaining to herr UNknown and herr UNknown some of the benefits of moving their factories into UNknown
since your labour is UNknown on site it 's available to you at all times
you can work them all night if you want
your factory policies whatever they UNknown e been in the past they UNknown l continue to be
they UNknown l be respected
i have to know where do you get a suit like that ?
i 'd say i 'd get you one but the man who made it is probably dead
they 'r e not gone
they 'r e mine !
every day that goes by i 'm losing money
every worker that is shot costs me money
i have to find somebody else
i have to trade them !
we are going to be making so much money that none of this is going to matter
that you know the meaning of the word gratitude
that it 's not some vague thing with you like it is with others
you want to stay where you are
you UNknown e got things going on the side
you don 't want anybody telling you what to do
i can understand all that you know ?
what you want is your own sub camp
do you have any idea what is involved ?
you UNknown e got to build the fucking thing
i 'm telling you you want to shoot somebody
you UNknown e been through it
you could make things easier for me
goldberg and UNknown make sure i see my cut from the uh factory owners in this camp leaving you to take care of my main account the schindler account
i gave it to him
makes them think we have lice
helps make them keep their distance
do you have lice ?
do you have your notebook ?
the calendar on my desk has the birthdays of our ss friends wives and children
don 't forget to send something
record pay UNknown to the main administration and economics office the UNknown
list lower drawer of my desk which you handle as cash contributions to legitimate charities sent to each official 's office
dealings with our black market contacts listed as UNknown
in the legitimate ledger are more complicated
what do you mean you can 't forget it !
it gives me a headache !
i couldn 't get you out of here
i UNknown l be all right
i UNknown l look in on you see how you 'r e doing
here put these in your pocket
mr director don 't let things fall apart
what are you making ?
yeah i UNknown e got some workers coming in tomorrow
where are they from again ?
i UNknown e got to make room
keep going you 'r e doing well
says he 's doing well
oh that 's very good
but i 'm a bit confused and perhaps you can help me
what i don 't understand is that you UNknown e been working since i think what about 6 00 this morning ?
may i try that sir ?
you wouldn 't hear a click if it was the angle lever
maybe the pin shaft is greasy
i beg to report that my heap of hinges was so UNknown because the machines were being UNknown this morning
i was put on to UNknown coal
don 't touch the leather it 's just been oiled
oh thank you very much mr director
so the man can turn out a UNknown in less than a minute
why the long story ?
you 'r e welcome !
nobody knows who stole the chicken ?
tell him about the chicken
thank you again mr director !
you 'r e welcome again
it 's an honour to work for such a great company
it 's great to have you !
i promise to learn everything there 's to know about UNknown production
miss elsa krause is here
i only need five minutes
he won 't see you
so what can i do for you ?
they say that no one dies here
they say your factory is a haven
they say you are good
my name is regina UNknown not elsa krause
i UNknown e been living in UNknown on false papers since the ghetto massacre
my parents are in UNknown
their names are UNknown and UNknown UNknown
they are killing older people now in UNknown
they bury them up in the forest
look i don 't have any money
i i borrowed these clothes
please please bring them here
i don 't do that
you UNknown e been misled
whether or not a worker has certain skills
my father is an UNknown not a UNknown
you will not UNknown me !
cry and i will have you arrested
it 's a fact of life
what am i supposed to do about it ?
is that what you think ?
send them over to schindler
his place is a haven didn 't you know ?
it 's not a factory
it 's not an enterprise of any kind
it 's a haven for UNknown and orphans and people with no skills whatsoever !
you think i don 't know what you 'r e doing ?
you 'r e so quiet all the time
i know i know !
are you losing money ?
that 's not the point !
it 's dangerous to me !
UNknown is under enormous pressure
you have to think of it in his situation
he 's got this whole place to run
he 's responsible for everything here all these people
he 's got a lot of things to worry about
and he 's got the war which brings out the worst in people
never the good always the bad
but in normal circumstances he wouldn 't be like this
he 'd be all right
there 'd just be the good aspects of him which
he 's a wonderful crook
he can 't enjoy it
UNknown told me the other day somebody escaped from a work detail outside the wire
UNknown lined up everybody from the missing man 's barracks
he shot the man to the left of UNknown the man to the right of him
he walked down the line shooting every other man with a pistol
UNknown and UNknown UNknown !
i 'm sure this will be better than those rags UNknown
mr director i was just helping UNknown to find something to clean the stains from the commander 's bathtub
you don 't have to report to me helen
you know who i am ?
i i have heard and you have been here before
here why don 't you keep this someplace ?
i get extra food here
well if you don 't want to eat it trade it
or give it to UNknown
why not build yourself up ?
my first day here he beat me because i threw out the bones from dinner
he came down to the basement at midnight and he he asked me where they were
for his dogs you understand ?
i said to him i i don 't know how i say this
i never could say it now i said to him why are you beating me ?
he said the reason i beat you now is because you ask why i beat you
i know your sufferings helen
one day he will shoot me
a woman carrying a bundle
just just a woman on her way somewhere you know
she was no fatter or thinner or slower or faster than anyone else and i couldn 't guess what had she done
the more you see of the commander the more you see there is no set rules that you can live by
you can 't say to yourself if i follow these rules i will be safe
he won 't shoot you because he enjoys you too much
he enjoys you so much he won 't even let you wear the star
he doesn 't want anyone else to know it 's a jew he 's enjoying
he shot the woman from the steps because she meant nothing to him
she was one of a series neither offending or pleasing him
it 's not that kind of a kiss
why do you drink that motor oil ?
i send you good stuff all the time
your liver 's going to explode like a hand grenade
you know i look at you i watch you !
you 'r e never drunk
oh that 's that 's real control
is that why they fear us ?
we have the fucking power to kill that 's why they fear us
they fear us because we have the power to kill UNknown
a man commits a crime he should know better
we have him killed and we feel pretty good about it
or we kill him ourselves and we feel even better
that 's not power though
it 's different than power
power is when we have every justification to kill and we don 't
you think that 's power ?
that 's what the UNknown had
a man stole something he 's brought in before the emperor he throws himself down on the ground he begs for mercy
he knows he 's going to die
and the emperor pardons him
i think you are drunk
what do they want ?
i don 't know but they 'r e in my office right now UNknown our books
as my accountant tell me should i be alarmed that the UNknown are UNknown my books ?
or have you done your job properly ?
you needn 't be alarmed
i needn 't be alarmed !
do you know how much this saddle is worth ?
do you know how much it costs ?
she was smoking on the job
tell her not to do it again
i have to report sir i UNknown e been unable to remove the stains from your bathtub
go ahead go on leave
although i am not a rabbi in these circumstances i pray to the almighty that he will forgive me if i UNknown the blessings
so this is where you come to hide from me
i came to tell you that you um you really are a wonderful cook and a well trained servant
if you need a reference after the war i 'd be i 'd be happy to give you one
it must get lonely down here when you 'r e listening to everyone upstairs having such a good time
but what 's the right answer ?
that 's what you 'r e thinking
what does he want to hear ?
the truth helen is always the right answer
yes you 'r e right
i would like so much to reach out and touch you in your loneliness
wh what would that be like i wonder ?
i mean what would be wrong with that ?
i realize that you 'r e not a a person in the the strictest sense of the word but
no maybe you 'r e right about that too you know maybe what 's what 's wrong isn 't it 's not us !
it 's no it 's this !
i mean when they compare you to to uh vermin and to UNknown and to lice i just uh
no no you you make a good point
you make a very good point
is this the face of a rat ?
are these the eyes of a rat ?
hath not a jew eyes ?
i feel for you helen
no i don 't think so
you 'r e a jewish bitch !
on behalf of the of the workers sir
i i wish for you a happy birthday
thank you very much for the lovely cake
tell them thank you from me
the trains arrived and the people were driven out with clubs
they were lined up in front of two big warehouses
one was marked cloak room and the other valuables
and there they were made to undress
a jewish boy handed them pieces of string to tie their shoes together
they told them it was needed to make something special for u boat crews
and then they were herded down a big corridor to UNknown with stars of david on the doors and signs that said bath and UNknown room
they told them to breathe all the time because it 's good for UNknown
and then they gassed them
so that they would agree to go in i think
come on UNknown stop it
your bedtime stories are scaring everyone
you know it 's ridiculous
i don 't believe it either
i didn 't say i believed it
i said i heard it
from somebody who heard it from someone who was there
it doesn 't make any sense
we 'r e their UNknown
what sense does it make to kill your own UNknown ?
to go to all this trouble of UNknown a UNknown only to
no it can 't be true
we are very very important for them
we have to go to the roll call area !
the list makers are here is to come to the roll call area
you could afford to lose some weight amon
what 's going on ?
i UNknown e got another shipment coming in of
we UNknown e got to separate the sick from the healthy to make room
whose bright idea was it to get rid of him ?
look separate the sick from the healthy
those who can work and those who can 't
those not selected for transport put your clothes back on
go back to the barracks
back to the barracks !
go back to your barracks !
i didn 't see him !
i 'm telling you they 'r e hiding
she knows a good place
find your own hiding place
there 's no room for you here
why didn 't you call me ?
i tried to call you
they 'r e running a little late
it 's taking longer than i thought
the loading of the transport wagons is finished
go bring the fire hoses
that 's it more more !
that 's it that 's it
this is really cruel oskar
you are giving them hope
you shouldn 't do that
come on try and reach the far end
i UNknown e got some 200 UNknown hoses back in UNknown
i have 20 metres at home in my garden
don 't forget the roof !
i 'm not saying you UNknown l regret it but you might
you should be aware of that
we will have to risk regret
it 's a nice day
i UNknown l go for a drive with you
i violated the race and UNknown act
though i doubt anyone can point out the actual provision to me
i kissed a jewish girl
he likes good looking women
he sees a beautiful woman he doesn 't think
i mean he has so many women
i mean he is married yeah but he 's
he shouldn 't have done it
but you didn 't see this girl
this girl was woof she was very good looking
they cast a spell on you you know the jews
when you work closely with them like i do you see this
it 's like a virus
some of my men are infected with this virus
they should be pitied not punished
this is as real as UNknown
i see this all the time
it 's a matter of money ?
you 'r e offering me a bribe ?
we give you jewish girls at five marks a day oskar
you should kiss us not them
god forbid you ever get a real taste for jewish skirt
there 's no future in it
they don 't have a future
that 's not just good old fashioned jew hating talk
what 's going on here ?
you can do it with your hands quick !
as if i don 't have enough to do they come up with this ?
i have to find every rag buried up here and burn it
the party 's over oskar
as soon as i can arrange the UNknown
that ought to be fun
i UNknown e been talking to UNknown
these are the evacuation orders
i 'm to help organize the UNknown put myself on the last train
that 's not what i was going to say
i made UNknown promise me he UNknown l put in a good word for you
nothing bad is going to happen to you there
you UNknown l receive special treatment
the UNknown coming in from berlin mention
special treatment more and more often
i 'd like to think that 's not what you mean
should we invent a whole new language ?
you 'r e staying i take it
what on earth for ?
you have a business to run
of course you UNknown l have to hire new workers
they cost a little more but
what are you going to do ?
no i 'm going home
i UNknown e done what i came here for
i UNknown e got more money than any man can spend in a lifetime
some day this is all going to end you know
i was going to say we UNknown l have a drink then
i think i better have it now
i mean you want these people ?
my people i want my people
who are you moses ?
come on what is this ?
where 's the money in this ?
where 's the scam ?
it 's good business in your opinion
look you UNknown e got to move them the equipment everything to czechoslovakia
pay for all that and build another camp
doesn 't make any sense
look amon it 's good for me
you 'r e not telling me something
i 'm familiar with them
i don 't have to train them
you 'r e not telling me something
it 's good for you
i UNknown l compensate you
it 's good for the army
everyone is making artillery shells
tank shells they need that
everyone 's happy except me
you 'r e probably UNknown me somehow
if i 'm making a hundred you UNknown e got to be making three
and if you admit to making three then it 's four actually
you did but you didn 't
yeah all right don 't tell me
i UNknown l go along with it
it 's just irritating i can 't work it out
look all you have to do is tell me what it 's worth to you
what 's a person worth to you ?
what 's one worth to you ?
you can do the same thing i 'm doing
you might even make money at it
come on julius i know about the extra food and clothes you give them
paid for out of your own pocket
we could UNknown them in something like safety in UNknown
how many cigarettes have you smoked tonight ?
for every one you smoke i smoke half
i UNknown e done all i can
i will not accept that
no oskar i can 't do any more
UNknown say about this ?
you just told him how many people you needed and
you 'r e not buying them ?
you 'r e buying them ?
you 'r e paying him for each of these names ?
if you were still working for me i 'd expect you to talk me out of it
it 's costing me a fortune
the list is an absolute good
all around its UNknown lies the gulf
oskar there 's a clerical error here at the bottom of the last page
no there 's one more name i want to put there
i UNknown l never find a maid as well trained as her at UNknown
if i win the girl goes on my list
i can 't wager helen in a card game
she 's just going to auschwitz number two anyway
what difference does it make ?
she 's not going to auschwitz
i 'd never do that to her
no i want her to come back to vienna with me
i want her to come to work for me there
i want to grow old with her
amon you can 't take her to vienna with you
no of course i can 't
that 's what i 'd like to do
what i can do if i 'm any sort of a man is the next most merciful thing
i shall take her into the woods and shoot her UNknown in the back of the head
what was it you said for a natural 21 ?
we are the family UNknown
UNknown jonas UNknown and UNknown
you know how we make ice into water ?
you UNknown l be pleased with the level of efficiency i get from these workers
UNknown under my command was the envy of every other commandant in the labour camp system
excuse me ! they would have rather been somewhere else
the train with the women has already left UNknown and will be arriving here very shortly
i know you UNknown e had a long journey
but it 's only a short walk further to the factory where hot soup and bread is waiting for you
beans are the best part
i don 't like beans
beans and meat and potatoes and bread
that 's not the way you make UNknown
i don 't like UNknown
what do you like ?
one day on the fire
position yourselves in front of the wagons !
you UNknown e got to stay together
where are the list makers ?
mama where are we ?
17 18 20 they 'r e in auschwitz
the train was never UNknown here
eyes on the necks !
they say to fall against the fence is a kindness
don 't kill yourself against the fence clara
if you do you UNknown l never know what happened to you
how old are you mother ?
a mistake has been made
we are not supposed to be here
we work for oskar schindler
who is oskar schindler ?
how old are you mother ?
you are not the only industrialist who needs labour mr schindler
i remember earlier this year UNknown color ordered a UNknown of UNknown for its chemical factory
the train came in through the UNknown and the officer in charge of the selection went immediately to work and sent 2 000 of them straight away to special treatment
it is not my task to interfere with the UNknown that take place down here
why do you think i can help you if i can 't help UNknown color ?
allow me to express the reason
i 'm not making any judgement about you
it 's just that i know that in the coming months we 'r e all going to need portable wealth
i could have you arrested
i 'm protected by powerful friends
i do not say i am accepting them
all i say is i 'm not comfortable with them on the table
i have a shipment coming in tomorrow
the train comes we turn it around
you shouldn 't get stuck on names
it creates a lot of paperwork
what are you doing ?
these are my workers !
they should be on my train !
they 'r e skilled munitions workers !
they 'r e essential !
their fingers polish the insides of shell metal UNknown
how else am i to polish the inside of a 45 UNknown shell casing ?
back on the train !
back on the train !
under department w provisions it is unlawful to kill a worker without just cause
under the businesses compensation fund i am entitled to file damage claims for such deaths
if you shoot without thinking you go to prison i get paid
that 's how it works
so there will be no summary executions here
there will be no interference of any kind with production
in hopes of UNknown that guards will no longer be allowed on the factory floor without my authorization
for your cooperation you have my gratitude
come on boys come !
no doorman or UNknown d will ever mistake you again i promise
this is UNknown stern my accountant
you must be mrs schindler
it 's a pleasure to meet you
UNknown has volunteered to work in the clinic
we need to talk when you have a moment
this is my wife stern
i don 't keep any secrets from my spouse
oskar please attend to business
we UNknown e received an angry complaint from the UNknown board
the artillery shells tank shells rocket UNknown !
apparently all of them have failed quality control tests
that 's to be expected !
this isn 't pots and pans
this is a precise business
i UNknown l write them a letter
they 'r e withholding payment
sure so would i so would you
we UNknown l get it right one of these days
there 's a rumour you UNknown e been going around UNknown the machines
they could shut us down send us back to auschwitz
i UNknown l call around find out where we can buy shells
pass them off as ours
i don 't see the difference whether they 'r e made here or somewhere else
you don 't see a difference ?
you UNknown l lose a lot of money
fewer shells will be made
how do you do ?
it is friday isn 't it ?
what 's the matter with you ?
you should be preparing for the sabbath
i UNknown e got some wine
i think it 's time the guards came into the factory
the unconditional surrender of germany has just been announced
at midnight tonight the war is over
tomorrow you UNknown l begin the process of looking for survivors of your families
in most cases you won 't find them
after six long years of murder victims are being UNknown throughout the world
thank your fearless stern and others among you who worried about you and faced death at every moment
i 'm a member of the nazi party
i 'm a munitions manufacturer
i 'm a UNknown of slave labour
at midnight you UNknown l be free and i UNknown l be hunted
i shall remain with you until five minutes after midnight after which time and i hope you UNknown l forgive me i have to flee
i know you have received orders from our commandant which he has received from his superiors to dispose of the population of this camp
now would be the time to do it
here they are they 'r e all here
or you could leave and return to your families as men instead of murderers
in memory of the countless victims among your people i ask us to observe three minutes of silence
thank you mr UNknown !
as soon as peace occurs i want um i want that cloth distributed to the workers
two and a half metres each
also each person is to get a bottle of vodka
they won 't drink it
likewise those UNknown cigarettes we organized
it UNknown l be done
we UNknown e written a letter trying to explain things in case you are captured
every worker has signed it
whoever saves one life saves the world entire
i could have got more out
i could have got more
i could have got more
oskar there are 1 100 people who are alive because of you
if i 'd made more money
i threw away so much money
there will be generations because of what you did
i didn 't do enough
this car UNknown would UNknown e bought this car
why did i keep the car ?
he would have given me two for it at least one
he would have given me one one more
a person stern for this !
i could have gotten one more person and i didn 't
and i i didn 't !
you have been liberated by the soviet army !
have you been in poland ?
i just came from poland
are there any jews left ?
where should we go ?
don 't go east that 's for sure
i wouldn 't go west either if i were you
we could use some food
didn 't think i 'd be this nervous
alright UNknown let 's do this
your friend fernando tells me you can use my services today
and i assume thats the other half of your team ?
and it 's my understanding you 'd like to keep this simple ?
we UNknown e never actually manage to keep anything simple
let 's begin then shall we ?
family and friends we gather here
to celebrate the union between michael UNknown and sara UNknown
sorry to break up the party
what the hell 's going on ?
we UNknown e talked to agent paul kellerman in d c we UNknown e settle this with the feds
we settle this with the feds weeks ago !
we 'r e not here for you
we 'r e here for her
she didn 't do anything
don 't make this UNknown !
edited by johns movie library
they UNknown l not gonna let me see her
why did kellerman send you if you can 't do anything ?
they 'r e trying to break both of you
look she has constitutional right to reasonable UNknown
i UNknown l draw up an order to show cause and get it before the judge immediately
what do you argue in ?
anything that might help her is out of frame
to a jury she 's christina hampton technology consultant
and because she was so good at hiding her true identity we can 't prove otherwise
look you all get UNknown did not set well with law enforcement
if they can make sara pay for it they will
how much time is she looking at ?
am i supposed to be in a different facility ?
i don 't think so
i haven 't been convicted of anything yet
i 'm supposed to be in a jail
UNknown and budget cuts fish
was 's up homey ?
you need some help ?
don 't let them spook you
they just like to intimidate
the other one 's practically empty
but then UNknown here figure it out
i remember your pretty face from the papers
you are not going anywhere fish
this is going to happen
half a dozen guards lost their jobs and UNknown at fox river
another dozen were put on probation after you decided to leave the door open for your boyfriend and his seven convict pals
and we ain 't gonna let anything like that happen again
don 't worry we won 't hit the baby basket
looked like that welcome wagon ran over your face
if you need something you just ask for me
you know all we need is a little cash spread around in places
the government 's exposing my assets
you tellin me you can 't get your hands on the cash ?
unless that 's the least you can do
a little roberto de UNknown
i 'm never gonna get out of this prison alive
i wanna bring my enemy down with me
either way it 's going to require a capital
a capital you no longer have
i 'd assume that that would be use for your defense
it 's good money at the bad joe
they 'r e not gonna let me out of here
last time someone touched her they got a crack UNknown
you 'r e much braver than i gave you credit for
either that or you 'r e amazingly nice
do i look like i wanna talk to you ?
i just say a woman in your position laid up for some protection
join the prison gang ?
i don 't think so
they don 't call her daddy for nothin
and those are her kids
stay the hell away from me
can 't go down to the UNknown without the release form
i 'm having muscle UNknown on my throat
and my jaws UNknown up
you UNknown l get used to it
if i don 't get to the hospital in the next 15 minutes
we have an inmate going into the infirmary
we were able to administer the charcoal ???
you and your baby are gonna be okay
you know the ??? didn 't get into my UNknown all by itself right ?
well then you need to talk to the warden about it
then how about talking to me about your face ?
you want to tell me how that happened ?
i caught an elbow playing basketball
we should discuss your situation
as i 'm sure you UNknown e UNknown this isn 't going to be a run of the mill pregnancy
the day we 'r e induced we UNknown l secure you in an ambulance
we UNknown l take you to st lucia down the road
we UNknown l UNknown off a room
there UNknown l be 3 armed guards in there with me when you give birth
do i get to see my baby ?
you UNknown l have 30 minutes before we take it away
i UNknown e seen this process a dozen times
after the mothers come back here the depression 's almost unbearable
your wife had an incident earlier today
someone tried to poison her
what are you talking about ?
if i had a list of all the people who might come to visit me
your name will be at the bottom somewhere below
jesus christ and UNknown doo
only you would be depraved enough to think that killing an innocent woman and an unborn child will bring you some kind of peace before your execution
this is like the 4th of july and christmas day rolled into one
i am asking you father to father to leave her alone
you can kill me if you want to kill me
i UNknown l trade my life for hers
if you were killed your pain will last a moment
if sara were killed your pain will last the rest of your life
now that 's got to be appealing to whoever who put out this hit
but don 't worry michael
if i remember correctly you have two missing toes that can UNknown to that bag
i don 't think you understand
please just approve the transfer to another facility
if i grant her a transfer everybody 's gonna want one
what about UNknown housing ?
is there something that i should know about the UNknown integrity of shoe ?
i can see where this is going
i know who you are
and i 'm not going to let you turn my prison into the next fox river
all i 'm trying to do is keep my wife alive
you do know she 's pregnant
in case i haven 't made myself clear
sara UNknown is not getting any UNknown treatment
and you UNknown e made yourself perfectly clear
thank you for your time
the general wants sara dead
and the warden 's just gonna let that happen
we gotta lure in her case and needs to get her out right ?
which is not enough time
if she stays in that prison someone 's going to kill her
i guess we don 't have a choice
i UNknown e worked cases under 43 different agents
alexander UNknown is the smartest bravest most honorable man i UNknown e ever had the pleasure of serving with
as one of those 43 agents i can 't help but feel a bit offended
because obviously i am not as honoured as this drive addicted murderer
alex has been clean and sober for four months
and he 's been completely UNknown of all crimes associated with his involvement with the company
that doesn 't include the shooting and the murder of one oscar UNknown
and burying his body under his bird bath that is just an UNknown
let 's move on shall we ?
alright alright i UNknown e
thank you for the invite richard
it 's always a pleasure
this ruling can 't be UNknown
if you 'r e able to sufficiently demonstrate just how committed you are to a life of service
now as you may know sara UNknown was arrested recently and is currently being house at the miami UNknown state penitentiary
we have concerns that michael UNknown may have other plans for her
so this this is why you 'r e invite me in here
well obviously if UNknown were to be able to pull off this plot of another UNknown the public UNknown will be UNknown to the bureau
so having someone to get us a UNknown information that would be worth something to us
agent UNknown is set up in miami
he will be your contact
how badly you want that badge back
give me a reason to give it to you
what 's your plan after we break her out ?
we 'r e on the run again ?
the fed that arrested sara is outside UNknown us out
look if you 'r e worried about getting into trouble again go back to chicago go back to your family
are you kidding me ?
after all the crap we UNknown e been through i 'm just going to leave you here and sara in there ?
you shut up and don 't bring it up again
covering 7 different escape attempts from miami UNknown 's state pen over the last 60 years
so we weigh them all and we learn what not to do
well the prison officials learned a lot
they re UNknown they UNknown
the prison 's UNknown escape proof
i guess so if we can 't go through what if we go down ?
like down into the prison ?
you parachute in we find her are you kidding ?
i 'm serious that 's suicide !
newspapers clippings only going to get us so far
we need some more information about the prison
so let 's do some UNknown work
camera electronic tape measure dry ice
it 's a shopping list
you need to come with me doc
i have a doctor 's appointment for my pregnancy in a few minutes
i don 't know what you want but i promise you i won 't go down and fight it
damn baby i ain 't gonna hurt you
hell i ain 't even gonna touch you
you 'r e the fed from my wedding
yeah you can call me agent UNknown
i could call you a lot of things
what really be your loss is getting your wife killed by doing something stupid
i 'm just saying that if you gonna try and UNknown her sentence
and if she 'd get hurt that UNknown l be on you
funny hearing that from the guy who put her in prison in the first place
no i didn 't put her in prison
it 's just my job to make sure that she stays there
drop in some more dry ice
fence line is 4 feet from the road
they 'r e gonna see the UNknown
i 'm going as fast as i can UNknown
yeah but he 's gone now
i UNknown l meet you back at the loft
well you 'r e just a natural
i bet you are a hell of a surgeon
handing out UNknown to cons were makin you no damn surgeon !
what in the hell is the matter with you ?
you ain 't even ask me if she can come
one day for real !
you UNknown e got to forgive my old lady she 's
you just a little bit easy on eyes you know ?
she 's just the jealous type
it 's hard running a family
it 's important though that uh that you have one
oh you UNknown e got a husband ?
yeah i had a husband too
18 years is a long time to wait
if this ain 't for you that 's cool
take your hands off me
when i 'm good and ready
what 's burrows doing at the fence ?
please don 't make me ask you again sara
nobody here that UNknown l help you but yourself
are you going to answer me ?
you tried to kill me
i want you to pass along an offer to your boy
what he 's paying his people to dust that UNknown chicken bitch pop my woman are good for a cut rate
just what kind of discount are you proposing here ?
i UNknown l tell him
so you have no cash whatsoever
i won 't ask again
oh to what do we owe the honor ?
i UNknown e been thinking
well no need to be uh shy
i UNknown e change my mind
no well maybe daddy change her mind
please may i be a part of your family ?
you see its not that easy
it 's just saying i do
see in order to make a commitment to a family
it 's something you gotta prove
that 's right we all did it
it 's a commitment to the family code
how are you doing man ?
what 's going on ?
sounds a lot like inside information alex
make a deal with the feds ?
they offered me my old job back if i came down here to spy on you
now the fed you 'r e talking about his name is UNknown
so if you really gonna do this you gotta do it right
and i UNknown l help you if you need me
what else do you get ?
sara 's working the motor pool today at 4 o UNknown lock
this hold by two security cameras along the perimeter of the prison
what about secondary entrances ?
if sara can get herself back to motor pool
i think we can find a way inside
with all the different UNknown over the years the fence line is UNknown
but security cameras remain exactly where they UNknown e always been
they UNknown e never accounted for the difference
if sara can get back to that spot we can breach the fence
that 's all we UNknown e got
we UNknown e got no UNknown no phone calls
sure looks like you UNknown e been busy
do you have a warrant agent UNknown ?
no i don 't need one
my testimony will be your brother let me in
once inside saw all this evidence right in plain sight
what judge gonna take your word over mine ?
those pictures were taken from public property
that prison was paid for by the taxpayers
so all you have evidence of is an UNknown citizen standing on a public road taking pictures of a public building
last i checked it 's not a crime
what if i said that i could get you on attempt just for having all these stuff ?
what if i told you that all this was peace offering ?
the warden won 't let me see my wife
so i figured if i found a few lapse in the security pointed them out as a gesture of good faith she might change her mind ?
well thank goodness for that
you guys will let me know if anything comes up right ?
you UNknown l be the first to know
on the outside i was known for getting the job done
i got paid well for it
but i still need things
it 's not what it says on the bathroom walls
as i understand you 'd do favors for those who UNknown
this is bullshit boss !
i 'm a veteran around here
ain 't no reason to toss me !
that brown ain 't mine boss
i do no drugs !
who put that in here ? !
take your hands off me
i know where the hold is
what y 'a ll looking at ?
i do no drugs !
somebody is going down there !
sofia 's making arrangements in central america
just got a decision from the court
they 'r e ordering the warden to allow UNknown UNknown
where are you going ?
if you going to be listening to every word you say you gotta be careful about this
she 's going to blink the morse code ?
who did this to you ?
sara i 'm so sorry
you 'r e in here because of me
you just have to hang in there okay ?
but my protection 's gone
i know sometimes it 's hard for me to express what i want to say
isn 't he cute ?
you were there for me
i was thinking a lot
about the photos and the mock up that you showed me at the loft
and i ran a few tests
lo and behold i UNknown e found a UNknown
right along the fence line over here due to our UNknown
you didn 't know about this did you ?
no no of course not
because you would UNknown e told me or the warden about it if you did right ?
well it 's a good thing i found this when i did in case anyone tries to escape
well if we can 't go through the fence then that leaves under or over
i 'm guessing there 's no telephone wire for her to climb across
then she 's gotta go under
alright lets get some shovels
you can be UNknown UNknown ?
couple of thoughts on that
a we don 't have a plane
b we don 't have a pilot
have you ever worn a parachute ?
don 't worry i think i UNknown e got a plan
you want a favor from me
i mean when you and michael send me back to that prison you did give me a piece of chewing gum
all you gotta do is sound off the fire alarm in here
tomorrow night at 7 30
you 'r e breaking her out
UNknown has put a hit on her that 's a one shot of keeping her alive
well you 'r e on a UNknown kind of damn lincoln
we UNknown l put 5 grand on your cake once this whole thing jumps off
the love of michael 's life is only worth of 5 000 ?
that 's the best we can do
that 's all we got
UNknown for you i know somebody who does the general 's man
he 's got the UNknown for sara 's hit
you wire that money to me by UNknown tomorrow and we 'r e in business
what is his name ?
it 's your brother to you that agony is
you should have seen the look on michael 's face
when he saw me fixing that fence and UNknown that camera
you did a great job
if michael has this misguided belief that sara 's life is in danger he 's gonna find a way back into that prison
your job will be over until you give us enough evidence to put him back behind bars
so what 's the latest ?
i know he 's breaking you out
UNknown sent me to kill you but after what he 's put me through i 'm done taking orders from him
you 'r e sitting next to me at the mess when i was poisoned
you 'd think you would UNknown e lasted this long if i wanted you dead ?
you 'r e still alive
don 't you think it 's hard to stay alive when you know who 's coming after you ?
there 's 200 women in this prison
bet do you even get to gen pop ?
i 'm coming with you
well if you 'r e watching this i 'm glad
because that means you 'r e safe
how does he think he 's gonna do this bro ?
he 's going to jump out of the plane
i know he 's gonna jump
the question is can he land ?
and how is he going to get out of cell block even if t bag
it 's a big if
trusting t bag is crazy
i 'm going to drop down into this outer area here
and i cut the parachute off before anyone can reach me
they 'r e going to be right on your ass
i can hide behind this building wait for a window
then i UNknown l make my way over here
well hopefully uh sara will be waiting
during the riot in UNknown 8 prison employees escaped through the administration building
they wound up here outside the fence
the administration building is connected to the chapel
which means that somewhere in that compound there is a UNknown exit
if we can get through it you can meet us there
how 's sara gonna get to the chapel ?
she UNknown l have to find a way
look we 'r e doing this at UNknown tonight just like we UNknown e planned
where have you been ?
what did i missed ?
i need you to find a plane and a pilot
and you two to take care of t bag
find out exactly who has this money and where they 'r e keeping it
and then we have to get it
or sara 's going to die in there
tell me you UNknown e completed your assignment
well i got the cash
but there UNknown l may be some delay in final delivery
the woman we hired is having trouble getting near sara UNknown
we 'r e about to play cards do you want in ?
with daddy gone you 'r e gonna need your backup
i UNknown e got uh a UNknown UNknown thing
not too smart though for a girl with a bounty on her head
aren 't you heard ?
UNknown you have a visitor
say hello to your husband for me
i know you don 't have any control over what 's happened here but uh
i 'm trying to find a way to to do this
but from where we 'r e standing right now there 's only one option
except pray for us tonight
you can pray for us to be together
maybe i UNknown l do the same
how can i rob someone if i UNknown e no clue who he is ?
the UNknown outside says that UNknown had one visitor yesterday
well if he was in the power deduction i 'd say daniels is your UNknown
and that means pretty ain 't got his mrs pretty
i ain 't talking about backing out the deal
we UNknown e got a pilot
went to charter business now
it 's a big difference michael
it 's not easy hitting the x especially at night
what do you got ?
those locks don 't have power protection which means you can UNknown them
1200 UNknown power UNknown will just set off the other alarms
not to mention that it UNknown l kill you
are we friends now ?
get out of the way !
what happened here ? !
but i hear it says fish
if you don 't like this guy we can still find someone else
good to see you UNknown
what you get into here UNknown ?
jumping off 1500 feet ain 't going to be easy
you UNknown e gone back on your word already ?
favor that i bust your old lady for UNknown
if anyone asks i was flying tourists to the keys
and it 's not my fault they jumped
if you don 't like this guy we 'd take a day
we come up with a new plan
no there 's no time alex
it 's not just sara 's life at risk
what do you need ?
if i don 't make it
i want you to make sure sara and my brother get out of the country alive
i need to know they 'r e gonna be okay
i don 't exactly know
it came via messenger from uh the lady side
my man on the outside needs to know who to call for the birthday present
who 's birthday is it ?
so this is joe daniels number right ?
is that enough information or you need a social security number too ?
i want that money wired to the account number UNknown
you boys do me wrong
i have no UNknown at all about singing it loud and clear you understand ?
she UNknown l meet you at san UNknown harbor in UNknown republic and then
i know where daniels is
and after we rob him i UNknown l take the money to UNknown green and uh wire to the bank
you will meet us at the airstrip right ?
see you on the other side
nobody 's talking huh ?
no one 's said any ?
i made it in the workshop
want to give to my daughter emily a birthday gift on her actual birthday
so i need to get out of here
you 'r e never sentimental
it 's just for her
there 's no way out of here right now
mr daniels american paint company
i 'm calling the police
i UNknown l be right back
keep your head down and follow me
i UNknown l think of something
you better think of something fast cause we have company
i hope you 'r e ready for a fight princess
this one 's to the death
i don 't think it 's her you have to worry about
i UNknown e got the message about the birthday present ?
was the gift earned ?
what in the hell are you talking about ?
i just thought of let you know how i came up with some green
my personal preference is two UNknown bars and a copy of the times
so i see you in the am ?
you worthless son of a whore
careful i don 't get there first
unless i become the king of that prison too
alright from takeoff the prison 's gonna come up real fast
so whatever you gotta do to get ready do it now
we UNknown e got the money
that means t bag 's set
i 'm goin to see how long it 's gonna take and we get going
you sure that thing 's gonna hold you up ?
yes it UNknown l be fine
think about all the amazing stories that you 'r e gonna tell your kid
you 'r e gonna be the type of father our dad never was
someone to look up to
and you can forget about getting your badge back
he 's got a plane
i swear to god he 's gonna be over
i want 20 armed cos in the yard
and be ready to turn off all exterior lights
UNknown won 't see what 's coming until it 's too late
what do you think happened with agatha it 's not what happened
i was hoping i 'd see you here
you know i still owe you one big juicy favor
i swear to god she wanted to kill me and i was just defending myself
my momma gave me that
told me i was going to give it to one of my kids one day
not only did i get knocked up but the girl in the family
and i practically raised agatha and she was no killer
now i can say that much for myself
you didn 't know what i had in mind yet
okay listen you 'r e right
agatha isn 't a killer
son of a bitch !
they coming right through here okay ?
i need to get inside right now
emergency team takes priority sir
i 'm the leader of the emergency team
go talk to your supervisor
the plane should be overhead any minute
we UNknown e just got the situation under control
we 'r e looking for her right now
they might be in the kitchen
i 'm not gonna make it on my own
either leave me with tools here or make up your damn mind
stood on the dark now !
you 'r e here alone ?
when i ask you a question you answer
i was worried about my little girl on the outside
so i came to pray
see if someone would watch over her
is hell a lot smarter than you
are you ready to go ?
nobody gets in or out of this prison
i don 't care if it 's the president having to take a piss you tell him to turn the hell around
michael said this is where they 'r e gonna come out
you think UNknown make the drop on time ?
what the hell you thinking you 'r e doing fish ?
we 'r e in UNknown
something 's going on in bitch block
what 's it worth to you to find out ?
we 'r e going to get through here ?
on the other side is a kind of an escape patch for the UNknown
in case of a riot
if this is the same system they have in fox river that door can only be open remotely from the centre control
tell them what you told me
michael UNknown is about to stage a prison break
and i know how he 's gonna do it
exactly what did UNknown asks you to do ?
just light a fire in my cell
and the rest the rest will just take care of itself
if that goes off what 's your protocol ?
hell he won 't go break i was goin to get you and escort her out
alright the evacuation 's only going to get him out in the yard
whatever he 's up to he needs noise and he needs chaos
UNknown the smoke detection system the fire alarm and while you 'r e at it kill the horn
if anybody so much as bends a blade of grass in this place
i want him to be able to hear it
why are we waiting for ?
with the right price t bag will set off the fire alarms
that 's what we 'r e waiting for
michael there 's a it 's okay
see there 's only one thing you can count on when you 'r e dealing with t bag
beyond this door should be a hundred yards of tunnel
on the other end of that is UNknown and after that there 's a boat mounted for the white sands and blue water
a power UNknown to the system will UNknown the reader for just a few seconds
just long enough for you to open that so get ready
i was afraid this might happen
we 'r e going to keep moving and we 'r e gonna find another way out of here
i know what i have to do
they should UNknown e been here by now
the battery wasn 't UNknown enough power
what do you want to try ?
this is the main fuse
if i yanked that everything will go dark for a second
i UNknown these two cables
if i UNknown these two cables there UNknown l be a lot of noise every light bulb in this place is going to blow
as soon as that happens you need to open that hatch
someone has to stay here and someone has to open the hatch
so i UNknown l leave it open for you
this is the only way
i 'm not leaving unless you 'r e coming with me
but i am coming with you
sara where is he ?
he 's not coming back
he 's not coming back
what do you mean he 's not coming back ?
what do you mean by that ?
he 's not coming back
he UNknown l be here
UNknown we UNknown e gotta go
we UNknown e gotta go
we UNknown e gotta go
why am i being punished ? !
i 'm the guy through the window !
you UNknown and UNknown an escape mr UNknown
michael asked me to give you this if he didn 't make it out
he said it would help you understand why he did what he did
this is the general 's money
i was supposed to wire it down to costa rica for you to pick up but uh
i ran into some trouble
you take care of that baby okay ?
he never said anything to me
why didn 't he just tell me ?
cause he knew you UNknown l try to stop him
he knew you do anything to protect your family
are you blind when you 'r e born ?
can you see in the dark ?
can you look at a king ?
would you sit on his throne ?
can you say of your bite that it 's worse than your bark ?

there 's a man over there with a look of surprise
as much as to say well now how about that ?
do i actually see with my own very eyes
a man who 's not heard of a jellicle cat ?
what 's a jellicle cat ?
what 's a jellicle cat ?
what 's a jellicle cat ?
the naming of cats is a difficult matter
it isn 't just one of your holiday games
you may think at first i 'm as mad as a hatter
when i tell you a cat must have three different names
first of all there 's the name that the family use daily
such as peter augustus alonzo or james
such as victor or jonathan george or bill bailey
all of them sensible everyday names
there are UNknown names if you think they sound sweeter
some for the gentlemen some for the dames
such as plato UNknown UNknown UNknown
but all of them sensible everyday names
but i tell you a cat needs a name that 's particular
a name that 's peculiar and more dignified
else how can he keep up his tail UNknown
or spread out his whiskers or cherish his pride ?
of names of this kind i can give you a quorum
such as UNknown UNknown or UNknown
such as UNknown or else UNknown
names that never belong to more than one cat
but above and beyond there 's still one name left over
and that is the name that you never will guess
the name that no human research can discover
but the cat himself knows and will never confess
when you notice a cat in profound meditation
the reason i tell you is always the same
his mind is engaged in a UNknown UNknown
of the thought of the thought
jellicle cats come out tonight
jellicle cats come one come all
the jellicle moon is shining bright
UNknown come to the jellicle ball
jellicle cats come out tonight
UNknown come to the jellicle ball
jellicle cats meet once a year
at the jellicle ball where we all rejoice
and the jellicle leader will soon appear
and make what is known as the jellicle choice
when old UNknown just before dawn
through a silence you feel you could cut with a knife
announces the cat who can now be reborn
and come back to a different jellicle life
for waiting up there is the UNknown layer
full of wonders one jellicle only will see
and UNknown ask because UNknown dare
who will it be ?
who will it be ?
i have a UNknown cat in mind
her coat is of the UNknown kind
with tiger stripes and leopard spots
all day she sits beneath the stair
or on the steps or on the mat
she sits and sits and sits and sits
and that 's what makes a UNknown cat
that 's what makes a UNknown cat
but when the day 's hustle and bustle is done
then the UNknown cat 's work is but hardly begun
and when all the family 's in bed and asleep
she UNknown up her skirts to the basement to creep
she is deeply concerned with the ways of the mice
their behaviour 's not good and their manners not nice
so when she has got them lined up on the UNknown
she teaches them music UNknown and UNknown
i have a UNknown cat in mind
the curtain cord she likes to wind
and tie it into sailor knots
she sits upon the window UNknown
or anything that 's smooth and flat
she sits and sits and sits and sits
and that 's what makes a UNknown cat
that 's what makes a UNknown cat
but when the day 's hustle and bustle is done
then the UNknown cat 's work is but hardly begun
she thinks that the cockroaches just need employment
to prevent them from idle and wanton UNknown
so she 's formed from that lot of disorderly UNknown
a troop of well disciplined helpful boy scouts
with a purpose in life and a good deed to do
and she 's even created
for she 's a jolly good fellow
the rum UNknown UNknown is a curious cat
if you offer me pheasant i 'd rather have grouse
if you put me in a house i would much prefer a flat
if you put me in a flat then i 'd rather have a house
if you set me on a mouse then i only want a rat
if you set me on a rat then i 'd rather chase a mouse
the rum UNknown UNknown is a curious cat
and there isn 't any call for me to shout it
for he will do as he do do
and there 's no doing anything about it
the rum UNknown UNknown is a terrible bore
when you let me in then i want to go out
i 'm always on the wrong side of every door
and as soon as i get home then i 'd like to get about
i like to lie in a bureau drawer
but i make such a fuss if i can 't get out
the rum UNknown UNknown is a curious cat
and there isn 't any use for you to doubt it
for he will do as he do do
and there 's no doing anything about it
the rum UNknown UNknown is a curious beast
my UNknown ways are a matter of habit
now if you offer me fish then i always want a feast
and if there isn 't any fish then i won 't eat rabbit
if you offer me cream then i sniff and sneer
so you catch me in it up to my ears and put it on the UNknown shelf
the rum UNknown UNknown is UNknown and knowing
the rum UNknown UNknown doesn 't care for a cuddle
so i UNknown l on up into your sewing
cos there 's nothing i enjoy like a horrible UNknown
the rum UNknown UNknown is a curious cat
the rum UNknown UNknown doesn 't care for a cuddle
the rum UNknown UNknown is a curious cat
and there isn 't any need for me to spout it
for he will do as he do do
in the light of the dawn
you see the border of her coat is torn
and you see the corner of her eye
twist like a crooked pin
she haunted many a low resort
near the UNknown road of UNknown court
she UNknown about the no man 's land
from the rising sun to the friend at hand
and the postman UNknown as he scratched his head
you 'd really have thought she 'd ought to be dead
UNknown jones is not skin and bones
in fact he 's remarkably fat
he doesn 't haunt UNknown he has eight or nine clubs
for he 's the st james 's street cat
he 's the cat we all greet as he walks down the street
in his coat of UNknown black
no commonplace UNknown have such well cut trousers
or such an impeccable back
in the whole of st james 's the smartest of names is
the name of this UNknown of cats
and we 'r e all of us proud to be UNknown or bowed to
by UNknown jones in white spats
in the whole of st james 's the smartest of names is
the name of this UNknown of cats
and we 'r e all of us proud to be UNknown or bowed to
by UNknown jones in white spats
my visits are occasional to the senior educational
and it is against the rules
for any one cat to belong both to that
and the joint superior schools
for a similar reason when game is in season
i 'm found not at fox 's but UNknown 's
i am frequently seen at the gay stage and screen
which is famous for UNknown and UNknown
in the season of venison i give my ben 's on
to the UNknown 's UNknown bones
and just before noon 's not a moment too soon
to drop in for a drink
when i 'm seen in a hurry there 's probably curry
at the siamese or at the glutton
if i look full of gloom then i UNknown e UNknown at the tomb
in the whole of st james 's the smartest of names is
the name of this UNknown of cats
and we 'r e all of us proud to be UNknown or bowed to
by UNknown jones in white
UNknown jones in white spats
so much in this way passes UNknown 's day
at one club or another he 's found
it can be no surprise that under our eyes
he has grown UNknown round
he 's a twenty five UNknown or i am a UNknown
and he 's putting on weight every day
but i 'm so well preserved because i UNknown e observed
all me life a routine and i 'd say
i am still in me prime i shall last out me time
that 's the word from this UNknown of cats
it must and it shall be spring in UNknown mall
while UNknown jones wears white
we 'r e a notorious couple of cats
as UNknown clowns quick change comedians
we have an extensive reputation
we make our home in victoria grove
this is merely our centre of operation
for we are incurably given to UNknown
when the family UNknown for sunday dinner
their minds made up that they won 't get thinner
on argentine joint potatoes and greens
and the cook would appear from behind the scenes
and say in a voice that is broken with sorrow
i 'm afraid you must wait and have dinner tomorrow
the joint has gone from the oven like that !
then the family will say it 's that horrible cat !
was it UNknown or UNknown !
and most of the time they leave it at that
have a wonderful way of working together
and some of the time you would say it was luck
and some of the time you would say it was weather
we 'd go through the house like a hurricane
and no sober person could take his oath
was it UNknown or UNknown ?
or could you have sworn that it might have been both ?
and when you hear a dining room smash
or up from the pantry there comes a loud crash
or down from the library came a loud ping
from a vase which was UNknown
then the family will say now which was which cat ?
and there 's nothing at all to be done about that
and there 's nothing at all to be done about that
i believe it is old UNknown
my mind may be wandering but i confess
i believe it is old UNknown
old UNknown 's lived a long time
he 's a cat who has lived many lives in succession
he was famous in proverb and famous in rhyme
a long while before queen victoria 's UNknown
old UNknown 's buried nine wives
and more i am tempted to say ninety nine
and his numerous UNknown UNknown and thrives
and the village is proud of him in his decline
at the sight of that placid and UNknown UNknown
when he sits in the sun
my mind may be wandering but i confess
i believe it is old UNknown
my mind may be wandering but i confess
i believe it is old UNknown
my mind may be wandering but i confess
i believe it is old UNknown
my legs may be UNknown and i must go slow
jellicle cats meet once a year
on the night we make the jellicle choice
and now that the jellicle leader is here
jellicle cats can all rejoice
of the awe full battle of the UNknown and the UNknown
of the participation of the UNknown and the UNknown
the UNknown and the UNknown everyone knows
are proud and UNknown passionate foes
it is always the same wherever one goes
and the UNknown and the UNknown are the most people say
that they do not like fighting yet once in a way
until you can hear them all over the park
now on the occasion of which i shall speak
almost nothing had happened for nearly a week and that 's a long time for a UNknown or a UNknown
the big police dog was away from his beat
i don 't know the reason but most people think
he slipped into the wellington arms for a drink
and no one at all was about on the street
when a UNknown and a UNknown happened to meet
they did not advance or exactly retreat
but they UNknown at each other and scraped their hind feet
and started to bark bark bark bark bark bark
until you could hear them all over the park
and they 'd bark bark bark bark bark bark
until you could hear them all over the park
now the UNknown although people may say what they please
is no british dog but a heathen chinese
and so all the UNknown when they heard the uproar
some came to the window some came to the door
there were surely a dozen more likely a score
and together they started to UNknown and UNknown
in their UNknown UNknown heathen chinese
but a terrible din is what UNknown like
for your UNknown dog is a UNknown yorkshire UNknown
there are dogs out of every nation the irish the welsh and the dane
the russian dutch and UNknown and even from china and spain
from the poodle the pom the UNknown
and the UNknown who walks on a chain
and to those that are UNknown and UNknown
that my meaning be perfectly plain
that my name is little tom UNknown and you better not do it again
and his UNknown scottish cousins are UNknown and UNknown
and every dog jack of them notable fighters
and so they stepped out with their pipers in order
playin when the blue UNknown come over the border
then the UNknown and the UNknown held no longer aloof
but some from the balcony some from the roof
joined into the din with a bark bark bark bark bark bark
until you could hear them all over the park
when these bold heroes together assembled
the traffic all stopped and the underground trembled
and some of the neighbours were so much afraid
that they started to ring up the fire brigade
when suddenly up from a small basement flat
why who should stalk out
but the great rumpus cat ?
he gave a great yawn
and his jaws were amazing
and when he looked out through the bars of the area
and what with the glare of his eyes and his yawning
the UNknown and the UNknown quickly took warning
he looked to the sky and he gave a great leap
and they every last one of them scattered like sheep
and when the police dog returned to his beat
there wasn 't a single one left on the street
when the blue UNknown come over the border
all hail and all bow to
jellicle cats and dogs all must
UNknown dogs and cats all must
jellicle cats come out tonight
jellicle cats come one come all
the jellicle moon is shining bright
UNknown come to the jellicle ball
jellicle cats are black and white
jellicle cats are rather small
jellicle cats are merry and bright
and pleasant to hear when we UNknown
jellicle cats have cheerful faces
jellicle cats have bright black eyes
we like to practise our airs and graces
and wait for the jellicle moon to rise
jellicle cats are not too big
jellicle cats are UNknown UNknown
we know how to dance a UNknown and a jig
until the jellicle moon appears
we make our UNknown and take our repose
UNknown wash behind their ears
UNknown dry between their toes
jellicle cats are white and black
jellicle cats are of moderate size
UNknown jump like a jumping jack
jellicle cats have moonlit eyes
we 'r e quiet enough in the morning hours
we 'r e quiet enough in the afternoon
to dance by the light of the jellicle moon
jellicle cats are black and white
jellicle cats as we said are small
if it happens to be a stormy night
we will practise a caper or two in the hall
if it happens the sun is shining bright
you would say we had nothing to do at all
we are resting and saving ourselves to be right
for the jellicle moon and the jellicle ball
jellicle cats come out tonight
jellicle cats come one come all
the jellicle moon is shining bright
UNknown come to the jellicle ball
jellicle cats come out tonight
jellicle cats come one come all
the jellicle moon is shining bright
UNknown come to the jellicle ball
you see the border of her coat
is torn and stained with sand
the corner of her eye
not a sound from the pavement
has the moon lost her memory ?
the withered leaves collect at my feet
and the street lamp gutters
all alone in the moonlight
i can smile at the old days
i remember the time i knew
and approach to the meaning
UNknown the experience in a different form
we can assign to happiness
turn your face to the moonlight
let your memory lead you
the meaning of what happiness is
turn your face to the moonlight
let your memory lead you
the meaning of what happiness is
gus is the cat at the theatre door
his name as i ought to have told you before
but that 's such a fuss to pronounce
that we usually call him just gus
his coat 's very shabby he 's thin as a rake
and he suffers from UNknown that makes his paws shake
yet he was in his youth quite the smartest of cats
but no longer a terror to mice or to rats
for he isn 't the cat that he was in his prime
though his name was quite famous he says in his time
and whenever he joins his friends at their club
which takes place at the back of the UNknown pub
he loves to UNknown them if someone else pays
with UNknown drawn from his UNknown days
for he once was a star of the highest degree
he has acted with irving he has acted with tree
and he likes to relate his success on the halls
where the gallery once gave him
the fiend of the fell
i have played in my time
and i used to know seventy speeches by heart
i knew how to gag
and i knew how to let the cat out of the bag
i knew how to act with my back and my tail
with an hour of rehearsal i never could fail
i 'd a voice that would soften the hardest of hearts
whether i took the lead or in character parts
i have sat by the bedside of poor little nell
when the curfew was rung then i swung on the bell
in the pantomime season i never fell flat
and i once UNknown dick UNknown 's cat
the fiend of the fell
then if someone will give him a UNknown of gin
he will tell how he once played a part in east lynne
at a shakespeare performance he once walked on pat
when some actor suggested the need for a cat
and i say that these kittens they do not get trained
as we did in the days when victoria UNknown
they never get drilled in a regular troupe
and they think they are smart just to jump through a hoop
and he says as he scratches himself with his claws
well the theatre is certainly not what it was
these modern productions are all very well
but there 's nothing to equal from what i hear tell
the fiend of the fell
music fades away ghostly wind
but there 's nothing to equal
from what i hear tell
the cat of the railway train
there 's a whisper down the line at eleven thirty nine
when the night mail 's ready to depart
saying UNknown where is UNknown ?
has he gone to hunt the UNknown ?
we must find him or the train can 't start
all the guards and all the porters and the UNknown 's daughters
would be searching high and low
saying UNknown where is UNknown ?
for unless he 's very UNknown
then the night mail just can 't go
at eleven forty two with the signal overdue
and the passengers all frantic to a man
that 's when i would appear and i 'd UNknown to the rear
i 'd been busy in the luggage van
then he gave one flash of his glass green eyes
and the signal went all clear
they 'd be off at last for the northern part
the cat of the railway train
you could say that by and large it was me who was in charge
of the sleeping car express
from the driver and the guards to the UNknown playing cards
i 'd supervise them all more or less
down the corridor he paces and UNknown all the faces
of the travellers in the first and the third
he UNknown control by a regular patrol
and he 'd know at once if anything occurred
he would watch you without UNknown and he saw what you were thinking
and it 's certain that he didn 't approve
of UNknown and riot so that folk were very quiet
when UNknown was about and on the move
you could play no pranks with UNknown
he 's a cat that cannot be ignored
so nothing went wrong on the northern mail
it was very pleasant when they found their little den
with their name written up on the door
and the berth was very neat with a newly folded sheet
and not a speck of dust on the floor
there was every sort of light you could make it dark or bright
and a button you could turn to make a breeze
and a funny little basin you 'r e supposed to wash your face in
and a crank to shut the window should you sneeze
then the guard looked in politely and would ask you very brightly
do you like your morning tea weak or strong ?
but i was just behind him and was ready to remind him
for UNknown won 't let anything go wrong
when they crept into their cosy berths
and pulled down the UNknown
they ought to reflect it was very nice
to know that they wouldn 't be bothered by mice
they would leave all that to the railway cat
the cat of the railway train
the cat of the railway train
the cat of the railway train
in the watches of the night i was always fresh and bright
every now and then i 'd have a cup of tea
with perhaps a drop of scotch when i was keeping on the watch
only stopping here and there to catch a flea
they were fast asleep at UNknown and so they never knew
that i was walking up and down the station
they were sleeping all the while i was busy at carlisle
where i met the station master with UNknown
they might see me at UNknown if i summoned the police
if there was anything they ought to know about
when they got to UNknown there they did not have to wait
gives you a wave of his long brown tail
which says i UNknown l see you again
you will meet without fail on the midnight mail
the cat of the railway train
the cat of the railway
UNknown 's a mystery cat
he 's called the hidden paw
for he 's the master criminal
who can defy the law
he 's the UNknown of scotland yard
the flying squad 's despair
for when they reach the scene of crime
UNknown 's not there !
UNknown UNknown there 's no one like UNknown
he 's broken every human law
he breaks the law of gravity
would make a UNknown stare
and when you reach the scene of crime
you may seek him in the basement
you may look up in the air
but i tell you once and once again UNknown 's not there !
UNknown 's a ginger cat
he 's very tall and thin
you would know him if you saw him
for his eyes are sunken in
his brow is deeply lined with thought
his head is highly UNknown
his coat is dusty from neglect
he UNknown his head from side to side
with movements like a snake
and when you think he 's half asleep
he 's always wide awake
UNknown UNknown there 's no one like UNknown
for he 's a fiend in UNknown shape
you may meet him in a by street
you may see him in the square
but when a crime 's discovered then UNknown 's not there
i know he cheats at cards
and his footprints are not found in
any files of scotland yard 's
and when the UNknown 's looted
or the jewel case is UNknown
or when the milk is missing
or another UNknown 's been UNknown
or the greenhouse glass is broken
and the trellis past repair
there 's the wonder of the thing UNknown 's not there !
UNknown UNknown there 's no one like UNknown
there never was a cat
of such UNknown and UNknown
he always has an alibi
and one or two to spare
whatever time the deed took place UNknown wasn 't there
and they say that all the cats
whose wicked deeds are widely known
are nothing more than agents
for the cat who all the time
the napoleon of crime !
UNknown UNknown there 's no one like UNknown
he 's a fiend in UNknown shape
you may meet him in a by street
you may see him in the square
cats whisper UNknown 's not there
you ought to ask magical mr UNknown
the original UNknown cat there can be no doubt about that
please listen to me and don 't UNknown
all his inventions are off his own bat
there 's no such cat in the metropolis he holds all the patent UNknown
the greatest UNknown have something to learn
from mr UNknown UNknown turn
well i never was there ever a cat so clever
he is quiet he is small he is black
from his ears to the tip of his tail
he can creep through the UNknown crack
he can walk on the UNknown rail
he can pick any card from the pack
he 's equally cunning with dice
he 's always deceiving you into believing
that he 's only hunting for mice
he can play any trick with a cork
or a spoon and a bit of fish paste
if you look for a knife or a fork
and you think that it 's merely misplaced
you have seen it one moment but then it is gone
but you find it next week laying out on the lawn
well i never was there ever a cat so clever
well i never was there ever a cat so clever
well i never was there ever a cat so clever
his manner is vague and aloof
and you would think there was nobody UNknown
but his voice can be heard on the roof
while he was UNknown up by the fire
and he 's sometimes been heard by the fire
while he was about on the roof
at least we all heard that somebody UNknown
of his singular magical powers
and i UNknown e known the family to call
him in from the garden for hours
while he was asleep in the hall
and not long ago this phenomenal cat
right out of a hat
well i never was there ever a cat so clever
and not long ago this phenomenal cat
was there ever a cat so clever
well i never was there ever a cat so clever
well i never was there ever a cat so clever
well i never was there ever a cat so clever
see the dew on a UNknown
and a rose that is fading
i yearn to turn my face to the dawn
through a silence you feel you could cut with a knife
announces the cat who can now be reborn
turn your face to the moonlight
let your memory lead you
the meaning of what happiness is
all alone in the moonlight
i can smile at the old days
a time i knew what happiness was
burnt out ends of smoky days
i must wait for the sunrise
i must think of the new life
and i mustn 't give in
tonight will be a memory too
it 's so easy to leave me
all alone with the memory
of my days in the sun
you UNknown l understand what happiness is
up up up past the russell hotel
up up up up to the UNknown layer
up up up past the russell hotel

up up up past the jellicle moon
up up up up to the UNknown layer
you UNknown e heard of several kinds of cat
and my opinion now is that
you should need no interpreter
you UNknown e learned enough to take the view
that cats are very much like you
you UNknown e seen us both at work and games
and learnt about our proper names
our habits and our UNknown
your memory i UNknown l UNknown
your memory i UNknown l UNknown
some say one rule is true
don 't speak till you
myself i do not hold with that
i say you should address a cat
and taking off your hat
before a cat will UNknown
to treat you as a trusted friend
some little token of esteem
is needed like a dish of cream
and you might now and then supply
some caviar or UNknown pie
some UNknown grouse or salmon paste
he 's sure to have his personal taste
and so in time you reach your aim
a cat 's entitled to expect
and there 's how you address a cat
a cat 's entitled to expect
and there 's how you address
everything okay down there ?
now relax i 'm a professional
okay now your UNknown are down because of a power UNknown or a grid UNknown or maybe even a bomb

the first was an executive at UNknown a major credit bureau
they both received tips to buy stocks
now once the person is hooked on making easy money we think they start receiving instructions
last week we found another
an it administrator at the department of defense
she made a million dollars buying stocks before a co worker noticed her receiving unusual text messages
then one night she receives a message and shuts down the UNknown to the pentagon 's UNknown
who sent the messages ?
the UNknown on the UNknown are always blank and UNknown
but they 'r e all dead

someone 's still hurting from a bad break up
i bounced around a lot

i don 't show any UNknown access sir
i want to know how they did it and who it was
well i can UNknown UNknown
it 's gonna take me some time to UNknown the
it can access any security system on the planet
i know what echelon 's capable of
i need to know who can hack into it
well someone with some serious UNknown
my guess is a foreign power maybe even an UNknown
what are the nsa 's plans ?
well they UNknown e gotta keep a lid on this thing now
they UNknown e got the phone so they UNknown l try and trace the messages without peterson
you said there were others who 'd received messages
yes but the selection seems random
he UNknown l lead us to who 's doing this
what makes you think he hasn 't served his purpose already ?
because he isn 't dead yet
sir the nsa is not gonna tolerate an outside investigation
john just keep him alive
otherwise you UNknown l have worse than the UNknown deal with
if there 's a line of sight which i doubt it UNknown l be from a distance
what about reed and peterson ?
they UNknown l stay quiet sir

transit trunk UNknown bravo four 's active
target UNknown just went active
i hope you don 't mind
what are you reading ?
did you know that the nsa UNknown every phone call we make ?
every UNknown every text ?
i guess i just assumed that
yeah well that 's just what exists now
the UNknown that failed would UNknown e put a camera in every person 's home
okay now you just sound paranoid
see the UNknown would UNknown e UNknown
echelon to operate in every computer on the net
worst of all there 'd be no stopping it
not unless you turn off every computer in the world
and this only failed by one vote
i never said i was from omaha
who the hell do you work for ?
he 's with the girl
they 'r e in the back
are you all right ?
get him out of here

stupid sons of bitches !
i told them not to turn off the phone okay ?
it said it was gonna kill me
look it wasn 't them all right ?
all right so what do we do ?
look you don 't hide from these guys
what we UNknown e gotta do is figure out who 's behind this and let 's see if nsa UNknown l cut a deal
how are we supposed to do that ?
he said with my UNknown he could find out who 's sending the messages
look i think this is a little bit out of his league
besides he 's already skipped town
hopped a plane back to moscow
i 'm gonna call him
you 'r e not calling anybody
so we go to moscow
me and you go to moscow right now
if you got a better idea spit it out !
you know what i UNknown l go myself
look buddy you would not be alive right now if it wasn 't for me
i am not gonna be alive if i don 't get some answers soon
where the hell do you think you 'r e gonna go ?
they UNknown e got your phone remember ?
and i UNknown e got your UNknown card information
she really went above and beyond didn 't she ?
yeah i 'd say she did
she risked her life protecting you
you know a lot of women that would do that for you ?
can you get me to moscow or not ?
mueller can but i don 't know how we 'r e gonna convince him to do that
russian cabbie can do what the nsa can 't ?
yuri says he has equipment
that 's not good enough
listen back at UNknown we bought UNknown UNknown from the russians
they have things we don 't have shit the chinese and UNknown don 't have
i don 't know how they got it but they 'r e UNknown in
but what makes you think we can trust this guy ?
this is where we 'r e going
why you need fasten ?
cause it 's the law
you do that police stop us
they 'r e in moscow
you come to moscow after all
it 's my UNknown info
you just happen to pick max up at the airport know all about his phone and then UNknown help him ?
i don 't send messages sir i swear
you bring UNknown all this way
let me find out who 's sending messages
we UNknown e got to trust somebody
just give me three hours
you 'r e awful quiet
it 's just strange being here
this was cold war central when i started at the bureau
you were in the fbi with grant ?
did you like it ?
so why 'd you leave ?
i had a big mouth
patriot act was up for UNknown
i was pushing for UNknown UNknown
burke at UNknown to fast track approval
he didn 't appreciate having somebody on the inside speaking out
he had grant take care of that
what good is freedom of speech if you can 't use it ?
you can 't just leave
reed you don 't strike me as the kind of guy who 's gonna be happy guarding people 's money in a prague casino
look i 'm taking care of myself
then what are you doing here ?
getting paid to find out who 's doing this
and you don 't care who it is UNknown ?
i just think you feel sorry for yourself
let 's just get back okay ?
so who 's sending the messages ?
you won 't like answer
this is entire UNknown output stream for all messages sent to UNknown
nobody used echelon to send messages
you gotta be kidding me
that 's your explanation ?
that 's your explanation ?
i knew you wouldn 't believe me
you 'r e damn right i don 't believe you
you tell me if i could do this
this list is all echelon UNknown cross containing UNknown information and name max peterson
first i sub sort for information UNknown to flight UNknown
night before you receive phone echelon intercepted fuel analysis at UNknown airport bangkok
test results indicate fuel UNknown UNknown maximum but fuel UNknown reports normal UNknown
echelon knew flight UNknown would crash
yes with probability of 94 67
day of crash echelon UNknown UNknown
UNknown chairman of board of UNknown corporation
UNknown was li lin chao director of UNknown
our board has UNknown your bid
anyone with access to echelon could UNknown e done that
maybe so but only computer could have known that two of empire casino 's high paying UNknown would pay off in one night
and the blackjack tables ?
it just watched table and calculated probability of blackjack or dealer going bust
no human can count that fast
echelon can access any security camera in world
nobody used echelon to send messages
so if max has phone it has max
reed let 's talk !
UNknown i wasn 't trying to kill you
it 's on his ankle
all right on UNknown grant !
let 's go move it !
it will only deal with you
you got a funny way of showing it
until it resumes contact we 'r e stuck on
what do you mean it ?
we believe that echelon may be sending the messages itself
will you help us peterson ?
will you help us ?
can i trust you ?
of course you can trust me
i said can i trust you ?
max what are you doing ?
can i trust you ?
you quit fucking around man
you can trust me !
give me that goddamn thing
what does it say ?
what the hell does that mean ?
it 's a zip code
sir the nsa has UNknown the information on the omaha facility
the facility is a converted hangar bought by a start up planning to lease UNknown
that ring a bell ?
i remember it was a strange building to house UNknown in
yeah apparently so did the potential clients
the company was sold at auction before they even opened
the place hasn 't been entered since time of sale
we 'r e still trying to locate the current owner
what 'd you do there ?
same thing i always do
installed UNknown level UNknown UNknown
i always thought you were a little stupid
you mean stupid like build a UNknown knows absolutely everything then lose control of it ?
we UNknown l take UNknown here
what the hell is authorize UNknown ?
it opens the UNknown for access so outside data can get in
why would it want that ?
but it will allow us to see what 's on the UNknown
they can prevent any existing files on the drives from getting out
try not to fuck it up max
i UNknown l use my UNknown password
command structure for boot up is in UNknown and the drives are UNknown but they haven 't seen any data
get him on the line
that 's gonna be difficult
get the men out of here
we UNknown l catch up
all right you got it
who 's stuart wallace ?
his credit card bought your phone
one of the other UNknown
i got a bad feeling about this
what 's going on ?
it 's no longer here sir
are you trying to tell me our UNknown dollar program just got up and left ? !
on its own ? !
what the hell are you looking at ? !
all right so that 's why it picked you
it wanted to move and you were the only one with the key
yeah but to get out past the nsa UNknown it would UNknown e needed
why does it even need to leave nsa at all ?
what could it possibly do here that it couldn 't do there ?
well there 's your answer
sir come take a look at this
congress wouldn 't allow it so it 's giving it to itself
this is a temporary house
long enough to take residence in every computer on the net
i mean it UNknown l be UNknown
it looks like financial records
the fourth UNknown worked at UNknown

yeah i 'm sure you are
have you thought of the consequences ?
this thing has killed four people already
but spencer UNknown me it 's UNknown because it hasn 't been permitted to follow its original UNknown
giving it the UNknown will cure that
once it 's installed you UNknown l have no control over it
we 'r e at war reed
if the computer acts UNknown on occasion that 's a small price to pay
it 's on our side
no don 't bet on that
peterson thinks he can shut it down without losing any of the money and i 'm gonna let him
you 'r e forgetting yourself mister

i 'm sorry sir i have to go against you on this
i 'm UNknown peterson to shut it down
if you so much as touch one key on that computer so help me god
i UNknown l have you hauled up UNknown and watch your ass hang in the public square

so what do you think ?
if i can get my old office back
that old office i had in the corner with the view ?
he 's a hard man to say no to especially when he wants to keep a story off the front page
he sent you all this way just to tell me that ?
and to give you this
he said you deserved it
i don 't know what to say
well the check 's in UNknown
i figure it 's as good a place as any to cash it
in the name of god the most merciful UNknown UNknown
muhammad the messenger of god to emperor UNknown of UNknown
greetings to those who follow the path of good
please listen to the divine call
said the messenger of god to his people accept islam for your salvation

coming from the desert smelling camel and goat to tell the king of persia where you kneel !
muhammad the messenger of god
who gave you this authority ?
scholars and UNknown of islam university of al UNknown egypt the higher UNknown in UNknown approved the fidelity and accuracy of this film
the producers of this film have respected the tradition
UNknown view that the UNknown of the prophet UNknown of the offending message why not show the person of muhammad
600 years after christ 's death when europe was plunged into the dark ages and old UNknown fell
muhammad was born in mecca UNknown a rich trading city controlled by an UNknown increasing its housing wealth gods
every year during the great exhibition
priests leave their idols and gods the custody of the UNknown
the holy temple of abraham the UNknown was now the home of UNknown to host more than 360 different gods
already have the gain of the day ?
no but this year is the best with the gods and the gain is not bad eh ! more gods to the UNknown
the caravan of UNknown !
seem to have run they must be thirsty put more men in the spring
i give them as many sheep 70 ? give 100 we must not UNknown our reputation for hospitality
and lambs for 10 heads
the poets take water in the house of UNknown where the verse and prose are killed every night
make way for poetry lovers for abu UNknown enthusiastic and wealthy patron of the arts
when abu UNknown calls the poet the joy and love come together all the joys and songs start when abu UNknown calls the poet
from UNknown in china my wife as you can see a pleasure for the eyes
yes give me seven long there are 20 UNknown
the gods of the UNknown is their maintenance costs
who is that man who inspected my soul ?
you can not stop it ?
with a rich wife could have the best
a man who dares to provoke the god of health
al UNknown to UNknown the god of prosperity
al UNknown the god of families and tribes
UNknown and that protects the caravan from and UNknown our fate
yes i believe that muhammad is going to be hurt
what sadness i feel when the great exhibition may not see the next
return of mount UNknown muhammad ?
it 's there for three days !
no we have not seen
UNknown thought would happen here the way home
and still up there ?
i fear for him when he is on the mountain
because i do not know what it means
in the name of the lord who created man teach you what this man does not know
still shivering under the blanket
UNknown ! what happened to my nephew in the mountains ?
and muhammad replied i do not read
maybe it was gabriel or a dream
when muhammad returned from the mountain saw the angel gabriel in the form of man in the background
no matter where i looked there it was
and gabriel returned to say
i am gabriel and you 'r e the muhammad messenger of god
who told you this ?
i 'm their adopted son
be careful whom you talk
god says to moses he spoke through a bush on
stop your nephew or what we will do
poor against the rich sons against fathers
as arabs we obey our parents children are not teachers
how soon can be said the prophet of god ?
the bones of a dead person can relive he says
because the creator of man can UNknown
the gods could leave and benefit to another city
tell him we UNknown l give you power charge the keys of the UNknown and all the money he wants
tell him we UNknown l give you what you request
do not let an old man like me bear more than it can bear
i had you in my arms as a child
i can not see you hurt
even if you put the sun and the moon in my hands not give up my mail that comes from god
i am your father and obey me as long as i live !
could branded exalted if i get drunk if you play
prefer a brother like that !
you are all my children
i gave all i could but apparently not enough
give more to the whole world
get him out of here father
they argue that it is an invention why not again ?
in mecca it is new
god has already said before
but people forget and it changed
now god repeats muhammad and returns to be new
what have you brought with you ?
the words of god himself
when you get to the sun and falling stars and the mountains disappear and camels are abandoned
the following wild animals seas and grow when UNknown the souls and newborn girl wonder why he was buried alive
when you open the books and separating the heavens
then every soul will know how to act
your mother was worried sorry father
where were you ? with muhammad again ?
forgive it was my fault
that god has always helped
what you UNknown ideas ?
that the true god is invisible
is not made of clay
UNknown we see the gods in the UNknown every day
listen to people who hurt you
listen to muhammad muhammad is generous itself
is always with a smile but spreads dangerous ideas
there should not be hungry !
that the rich should not UNknown the poor !
that the strong should not UNknown the weak !
that women should be able choose or reject a marriage !
to stop the burial of newborn girls !
i was lucky with your mother
yes but we hardly got to know UNknown
and you have not born
UNknown like to bury my sister
but my father was unable to do so
when i was born my father screamed that he could not do so again
the gods who let these things are not gods !
i promised to go to the home of muhammad pray there
muhammad can not read or write but can we talk
these are the words of god not theirs
a god who speaks !
muhammad speaks only for himself
muhammad transmitted the words of god to write
hides under a blanket with my eyes closed
but with his heart open
muhammad did not understand that we live of the gods of the UNknown ?
every year come arabian tribes to mecca to pray and to buy think that would replace 300 gods for a single invisible it is everywhere even on the moon ?
what would then be mecca ?
the gods are our worship and our income
you can buy and sell god
boy you UNknown l win a few lashes
muhammad taught that a slave was equal to his master
muhammad said all men are equal before god
teach the difference between a lord of mecca and a slave
UNknown tale face to his mouth to learn a lesson
they will kill you !
look who caused anarchy !
infected to the slaves !
if you believe in the gods remember that they are the gods of your master
i bought your humanity when you paid for
there is only one god
who is stronger now ?
your love and your god ?
there is only one god
they ended up with ?
there is only one god
swear that slave preached !
abu UNknown paid 100 UNknown for this slave
if the price rises of the slaves we swim alone next year !
take him back no longer serves me i 'm done with it
god said to announce the messenger of islam
open the windows the world heard emerged from the darkness know the word of god and his messenger there is one god and muhammad is his messenger
go to the UNknown !
god is great out of darkness
join our march towards the UNknown !
muhammad and islam rebellion called shall take hold of our gods !
we will defend the UNknown to the gods !
there is only one god and muhammad is the messenger of god
there is only one god and muhammad is the messenger of god
UNknown UNknown now are only 30 no !
in the name of god the most merciful
we do not believe in these gods
salt of the UNknown !
your prophet is a fraud kill him !
if you do not stop talking !
how to talk about truth or lie if he said anything yet ?
hit me back if you dare !
i belong to the religion of my nephew
who has the courage to fight to do it with me !
muhammad a night in the desert
i realize that god is not safe
who would have believed that UNknown their wines and their hunt would join muhammad !
the more you hit attracting more people !
how can an illiterate that can climb the mountain and back to three days full of poetry ?
says they are words of god how to fight someone whose force do not understand ?
muhammad promised paradise that found by your audience
we will be less eager to hear
who is your god answer !
say it 's your god UNknown
there is only one god and muhammad is the messenger of god
UNknown your father and your mother are the first martyrs of islam
how much they are willing to suffer ?
the prophet said that we should stay at mecca
if you are killed one by one
muhammad said that UNknown is a christian king in whose country does not commit UNknown
praise the lord come on !
follow in his footsteps and suddenly disappeared
only weaker left ruin our reputation
we can not afford a scandal
you could use that friendship ?
we will give you anything you ask
i do not know where to begin
you have our friendship you can start it
some slaves have escaped to your kingdom
we will refund your slave like you would with our own
there is turmoil in arabia ?
there are religious rebels all religions were UNknown
the bodies of slaves are available but jesus is our shepherd and our souls are his sheep
betrayed the religion of their parents follow a lunatic called prophet
i can not hear them without souls chained
dug his own grave by failing slope
not bow to their prophet ?
muhammad is a man just us prostrate before god
UNknown what makes miracles muhammad ?
if a prophet UNknown the sky with miracles
true the prophets miracles so we can recognize them
muhammad is the miracle of the holy UNknown
a book written by a illiterate and UNknown to god !
at UNknown god sent the apostles tongues of fire to speak all languages these miracles exist today ?
i think not enough is enough have not supported their reasons
during the persecution in mecca muhammad told us to go to UNknown
the land of the king right !
it is a deserved punishment
because you and we believe in the book of one god and will protect us
is like drinking water from a mirage !
for years we UNknown images of wood and stone ignoring the existence of god
there were no laws of heaven
the rich to the poor and ignorant piety natural that a man feels for the other is accused of UNknown the order !
against all this UNknown man has reached a chosen by god and who believe !
is out of it i ask you to be serene
we are an ancient civilization
called wood and stone the gods is ignorant !
it is not the idol and the figure which but cherish the spirit
buy feed use and to exclude women and are equal to us ?
god created man from a man and a woman
UNknown you must respect the womb that gave you life !
why their gods are mute 300 and this god is telling ?
abraham noah moses and jesus christ
why not now believe that speaks to us through muhammad ?
who taught him those names ?
muhammad is a keeper of flocks !
jesus christ and a carpenter what they say christ and muhammad are rays a single lamp
you believe in three gods
father son and holy spirit
what to know christ ?
that god can not have a child
our prophet taught us that the holy spirit entered the womb of a virgin named mary who conceived christ the apostle of god
he said the son of god !
what the UNknown says jesus birth ?
let me repeat the words of the holy UNknown
in the name of god UNknown UNknown in the book UNknown the story of mary
how to give birth to a child if no man has touched me ?
what the lord says it will
he will be a signal for men and a sign of our mercy and was ordained
this is intolerable muhammad creates unrest even abroad
treated as an alien !
his uncle UNknown protects well
his entire family will be dropped once the desert !
anyone trading with them !
not own any land !
do not give them shelter or food !
do not marry a woman until it UNknown !
these were the worst years of muhammad
for three years suffered elements of the desert
although the year but had not yet arrived
his first wife died UNknown and then his protector abu UNknown
until the last moment abu UNknown tried to reconcile the UNknown of mecca with muhammad !
only asked a few words
if only it were words had given him ten !
but the words he wants UNknown an all gods
but the children of that city were throwing stones
this was muhammad for the most bitter days of his life
then UNknown when their mission seemed to fail the situation has changed
a delegation from the rich but UNknown UNknown city went to see it at night asked him to UNknown between UNknown involved in UNknown civil strife and war
muhammad accepted on one condition
to believe in one god !
meeting this commitment means separate the rest of arabia ! we are enemies of our brothers
this commitment means war our gods are firewood that 's what it means
if you accept no return because muhammad is the messenger we announced the jews
i doubt that will be now !
those who do not follow me
we deliver to the only god you and muhammad the messenger of god it belongs to us and we belong !
testimony that there is no god but god and you 'r e the muhammad messenger of god
muhammad remained in the mecca ran the greatest danger until all followers departed
muhammad became a nation received a city held commitments
and you UNknown king of medina last night you lost your kingdom !
should you worry about abu UNknown something every time you shop to UNknown need to stagger him
and what do you think ?
until we get rid of him to save their way of life
and in the meantime ?
accept his call i think i gave him privileges
king UNknown praying five times a day ?
i do not think so !
it may not be necessary
seven young people from different families among them is my son UNknown stabbed him together
where is the fault if the responsibility for his death is shared between several families ?
muhammad 's body contains too much
his cousin ali was lying on his bed to die in their place ?
who we are facing ?
will not go away !
the roads are being watched
hundred camels to the man who brings muhammad alive or dead !
abu UNknown and his UNknown guide
no grazing for their camels
medina is to the north
they mark the footprints not me
they say you can trace a bird just smell the air
we will go with them
if you leave here we UNknown l take you to mecca alive !
not here the web is intact and birds here would nest if there is someone in the cave
we should have gone north !
the tissue was all of a spider what was between muhammad and death
but his fate was being murdered
the guide led the UNknown in their flight through the desert and the hot days of june
in the medina waited to welcoming but fearful for their trip
he said a man and no man can survive this heat
i can see myself obliged to break free as a token of kindness
welcome to medina the city blessed their city messenger of god !
stay with me the messenger of god ?
i own the best home in medina
give me the honor to meet you stay with me !
how can the prophet choose between many
will your home where god decides to stop the camel
the choice of a camel could not offend anyone
here we build the house of the prophet and first place for prayer and prayer the first mosque of islam god is great !
look to the prophet of god loading bricks
look you too makes this we will
look i went to look any further
there are a lot of blood on the drum
why not the human voice ?
if the prophet is in agreement
you have good voice use it
testimony that there is no god but allah
testimony that there is no god but allah
witness that muhammad is the messenger of allah
witness that muhammad is the messenger of allah
come to good to good action UNknown n UNknown
today a man from medina to mecca a hug !
each one will share with the other half !
let 's embrace our brother !
i 'm sick of this politics of kissing slaves prophets should worry about the UNknown
how is my child ?
we will burn your hands otherwise we remove burn the house
UNknown UNknown as a king
loyalty to islam is above the family and the tribe he said
that all UNknown are brothers
do not be led astray !
the real danger is here said the neighbor is equal to a same
that jews and christians are equal to UNknown
protect the jews that come to us
the next step is to give rights to the horse !
this lunatic already gave them !
it has been our children our future their rights are our crimes
this time not only will your family
take all values who have left in mecca your carpets houses its silver
and grown the caravan to damascus
i bring news from mecca !
be stolen everything they left behind !
the shops of abu UNknown and the house of the prophet were sold each fee or canvas everything they owned was brought to market
are a people without possessions !
not even fight for you ?
what other choice is UNknown ?
when the prophet says fight we will do so
they are a peace loving people too lenient !
you are the messenger of god tease was abused and we do nothing we are not good warriors but to guide the ambition us and god and you
prophet is the sword but hate how
we must face them !
stole our belongings and lead to damascus right in front of our noses
sorry i get carried away
that weird watching the sun
it is not the time for noon prayer !
but the way of god against those who attack UNknown from their because the persecution is worse than death
fight until the religion is for god but if they stop
no more war for god UNknown not those who initiate wars fight in the way of god against those who attacked
you can not hurt women and children or elderly or disabled nor the man who till the land
you can not cut trees attack only those who have taken that have stolen their rights and UNknown with their possessions
you must fight even if your child is UNknown with them
mecca is more important than your family
let the future come just
UNknown is not a coward
every man in his place
send us your best men
my son UNknown and me !
we consider your peers ?
the prophet saw you and orders that you should not tie the prisoners
and give them water and share your food with them
and if you walk walk hand in hand
the prophet said that the prisoner release to teach reading to 10 UNknown
why not be long ?
why blame me with or without reason
UNknown should have gone but except for the caravan and thus our future
why i sing the name my father and my brother ?
with my nails i UNknown l give you an eye for an eye
hunting the hunter of lions
UNknown will be my prey
and when you 'r e dead you eat the liver
we cut to pieces UNknown
we cut to pieces UNknown
this regret can not continue
we will do whatever it takes
it will be a plague ?
in which city we arrived ?
one could fill their pockets here
they stopped in mecca ?
it 's on the road
no response to my question
they stopped in mecca ?
of course we stopped to rest the camels
what is said in the desert ?
are being brought together in mecca
they are preparing a very strong army
they are calling for his courage
in mecca there is music in every house
i want to show an UNknown slave
i UNknown l give you your weight in silver
and your height in a shot silk of these
very soon we will know how many there are
it is a great army 3 000 men hundreds of horses
that was a year ago
have come to avenge UNknown
come to those killed in UNknown
you can see it is that UNknown ?
the riders at the edge ?
has sent 50 archers to watch
whatever happens the archers should contain riders
UNknown tell the prophet that we are ready
despite that we triple the number
i would say it is a fair fight
we can see them and us
i 'm not afraid of what lies ahead of me
come back come back !
go for the loot !
do not leave their places
return to their positions !
where is the prophet ?
we owe the victory to you UNknown
there is no victory if muhammad lives
it 's in the mountains but fulfilling the mission
we can stop it forever !
is protected has the advantage of the mountain
one day for a day !
today we are avenged of UNknown !
our dead have responded to yours !
UNknown you hear me ?
i remember UNknown ? how to kill my father and my brother
you 'r e also dead now !
UNknown you hear me ?
but not yet finished with you death is too little
UNknown ! open the UNknown
lose a battle and work even harder
if you exceed the logic even feel happy about having lost
fight for the sky and take what they want
mecca is more than its land is where god spoke to man
yearn to mecca with all his soul
abu UNknown kill in the wilderness
if you believe in god as they do may not happen
i agree with you probably killed
not to allow any cause !
that is what they seek
the prophet said that those who love god must renew their assurance of faith under the tree
we have proposed conditions for a truce between you and mecca have accepted ?
in the name of god the most merciful
who is this god ?
i do not know !
i can not accept that
muhammad the messenger of god
muhammad son of UNknown agrees with the son of abu UNknown UNknown
this is more correct !
well this is better !
we agree not to continue the journey return to their land mecca is our land !
however may make the pilgrimage next year
ten years of peace need this time use that time
for UNknown emperor of UNknown
to UNknown emperor of persia
to UNknown UNknown of alexandria
god be with you !
there is difference of races in islam
arabic is not more than one foreign a white or a black
all respond equally to god
the faith is based on the neighbor wish same as one
the man who lies down with a full stomach while his neighbor suffers hunger is not a muslim
the ink of the scholar is more important the blood of the martyr
god welcomed the man who learns to read they have done so teach those who do not know
respect the bible and the gospel because these books also come from god
because you are the prophet you should not make this work !
but he looked at me and told me
god does not love the men who creating superior to its peers then i was looking suddenly stopped approached me and said
yes i am the prophet of god but i do not know what is my future
i have come that you accept me !
without UNknown UNknown there is no god but god and that muhammad is his messenger
may god forgive me all times that i fought against you
i regret having come here with these gems delivers for the poor
let me give you my
if but you were the most bitter sword against islam
now by god 's adjourn the top is a sword in his name
with god everything is easy !
and raises the dead becomes winners to losers
two years ago we thought that the truce was a defeat and now we win more hearts
abu UNknown is coming !
why insult me this way ?
i hope some courtesy !
we do not want war we respect the truce !
i came to talk to muhammad where he is ?
muhammad we did not break the truce
i come to UNknown the position of mecca
muhammad ! give me back ?
robbers broke the truce not us was a dark night
this is your city !
UNknown you are of my own blood intercede for me to hear me !
i am the leader of mecca ! why insult me like that ?
why not save the promises not fulfilled
who would have thought ?
i won cunning in combat and UNknown
you dress like their religion grew out of nothing
i was blind i did not see the reality
tell mecca that their gods are dead no sense to resist god
go fast because here are close UNknown UNknown
we are the night before 10 000 they come from all tribes
now you can attack them back !
we will defend from home !
it is pointless thousands the number is increasing every hour coward !
you are the leader of mecca ?
look you 'r e defeated !
i swallowed and then spit you !
my father died and my brother for my husband away ?
i can see mecca even through the mountains
there are so many fires that can not be counted
when the cast of mecca no idea that it would
the smell of bread cooking yes means that are not intended to plunder the city
do not want to see blood i am sure their own homes !
we supply the city ?
may decide to kill me !
what has come to say ?
i saw their UNknown and the men around him
is the strength they have given to your men
we can no longer resist
trying again to impose conditions ?
if you cut the head would no longer have doubts
UNknown a man can take years to find their faith and another minutes
god chooses the moment !
you black slave you 'r e the best school
if the gods who worship is worth
that there is one god
do not take or steal !
be safe all they are at home in the house of abu UNknown and the UNknown
at least his words not force the door
UNknown hearts not home this is a permanent victory
i am afraid to leave
whether we 'r e wrong ?
it 's our way of life and were caught our mistakes
the gods were less than we do hours there is the entering the UNknown
in the name of allah the most merciful
god gave to abraham is home to be a sacred place and not believe in gods other than him
muhammad did not take vengeance nor let him
mecca declared a holy place
no blood or cut a tree nor kill any living being in mecca
it soon became all arabia not only the new cult but the new laws and attitudes of islam
the prophet lived to see his work done but now felt the UNknown of his death
but there is still a great act as a prophet confirmation
in the pilgrimage gave his farewell message
listen well maybe not with you much longer give the weak of their food and clothing
god called them to account for their actions those who are alert to the absent
then gabriel came to him and said
allah sends you his greetings and says
today i completed for you your faith in you and i pleased with islam as a religion
on july 8 the year 632 at 63 years old muhammad died many of the faithful could not believe it how can a man die like that ?
abu UNknown 's friend of the prophet went to the mosque and said
those who love muhammad know that he was a man and died but know that god is alive and can not die
muhammad was buried in medina the mosque but the religion that preached reached the hearts resisted was UNknown
humanity is still close to mecca
the people of islam with their clothes white pilgrims all equal before god all united in their place of prayer
it 's about time you learned respect for a real fightin dog hazel !

jesus kid do we have to hear that now ?
i UNknown l have it set up real soon
swell so then we can hear them pen pushing heroes in UNknown giving us orders eh ?
i was thinking maybe we should have arrested those men for dog fighting and that UNknown too
technically under the commonwealth UNknown if the man hazel didn 't want to sell his dog
looks like we got to build a big new jail
alvin 's going to arrest the whole town
let me give you a little advice eh kid ?
just throw those law books away
better to turn your eyes and let them fight their damn dogs
it 's a damn sight better than them killing each other
but you can 't let people get away with that making their own laws
the only thing you have to remember is UNknown 's law
you want to stay a UNknown then all you got to do is keep headquarters happy
and the only time they 'r e unhappy is when there 's a killing that 's not accounted for
so you account for all killings and you live to be an old UNknown just like me
i ain 't a sir a mister or a grandpa
now you got that ?
it UNknown l do you a lot of good
i even use it myself sometimes
you had the strength to come this far
i think you 'r e gonna make it
alvin you want a piece of this buffalo woman ?
buffalo woman 's taken a liking to alvin
probably gettin tired of old men like us
i UNknown e still got plenty of fire left in me
the least you can do to show your appreciation for a free meal is to come get it
pulled your shot eh ?
got him in the kidney
if that had been a UNknown you 'd have been UNknown
well it wasn 't a damn UNknown and i 'm not dead
UNknown don 't you ever have anything good to say about anything ?
well what do you want kid a shout a holler and a cigar for doing something halfway right for once ?
your cigars taste like shit and you 'd probably crack your face if you laughed out loud
you know if he didn 't like you he wouldn 't say nothing
no he 's just in a hurry to get back to his UNknown
he wasn 't always that way
come on let 's skin this before it freezes eh ?
no normal man lives in a little biddy hole like that
what the fuck we gonna do now ?
this is the dumbest thing i UNknown e ever done
i 'm gonna get my dog
i thought i asked you not to bring that up again
if we don 't get where it 's warm we 'r e gonna be nothin but statues out here
couldn 't fit no more than 2 in that hole
ain 't no way in hell he 's gonna let tom and i in there
you 'r e dumb !
you 'r e so dumb i could sell you dirt !
i 'm sorry i shouldn 't have said that
i am sorry okay ?
before you two kill each other there 's something i want you to do
this is the dumbest thing i UNknown e ever done
hazel 's dog ain 't chained
we don 't want no trouble mister !
we 'r e real hungry and cold !
you let us warm ourselves any spare food we pay you twice the cost for the trouble !
i 'd feel better if you 'd lay those rifles down
sorry mister but the dog wasn 't chained so
kill that goddamn dog !
kill that goddamn dog !
let 's get out of here
son of a bitch !
shot his scalp off !
that son of a bitch has killed somebody !
come on let 's go !
we had been married 9 years when my late husband left me to come here and make his fortune
after a short time what little money we had was gone but
i managed alright on my own
now all that 's left to remember him by is this broken watch and a UNknown 's license
and i thank you for holding these things for me
but i want you all to know that i 'm glad i came here
because it wasn 't until now that
you feel pretty good yourself
you UNknown e got a lot of potential for a rookie but damn you 'r e ragged
what do you mean ragged ?
look if you 'r e in a do or die contest with big stakes you let the other guy get a head start on you
take smaller UNknown and hold your breath eh ?
it looks like it 's getting to your head
when you see it 's getting to him turn that sucker up and bust it on down
then you pray to the lord you get the hell out before you fall flat on your ass
where did you learn them high school tricks ?
smooth boy you UNknown e got to think smooth
you want me to take my boots off ?
you know i used to practice on my uncle 's still
damn i 'd drink his whiskey better than anybody around
that 's a UNknown lie
i ain 't ashamed of it
not a thing mr president
no but he was a first rate pitcher with the negro league
then he tried to make the move over to the majors by saying he was a UNknown
you don 't look mexican
they didn 't want to let me in the majors and you know why
damn right i know why
i must UNknown e heard that story 600 times
because i was too damn good
hell i 'd have pitched that ball down ty cobb 's throat and made george UNknown look like a damn electric fan
alvin she wants to know when you can be ready for her
she says you 'r e a virgin
she says you walk like you UNknown e got a roll of UNknown up your ass
she says she can wait for you in the UNknown
well there 's nothing in the book that says fucking 's against the law
i mean didn 't it mean anything ?
get your hands off me !
where is he ? !
i UNknown e got to talk to him now !
that crazy son of a bitch killed jimmy tom !
the fucker who stole my dog !
and you let him be !
do you hear me edgar ? !
jimmy tom is dead !
i UNknown l take care of it
jimmy tom is dead !
i told you i would take care of it
he set right where you are boy and paid for UNknown with 100 bills
hey he just wanted some supplies
bought two of my best UNknown and 700 rounds of ammo
from the way he acted he didn 't look crazy to me at least not any more crazy than anyone else around here
you lost what brains you had
how the hell was i supposed to know who he was ?
700 rounds of ammo ?
he had a lot of money
who is this guy ?
ever hear of the mad UNknown the one who steals gold from men 's teeth ?
yes i UNknown e heard of him
you think this guy 's him ?
sure it 's him !
how else would he get all that money ?
must have made a fortune in gold
it doesn 't make sense
listen here to the high UNknown expert
tell us what makes sense
he 's the mad UNknown alright
UNknown i want to talk to you
what really happened last night ?
UNknown i have to know everything about this man we 'r e going after
i gotta know him so good i can taste him
now how did you get a rifle butt in your face without killing him ?
he shot first edgar !
don 't kill me albert
well what brings you back ?
gettin that way all over
now listen to me albert cause you ain 't got much time
things are not the same as when you left here
they put up a town about 7 years ago
just a few hours from here in good weather
there 's a UNknown outpost there and radios and newspapers come in from toronto almost regular
there 's a UNknown there named edgar UNknown and he 's coming after you
i guess he UNknown l bring a whole bunch of others with him
but he 's the last man in the world that anybody 'd want on his trail
they 'r e gonna kill you
am i gettin through to you albert ?
i appreciate you coming over here to tell me that bill
but you ain 't runnin that it ?
got no place to go
your father never had anything against running
i don 't guess anybody ever really wanted to catch up to him anyway
he 's gone isn 't he ?
he died in a prison hospital
well i guess i UNknown l head up into the high country
see you around albert !
you stick with me kid and stay low
i want a shot at the front
this is edgar UNknown of the royal canadian UNknown talking to you !
i don 't want any trouble and i don 't want to see nobody else get hurt !
i 'm coming in to talk to you !
now hear me out !
edgar what are you doing ?
if he wanted a fire fight he would have started
naw he ain 't crazy
you 'r e the one who 's crazy
you don 't look like a madman
you look like a UNknown
johnson we UNknown e got a bad situation out here
the dead body over there probably has your bullet in him
i have a pretty fair idea what happened out here
i just can 't do that
i have to take you in and clear this up
i can 't change it
to you i 'm just a name on a form you have to fill out
i have a bunch of savages out here just aching to UNknown you all over the place
they don 't want your side at all
now if you don 't come in with me that 's all the excuse they UNknown l need
they UNknown l either kill you or get themselves killed tryin
i can 't let that happen
you can 't stop it
you come in UNknown me and clear this up
i UNknown l have you back out here in 3 days
i UNknown l guarantee your safety into town and back
but if you don 't come in
you son of a bitch !
i can 't leave without bringin you in !
i hope you sons of bitches can finish what you started
we gonna wait him out ?
we 'd run out of food or freeze before he does
he 's got too much mud on the cabin to burn him out
he 's cut firing UNknown about a foot above the floor
UNknown says shoot low aim at the UNknown above the ground
he 's on the cabin floor
i 'm gonna get his scalp !
go get him charlie !
get UNknown m charlie !
let 's get out of here !
jesus i can 't see !
we got to thaw out the dynamite kid
but not in the fire
if you get popped and you drop that you know what happens
sure have a great pitcher 's hands
my mama bless her soul always said my hands were the best part of me
and your father said the best part of you ran down your mama 's leg
hope you can fuck better than you can play
i cooked up some fish for you fellas
what are you laughin at ?
i UNknown l slice your tongue out
maybe mr johnson aught to know about them pretty little teeth you got
well i UNknown l be damned
hell of a way for a man to die being blown up
yeah be a good man to have on your side
too bad we got to kill the son of a bitch
johnson would have given himself up if he hadn 't been guilty of something
guess i was wrong about him
most would have run if they had the chance
what 's our job in this edgar ?
surround the cabin and stay out of my way
son of a bitch !
son of a bitch !
he UNknown l be heading north up to the snow in the kruger pass
we UNknown l need your dogs hazel
and enough supplies to stay out a couple of weeks
bring ned and the bodies back to town
can 't be no normal man
no he 's a killer
maybe it was his ghost or something
would it make any difference if i wait ?
if i left now i 'd never know what it would have been like with you
i guess it 's up to me isn 't it ?
it 's been a long time now
ain 't it about time to rest ? !
we got to push until we drop
get away from my dog !
well then keep him the hell away from me
cut that out damn it !
the UNknown are deeper in back
what 's that mean ?
he 's got his UNknown on backwards
he 's laying 2 sets of tracks for us
he ain 't runnin yet
what do you mean he ain 't runnin ?
you see anything edgar ?
that 's a girl 's name isn 't it ?
the way i hear it told hazel 's mama didn 't know if he was a boy or girl 't ill he was about 15
everyone up here is vicious
ain 't that right edgar ?
you 'r e real civilized
we don 't get many pretty young white boys like you up here
only one thing you 'r e good for
son of a bitch !
look who just got uncivilized
hold it doesn 't stand a chance
i 'm UNknown a 500 reward for his capture !
my newspaper will match that offer dollar for dollar !
that 's 1 000 on the head of albert johnson !
let 's go get him !
i hope that bastard stays alive forever eh ?
it UNknown l be bringing in supplies for us !
where 's sergeant UNknown ?
you 'r e looking at him
i 'm captain hank tucker UNknown
i UNknown e come to bring the fugitive to justice !
as you can see he was one of the americans best trained men
special intelligence squad in the war
these pictures were taken for security
he ain 't no rookie
i don 't have to remind you this is confidential information
who the hell we going to tell it to ?
volunteers will be arriving in a couple of days
i said send them back
we don 't need anymore UNknown up here
they UNknown l be up here anyway
there 's a 1000 bounty on johnson
now that 's more like it
how could you let a thing like that happen ?
we can use that manpower
to assist me in cutting him off before he gets in to that river chain
you really don 't know what 's going on do you ?
he 's not headed into the river chain
he 's going to UNknown his way up the sunshine pass to alaska
no one 's going to make it through sunshine pass this time of year
well this one 's going to try
if he gets over that range he 's free
and neither you nor your plane can do anything about that
we UNknown e been hunting a man who knows how to live off the land and use the terrain
he doesn 't have to feed a large posse
captain have you ever flown the bush in winter ?
my credentials are impeccable sergeant
they sent for me because i am the best !
now your superiors know what this is one big goddamn UNknown !
you UNknown e had your chance and your ground maneuvers have been an UNknown failure
it UNknown l look good for the air corps if one of your fly boys does what the men on the ground couldn 't eh ?
this is a new era
well if you 'r e part of the future
i don 't want to see it
clarence if i get to johnson first i UNknown l give you half the reward
you get to him first you give me half the reward
it 's only me bill loose
i thought you was the mad UNknown for sure
how about a drop for the preacher ?
so you want to help us hunt johnson ?
i prefer to work alone you know ?
we 'r e the only ones left who knows what this guy looks like
sure except UNknown hazel UNknown and and me
there 's a lot of gold in them teeth clarence
gold at 35 an ounce
i UNknown e seen it happen before
if anybody 's gonna bring albert johnson in it 's gonna be me
not some bounty hunter or fly boy UNknown for promotion
why are you so special ?
that 's johnson ahead of us
he 's runnin with the UNknown trying to throw us off
his UNknown are gettin shorter
means he 's gettin tired
alright we got him !
i could have had him !
you 'r e in a hell of a hurry to kill !
he 's on the ridge !
i UNknown l miss you
we UNknown e got to bury him
don 't ever grab me
if we don 't bury him the dogs will eat him
kill the dogs i got a man to hunt
you got to make up your mind if you 'r e a priest or a UNknown
i UNknown l shoot any man that tries to follow us !
you UNknown e seen what 's happened up here !
he UNknown l do the same to you !
you still think you can bring albert johnson in alive ?
the pure fact is he 's runnin to save his hide
and every man he killed he killed to protect himself
well what about hawkins and UNknown ?
what did any of them die for UNknown ?
johnson didn 't do anything i wouldn 't do if i was in his boots
and if i thought the killing would stop here i 'd let him go
my old man warned me never to trust you
he didn 't move like johnson
better check it out but be careful
his face is blown off !
just my eyes playing tricks on me
maybe i am too old eh ?
well what about johnson ?
as far as i 'm concerned that 's albert johnson
now you 'r e in charge
it 's up to you when the killing stops
johnson 's got a whole bag of gold UNknown here
he 's the goddamn mad UNknown !
edgar UNknown killed albert johnson
my grandmother sang that song to me
i especially like the part that goes
i once was lost but now i 'm found
you must be a fool to roll up in here man
but i figure you must be lost
so i tell you what
this is for your bill
and since you look like such a UNknown individual here 's the tip
find your ass out of here
we haven 't finished our drinks
this is a UNknown we don 't need
and don 't come back UNknown
guess you want to gamble with your life
casino 's as good a place as any
guess i could use a little exercise
guns don 't kill people
for example these two guys with the machine guns
lf they start blasting off ain 't none of y 'a ll going home !
you guys are disturbing my business
so if your ass ain 't black you 'd better get up out of here before it really get hot !

besides you drive like shit
how are those UNknown coming along ?
i just have three more deeds to get signed over
you don 't play around with the UNknown
they UNknown e owned them stores for over 30 years
so what if they need a couple more days to UNknown over their decision ?
these are tense times right now
you 'r e murdering yourself
golf is a game of UNknown not power
ln that way it 's much like the rest of life
the key is letting the body work together
get a good shoulder turn so the wrist breaks naturally
make sure you keep your eyes on the ball
this shaft i don 't like it
it ain 't working for me
with all respect to the shop owners without the deeds there 's no deal

what the hell are you doing here ?
i need to ask you
you 'r e the only guy i know working down the criminal ladder
this is the last number my brother called before he was murdered
but i don 't know your brother

he 's headed around the front !
sun UNknown was lost to us by assassination less than a month ago
a grocery store was UNknown and his wife killed
with all respect ch UNknown any of us could be killed at any time UNknown or not
we are not the blacks victor
our loyalty to each other is UNknown
at least let us strike harder
we will only do that when it serves us best
let kai worry about this
han i don 't want to lose another son
he didn 't think you 'd make it
it 's been a long time han
tell me what happened that night ?
he got in a fight in a black club
they got po that night before i could find him
he wouldn 't tell me
your brother was a loose cannon but he didn 't deserve this
why fight with blacks ?
well the waterfront 's only four square miles
half the businesses belong to us the other half to them
it was just a matter of time
i was afraid prison would make you soft
could you find something better to do than creep up on me ?
and besides aren 't you in the wrong part of town ?
at your store they said you were here
i wanted the yellow one
i want the yellow one
well you get a green one
did you talk to your brother ?
what made you think that ?
he works for my dad
he 's got a bad attitude
who 's your friend ?
i didn 't catch your name
what 's your name ?
my friends call me UNknown
same chump took mo 's ride after he beat us down
nobody ever kicked my ass
what are you talking about ?
we can 't start because we 'r e a man short
i don 't know this game
man it 's easier than breathing
fellas got myself a fresh recruit
he 's a rookie so take it easy on him
the brothers and i always give UNknown warm welcomes
so don 't worry about a thing
i just need you to stand behind me
i UNknown l give you the ball and you run to the far end of the field
let 's see your special
like i told your ass before
you ain 't the only one that knows some shit
it 's a contact sport
this time run a little bit and turn up the middle
and i UNknown l throw the ball to you
mo you my negro mo
how come nobody else gets hit ?
i 'd like hut three
pop ain 't feeling me
he still wants me to ride around with training wheels and shit
i was like pops gotta understand that me and him is cut from like the same cloth
he needs to start respecting me as a man
i mean he needs to start respecting my manhood
shit i went to college
like that phone call i got the other day
pop 's too afraid about me handling the business and stuff
but baby i got ideas
i mean you know i got ideas
shit i am an idea
i 'm about to have an einstein moment
it 's gonna be scary
hey look all i want to know is when does colin o 'd ay get to run with the show ?
sorry mr o 'd ay
you had something to do with this
what you want me to say ?
what do you want ?
you 'r e as responsible as the people who did this to my brother
don 't come near me
you might as well have thrown him out that window yourself
we 'r e at the crossroads now UNknown
i won 't pretend i know what you 'r e feeling
but i know you gotta keep it UNknown up until business is done
the people who did this l promise you on my life they UNknown l be knocked out of the box in due time
i UNknown l make sure of it
once colin and i did something we thought would really be funny
he hid out front while i ran to tell my mom he 'd been hurt
hit by a car or something really bad like that
when she came he was supposed to jump out
you know surprise her and we 'd all fall out and have this great laugh
me and my mom always loved a good laugh
i was about or 9
colin was like 1 1
i don 't remember how we came up with it but sure enough i start screaming and yelling
and my mom runs out of the house
she 's like UNknown what 's wrong ?
when i told her i mean
the look on her face
even when colin popped up to show it was a joke she couldn 't stop crying
she just held him close
UNknown him you know ?
i was just a baby
and no matter how hard i cry he 's not gonna pop up and show me it was just a joke
i gotta put this thing together just as much as you do now
gentlemen we are ready to approach the UNknown
i don 't think any of the other bids are even in contention
we UNknown e got the money the organization waterfront real estate seconds from the bridge
god himself couldn 't have designed a better spot for a stadium
lf i say there 's caviar on the mountain you bring the crackers
i don 't get it
po didn 't want them found
it says 44 UNknown road
i can 't hit a girl
them little things pay the rent you know what i mean ?

now he wants to be a club owner
he 's working on something big
i don 't care how big it is
your pops can sweat me and mac can sweat me all they want
but silk is staying right here
i think we all should stay right here for one more UNknown
it 's like that partner ?
you 'r e gonna try to roll up in here on me ?
you might as well lose the gat
it 's like i told your punk ass before l ain 't signing shit

i hope you land on your feet grasshopper
you 'r e not the only one knows some shit
everything 's kosher down to the last UNknown
you 'r e a good man
you once gave me your condolences
i now offer mine in regards to your son
so this has been what it 's all about huh ?
i wish my boy could see me do this
go ahead and keep that
you just acquired another partner
i think it 's time the UNknown had a black owner
you 'r e joking right ?
you 'r e not joking
i 'm afraid i already have a partner
well you just got another one in fact
don 't forget mr roth without these deeds you have no
do you mind if i have a moment ?
so this is the plan ?
you want to be partners with roth
i UNknown e been waiting for the right time to tell you
i 'm going to the owner 's box
we are going to the owner 's box
i ain 't playing with these people
i UNknown e had enough of this legit shit
UNknown o 'd ay development 's getting straight UNknown by UNknown UNknown
i 'm taking your most valued asset
ls she worth 3 million to you ?
now i know you 'r e crazy
you lost your mind thinking whites would let you own a piece of their game
me and ch UNknown had an understanding
anybody who didn 't sign those deeds we took care of
what do you mean ?
i was there when he killed silk
so now after everything you really gonna try to do this ?
i have been covering your ass for years UNknown
quite frankly i am just tired of being your boy
just because you put your kids through college that 's supposed to make all of your crooked straight ?
man you want to own a damn box
mac just want to own the streets
that 's always been your problem
even fake wars have casualties UNknown
take it down now !
why did you kill my brother ?
all that chinese shit happened in house
you have your own people to thank for that
not that you UNknown l get the chance
sorry romeo but you gotta die
damn that 's some cold shit
we UNknown e called the police
i 'm all right baby
you doing all right ?
i 'm doing all right
you 'r e the one who 's been making all this trouble huh ?
let me shake your hand
you got a firm grip
he just a little guy
i don 't know what to do with you
your brother wasn 't suited to lead
he didn 't have the discipline
that 's why you killed him
that 's why i had to
give me some skin !
come on let 's go
we got a burn notice on you
should we shoot them ?
what are you doing here ?
just giving you a little taste of what i woke up to this morning bro
you mind if i come in ?
you know if these visits become a habit
i 'm gonna start thinking you like me
oh you remember my partner detective lopez
i 'm not sure you two formally met
i 'm glad you 'r e here
i got a gift for you
we were just dropping nate off
just a way to say thank you for chatting to us about his big brother
and i thought it wouldn 't hurt to see if you were free today to answer some questions
i need to finish my UNknown
then i was planning on working out
well until your calendar clears up just know i 'm gonna make my way through every friend relative and associate you have
let me save you some time
my friends and family don 't know anything
sooner or later someone will
when you want this to stop
how long you been in town ?
about six hours five of which were spent
listening to your girlfriend over there tell me that i 'd fled to vegas to avoid some UNknown parking tickets
i figured that out after she said it would go easier if i flipped on my brother
jesus bro i didn 't say anything all right ?
but do you know how hard it is not to talk about your UNknown activities ? all right
drive me to mom 's
i came back to talk with investors about UNknown my company
things are finally breaking my way
so nate didn 't give her anything ?
if there 's one thing nate UNknown knows how to do it 's avoid telling the truth
well that 's good news for now
but how long before UNknown finds someone you know that she can flip like a gun runner named seymour ?
or a money UNknown named barry ?
or a washed up navy seal named sam ?
if UNknown 's going after everyone i know then i need to get to know someone she UNknown l regret going after
make it look like you 'r e mixed up with someone with a little bit of clout maybe somebody from the mayor 's office
that 's my way of saying thank you for the last time i saw you
well nice to see you too
you 'r e nate 's UNknown
nate 's with him now
doesn 't nate look happy ?
of course he doesn 't realize that his UNknown is actually an UNknown from sicily called the butcher
brought him over special just for this
oh oh oh michael no
it 's not up to me
whether nate 's meeting ends in a bullet or a handshake is entirely up to you
see you 'r e gonna be running some errands for me today
just think of me as uh
UNknown keys wallet and your sunglasses
i want to see those pretty eyes
you 'r e certainly in a hurry
is this little job of yours time sensitive ?
UNknown for intel from the get go
you are a sly one aren 't you ?
you know you could save me some time
you 'r e just a key michael
keys don 't need to know what 's behind the doors they unlock
now rules for the UNknown
i give orders you obey
you try to escape nate dies
fail to complete a task nate dies
but i 'm not playing fetch until i know nate 's ok
no that could have been taken hours ago
prove nate 's alive now or your project ends here
you 'r e the one stopping me
not right away of course
my partner is a man who really enjoys his work yeah it 's me
hey you heading over ?
uh i UNknown e got a few errands to run but you can work out the broad strokes with my partner
be careful though buddy he can be ruthless once he starts to work you over
now get in the damn car
so this is the house and now you 'r e living here
i 'm just crashing here for a while ok ?
i 'm just helping out with some home repairs
it 's not like that
you got here fast barry
my salon 's in the neighborhood so
anyway so michael 's got a cop problem ?
yeah it 's making life unpleasant for all of us
well tiny issue all right ?
my life coach has strongly suggested that i try and avoid UNknown situations
barry we 'r e not asking you to storm the station
just open a joint bank account with mike
and a mayor 's aide great
why don 't we just throw a judge in there while we 'r e at it ?
barry we called you because this cop isn 't just our problem
she 's UNknown everybody in mike 's life
you really want to find out what questions she has for his dear old money UNknown pal barry ?
here 's what you 'r e gonna do
once your pretty little hands swipe that card my pretty little hands are gonna do some financial magic
yeah uh say barry before you and your hands get too busy
i thought maybe you could help me out with a little home improvement project
so who 's the guy with the purse ?
what does he do ?
he 's sam 's financial consultant
now you got to hold it up
i got to put this thing up
you see that building ?
there 's a hardware key in a desk in office 237
in about a half an hour it 's gonna be in my pocket
this gets you past security
besides the guards there should be nobody in the building on a sunday
i hope you know more about the building than my jacket size
UNknown you got bigger things to worry about than how pretty you look in your coat
the offices are wired to the building 's alarms
how long do i have inside ?
if you 'r e not going to tell me what we 'r e doing here
UNknown just eat what 's on your plate
while you 'r e in there phone a friend write an e mail UNknown your facebook status i honestly don 't care
as long as you remember what really matters here
i don 't get what i want and your brother dies
madeline what was that ? !
oh nothing just part of the process
what did you break it ?
no no no it 's fine
yeah i don 't have a lot of time
liked to strap bombs to kids
yeah he 's back and he 's threatening to kill nate unless i steal something for him some kind of high tech equipment
uh hey why don 't you show UNknown our progress and i UNknown l be right back ?
nate was 35 minutes ago
that 's all i know
what can i do ?
i just hacked UNknown 's cell
i e mailed you everything on it
i need you to comb through the addresses text messages and phone calls
you want to know what UNknown 's after ?
i want to know everything
i want to know who his buyer is where he 's got nate what brand of orange juice he drinks in the morning
and you better hurry cause i get the feeling
what the hell did you do ? oh i i i was moving the rack and it fell into the window
the UNknown blade fell and i went to get it and i hit it and it fell
are you trying to pull something ? no
come on man i the blade came off and it fell rick kill the alarm did you go into that office ?
no i only do the UNknown so i
what the hell is this ?
i was picking up glass and i cut myself
and i do the windows
and i 'm gonna get a vacuum and i 'm gonna clean this up
johnny no hey hey hey you 'r e gonna stay right here
whenever there 's an alarm we have to call the police
you don 't have to do that
no listen you don 't have to do that !
it 's simple glass !
are you drunk ? no
don 't lie to me
i can smell it on you
just hold on please ?
this job is all i got and if i miss a child support payment my ex is gonna take the kids to UNknown with her boyfriend
but i UNknown l make it right if you just let this one slide
what 's that tell you about me ?
that i feel the need to appear powerful and UNknown ?
i see you 'r e still a sharp dresser
now what is that gonna tell you about me ?
it 's already pretty well established that i like nice things
and enough with the digging
here 's how this is gonna work
the guy in that house has a voice
you have a voice recorder
you 'r e gonna put the two together
you want to be a little more specific ?
do you want his favorite bible verses UNknown rap ?
full name and every number zero through nine
someone 's making a voice key
thanks for making it easy on me
actually i understand he 's a bit of a gun nut which means he 's less likely to call the cops and more likely to just shoot you
so good luck with that
oh man i am so sorry
this cat ran right in front of me
i left my wallet in my jacket at home and the insurance card is in my wallet
are you trying to get out of this ?
i UNknown l just call my insurance company and they UNknown l totally have all of my my info
and i left my UNknown in my jacket
can i use you can use mine
do you have pen and paper ?
what 's this one here a 357 ?
you make this one ?
what about this little tiny one ?
yeah but what kind of bullets does it use ?
well you 'r e an engineer of guns ?
i was at the u of m
i graduated 1 9 UNknown
what does it matter ?
what 's that mr carpenter ?
it 's carver and it 's three oh five
you mean three zero five ?
yes three zero five !
ok so what 's that ?
what 's UNknown got you doing ?
and now i 'm hanging out with a gun designer named jonathan carver collecting numbers for a voice key
sounds like UNknown 's after some government UNknown weapon
how are we doing on the information from UNknown 's phone ?
i mean it 's less than a week old
i mean this weasel 's pretty careful
there 's no contacts list either
so there i think we got a little bit of good news
UNknown placed a bunch of calls to UNknown bank and trust
he used his phone to enter his pin
barry 's working on it
look for any rent or mortgage payments
if UNknown 's got a place in miami there 's a good bet nate 's there
what are you trying to pull ?
how was your meal ?
let me take this for you
i know you 'r e not our waitress but my friend 's in a hurry
can i give it to you ?
i got the UNknown card info from
how soon can you meet me at 115 island ?
i UNknown l be there in 10
look i don 't know who you are
i don 't know what you think you 'r e doing
i want 2 grand in cash and your car stays right here until i get it
look at your car !
that car is eight inches from the curb and it 's supposed to only be six inches from the curb !
what are you talking about ?
look at your car !
it is supposed to only be six inches from the curb !
say it 's eight inches from the curb !
get off me man !
i 'm gonna get off of you when you admit it !
i UNknown l let you go if you say it
your car is eight inches from the curb
all right all right all right !
you 'r e forcing me to break into a weapons manufacturer forcing
no you 'r e right let 's go with forcing anyway there 's a box in r d lab 422
what 's in the box ?
for our purposes it couldn 't matter less
if you want me to go in there it couldn 't matter more
anything could be in that box
i 'm not handing over a UNknown to save one life even if it is my brother 's
look you want me to fetch you UNknown l tell me what 's in the box and where it 's headed
i 'm pretty sure i can get you to go get it without telling you a damn thing yeah what 's up ?
how 's it going ?
listen i had a question for you
are you one of those people who agrees to see a job through and then UNknown ?
it 's just i hate working with people like that
it 's just one of those things you know ?
it makes me want to kill someone
because i take my UNknown very seriously and i like working with people who do the same
so what do you want me to do ?
we 'r e deciding whether little brother lives through the phone call
i love my brother UNknown
don 't flatter yourself UNknown
it 's not a UNknown
it 's a UNknown lock for advanced infantry weapons
people will go on killing each other in little wars all around the globe whether or not you steal it
what am i looking at in there ?
a two man security team
unfortunately you can 't go around them
you UNknown e got to go through them
looks like i 'm gonna need that tire iron again
can i help you ?
yeah i work on the third floor and i 'm trying to get to my car in the garage but the power is out
one of the guards went into the electrical room but it 's been a while and it 's still dark down here
barry has run out of addresses to check
we probably just missed him
this beer is still cold
sam where are you ?
we 'r e at UNknown 's
did you find nate ?
nate was here but he 's gone now
we 'r e out of time sam
look this is not over
i UNknown l call barry again
we UNknown l check for any addresses we might have missed
doing deals over the phone is so impersonal
seriously it 's not a problem
you know i feel the same way
if we 'r e gonna be business partners we got to get to know each other
you know what i mean ?
we got to be um
is that what you were thinking ? what 's he doing here ?
you see it 's always at the end when everything 's coming together that people start making desperate moves
i used one of those UNknown UNknown rounds
a lot of soft tissue damage but it doesn 't usually kill
you didn 't need to do that
it 's called a UNknown
you just had to know what was in the box so i just had to show you who was in charge
now assuming you can read a map just follow that red line right to my new beach house
hardware key gets you into the r d area
carver 's voice recognition gets you into the lab
i cut it together while you were playing with the guards
he needs to get to a hospital
oh and UNknown don 't dawdle
UNknown brought nate here and shot him
no he 's hurt bad
it was just UNknown 's version of a pep talk
sam if we don 't find something to use against UNknown
i 'm gonna have to give him what he wants
you give UNknown what he wants chances are he UNknown l kill you both
i 'm running out of options sam
you know most of UNknown 's bank records point to some north african buyer so you know unless you 'r e planning a trip to cairo
a few UNknown haven 't been touched in years
this UNknown international some s UNknown looks like a tax shelter
tell me about UNknown international
well it 's more like a russian UNknown doll than a company
you know i dug through nine UNknown in six countries
all i got was belle anna holding out of UNknown
he sends UNknown every 6 months it looks like
a lot of work to hide 80 grand a year
there 's no business records either for belle anna
that 's all there is
mike you still there ?
he had a tie clip
didn 't want to talk about his family
i think i might know what it is
you think or you know ?
does fi have any c 4 ?
well it 's fi mike
you got to ask ?
can you walk barry through UNknown a call in 10 minutes ?
that 's gonna be tight but yeah sure
sounds like you UNknown e got something good mike
this is just outside of my comfort zone ok ?
i 'm just saying i 'm not that great with british UNknown !
there 's no other way barry
it UNknown l all be fine
how big do we want this ?
well enough to make a point
tell me this is a joke
was i UNknown about the situation here ?
no you were very clear
i told you not to kill the neighbors !
you told me to make a point
oh god please don 't
i i 'm through playing games UNknown
i think you got a text message
what the hell is this ?
it 's your house i believe
if that 's all you UNknown e got
oh that 's not all
since we last met i became an expert on tyler UNknown
that is a desperate bluff a for effort but
i probably wouldn 't believe me either
UNknown bank and trust has some fine security
are you currently banking with us ?
yes i need to check my balance
yes at 11 00 a m
local time 261 000 was transferred out of this account
your current balance is 4
i am so good in fact that i can put it all back right now if you let us go
but you and your brother are finished
what about belle anna ?
the one who gave you that UNknown tie pin the one you 'r e sending to private school in switzerland for 40 000 a semester
why are you calling so late ?
honey i i 'm sorry
i forgot what time it was
you you go back to sleep ok pumpkin ?
i UNknown l call you tomorrow
this isn 't you UNknown
you 'r e capable of a lot but you wouldn 't hurt a child
why go through all this ?
took some time to get an assassin into place halfway around the world
if you go near her if you touch her if
if she so much as skins her knee on the playground
i swear to god UNknown
i will spend the rest of my life destroying you and everything you love
of course you will UNknown
you UNknown l hear from me again michael
how 's the arm ?
it 's a little bit sore
what 'd you tell mom ?
i told her i was attacked by a UNknown
i didn 't want her to get scared
you thinking about sticking around for a while ?
feels a little weird being back now
you know i really thought i had something this time
nate i know it 's hard sometimes being my brother
i didn 't hear you come in
i 'd rather you not lie right to my face
i 'm just glad both of my boys are home
and that i got to know barry
he 's coming over later with some new UNknown UNknown hair UNknown
we 'r e gonna have a product party
you know i 'm starting to think
i screw up his life better than he does
oh don 't be so hard on yourself
he wouldn 't be breathing if it weren 't for you
may i have a word ?
is your friend coming ?
oh detective lopez ? no
ooh has he been naughty ?
he 's been doing his job actually
he grilled a mayor 's aide for three hours about some mysterious bank account she opened with a michael UNknown
turned out to be a bank error but not before the mayor got upset enough to have his badge yanked
i assume you were trying to get to me
you UNknown l be glad to know
i didn 't come by to ask you questions this time
i came by to say this
you want to play rough i can give as good as i get

we heard he tried to contact you yeah yeah yeah
the guy breaks out of prison f b i knows about it and nobody tells me ?
we understand that you 'r e upset danny it was none of your business

that is if you want your girl back
engine two let 's move out
danny you catching a ride ?
we 'r e your best chance danny
tell us what we wanna know we UNknown l tell you what you wanna know
there was a prison break in florida two weeks ago
miles and the inmates took the guards killed the warden and demanded 30 cars to drive out of the prison
and you gave them to them ?
wasn 't exactly our choice danny
the bureau gave them cars with kill switches and remote door locks
the inmates get three blocks away from the yard national guard comes in puts everyone back in their cells
would you please just shut up ?
you 'r e killing me with the whining
you have no idea what you 'r e up against do you ?
i know you arrested him but you still don 't know
the fact miles jackson has your girlfriend mmm that interests me very little
the fact that he 's done something that he never does the fact that he 's shown himself in the city that interests me quite a bit more
you wanna catch miles ?
i wanna keep molly alive and i know what i gotta do
just stay the hell out of my way
i guess he didn 't hear me about the whining
sir this is exactly what miles wants
what are you best friends now ?
if danny keeps playing the game miles is distracted
miles is distracted he might make a mistake and i UNknown l bury him
let 's head up the south UNknown
let 's get a line up there
the guys are going up the UNknown now !
thirty two minutes ago molly porter was taken from the canal street ferry
we need every security camera every possible witness every vehicle plate number
this asshole calls again i wanna know where he is
i wanna know what he 's doing
i wanna find him before he so much as thinks about touching one hair on her head
this could be your girlfriend could be your wife
sometimes victory is not all it 's cracked up to be
two pounds of explosives packed inside one of these boxes
you now have less than seven minutes to cross the 23 city blocks between here and the UNknown street wharf
arrive at the wharf any later the bomb goes off
the other box contains the clue to the next round
and don 't forget to wear the hat and use the siren
we won 't even be out of the building in seven minutes

the bell signals the start of the next round
oh you 'r e finally starting to get the hang of this
i wanna speak to molly

how about i show her to you ?
as i said the clue to the next round is in the box you so UNknown hung on to
you put two and two together you might have quite the reunion
tell me you didn 't kill anybody with that thing
let 's drain this thing and get it back to the yard
thought you guys were gonna catch him
we switched out your UNknown card
we 'r e tapped into your phone
we can track you wherever you go
miles will call again danny
when he does keep him on the line for 30 seconds
that 's all we need
miles 's phone 's UNknown
you can 't trace it
we 'r e the f b i not UNknown p d
all we need is 30 seconds
all teams listen up listen up !
it 's the hotel UNknown
get the elevators shut down
blue team seal all the exits
i need snipers on the roof
shut down all communication in and out of the building and start with the dogs
i need to know what room this key is for
come on come on come on
what time was this ?
it was like 30 minutes ago
what 's it say ?
we 'r e still here
we just found miles on camera
he 's uh he 's talking to somebody
they 'r e leading him somewhere
i 'm gonna go find willie
so miles rented the s u v
last week in lafayette left a dummy address
we 'r e tracking the i d on the security deposit boxes and known accomplices but so far nothing
what are we missing ?
this guy doesn 't plan everything and not leave a trail
miles and the boys take the yard
but miles is the only one who escapes
but the f b i already talked to UNknown m all
get me the warden on the phone
he gave miles the access code to the security elevator
it goes all the way to the basement
i UNknown l meet you there
hey sorry if i did something wrong before
this guy he had all the right papers
said he was here to service the air conditioning
this thing still works ?
i led him this far
they vent out to the roof
sir we 'r e clear
there 's no sign of miles
what 's this for ?
if you 'r e UNknown this round 6 has already started
just the wrong place at the wrong time
at the conclusion of this message you UNknown l have 60 seconds
before the elevator free falls to the ground
with 60 seconds limited resources
and willie 's unfortunate UNknown
there 's only time for one of you to survive
who lives and who dies that is your decision
for the lucky the clue to round 7 is framed in the lobby
for the other at least you UNknown l be a lot thinner
danny he made me read this to you
is that for real man ?
i got a wife and kids
where 's the security hatch ?
how do i open this thing ?
i UNknown l get you out
shit i can 't fit through there
all right big man let 's go
it 's your only hope
less than 40 seconds !
that means we need to work together
don 't let go !
don 't let go !
don 't let go !
willie the elevator 's gonna fall
you gotta get on the ledge
i need you on the ledge
you can make it !
all teams commence evacuation of three city block radius
high pressure gas leak in hotel
i UNknown e got a wife and kids
miles didn 't give you enough time
i did everything you asked miles
you had no reason to kill him
you had the choice to save him
are you givin up on me ?
cause if you wanna stop playin
the clue to the next round molly said nothing !
i just watched a man die and i don 't even know if molly 's still alive
i need a minute to figure this out
there 's nothin to figure danny
is the f b i tryin to trace this call ?
first it was your friends in the police department who realized the cell was UNknown
then it was the f b i
george UNknown and all his wonderful little toys ?
so why don 't we start over again see if it 's that much fun the second time around
you try and trace my call again i am gonna start cutting molly 's toes off
so how about i call you again in two minutes ?
before today the feds have been up on miles 's cell phone a grand total of one time
it 's working just fine
if danny keeps doing this a lot more people are gonna get hurt
don 't answer the phone
what the hell you think you 'r e doin ?
listen to me for a second all right danny ?
willie can be the last person who has to die today
we UNknown l find molly
it 's claiborne and UNknown
i 'm playing the game miles
that 's all that counts right ?
how very true but it 's time to see you play for yourself for a change
be at the location in the photo in 10 minutes
you come alone and you UNknown l have a 50 50 chance of having the time of your life
we 'r e more than halfway through danny
don 't be a hero ray
it 's not in your pay grade
danny we got two teams three blocks out
i don 't see anything
he said 10 minutes danny
just stay in your position
i don 't know if he 's gonna go pro
danny get ready to be happy
i got a pissed off member of the black liberation army is what i got
miles had him kill a couple guards during the prison break and then left the brother behind to take the fall
when can you get him to talk ?
soon as i get the judge to sign the warrant
i 'm gonna need it in two
you got a 50 50 chance
you two lovebirds care for a sit ?
was he just talking to someone ?
miles is on the bus
all teams we have a confirmation
miles jackson is on the bus
why don 't we just take him out now ?
we stop that bus now he turns this into a UNknown
we know where he is
we 'r e takin our shot
can 't have you runnin off now can i ?
first of all a small charge explodes and fires a three inch nail into molly 's heart
i 'm aiming for the right atrium but we UNknown l see what happens
what can i say danny ?
i just like to play the game
i didn 't mean for erica to die
i don 't think that matters
that 's the one i want
set up on the 10 UNknown
swat team this is agent santiago
oh you should see the look on your faces
it 's between you and me
well i 'm afraid if i let molly go danny you won 't play the game
you 'r e thinkin can i get to the phone on time ?
why did miles ask to meet me here ?
is there somethin funny ?
he 's gonna win and then he 's gonna kill you
jason you 'r e scout
sniper team 1 t r t team in place
what if i think that vest is for show ?
pick everybody up in pieces ?
miles that bomb blows you die too
but i know you won 't
cause you 'r e UNknown danny
all teams hold on my mark
sir that 's a 75 yard shot through a moving bus window
one sniper 's gotta break the glass another one 's gotta get the hit
you sure this is how you wanna do this ?
team delta prepare for visual
teams bravo and charlie hold for extract once shots are fired
we have confirmed subject but no clear shot
female hostage is in and out of the target line
you have the green light
you know you 'r e gonna kill that girl
i 'm gonna kill miles
what the hell happened ?
and get me a 20 on miles
ready to do this ?
you could UNknown e killed her !
you knew she was there and you took the shot !
listen to me you little shit !
you shoot miles everybody on that bus is dead !
you didn 't know that did you you prick !
she had a bomb on her chest
you shoot miles everybody dies
i had her in my arms man
i told her i was gonna save her and i let her go
there was nothing you could do bro
she 's not gonna die danny
you gotta stop blaming yourself
because miles is punishing molly for something i did
danny you were doing your job
i don 't care !
i was three feet i was three feet away
most importantly you bought us some time
and now i got a name
he said miles played chess every day in the prison yard with a guy named anthony UNknown
UNknown got paroled three weeks before the prison break and he 's in town
jansen 's on his way to get the address from his p o right now
what the hell you doin here ?
i knew my boy needed me
we 'r e finally gettin ahead of this son of a bitch
i told you i wasn 't gonna let you down
you know you can 't do this alone
i 'm not gonna ask you to stop
i 'm just gonna ask you to let me help you
there 's five numbers inside this envelope
choose wisely and the number you dial will win the round without further action
choose poorly and the number you dial will arm one of four devices scattered throughout the city
you now have 60 seconds
they 'r e devices not locations
that doesn 't make any sense
they 'r e text messages
second one is the convention center
danny we got less than 10 seconds
we got three numbers left
and now round 9 is gonna be so much fun
very shortly streetcar 907 will enter the downtown area on canal street
you UNknown e just UNknown the brakes and the communication radio
your task is simply stop the streetcar before it UNknown through the end of the line and everything else in its path
this is special agent ray santiago of the f b i
streetcar 907 has lost its brakes and is speeding toward the UNknown
no this is not a prank phone call
my name is special agent ray santiago of the f b i
i need to talk to somebody that can help brakes squealing
they 'r e playing barry UNknown
we 'r e on our way to intercept right now
is there anyone there that can help us make this decision ?
you shut down the power the streetcar comes to a stop
miss one more time for the cheap seats
you guys in position ?
all clear along the perimeter
ring the bell and get a prize !
does anyone hear me ?
how fast you think that thing 's goin ?
target is heading out the back door
suspect is on the move
let 's see where he 's going
phelps and i will follow him
aren 't we going too fast ?
keep it straight and keep your foot on the brake
it 's out of control
i UNknown e tried the brake
all units suspect is entering the dixie UNknown factory on UNknown
we take out the power
you are outta your damn mind
you ever jump out of a moving car before ?
it 's still goin too fast !
get outta the way !
i 'm gettin the truck now
that 's a great idea
this is gettin a little too easy miles
what are you gettin soft on me ?
how about you give me something that 's gonna be a challenge ?
if round 10 is your best friend takin anthony UNknown then round 11 is me taking your best friend
the person you are calling is not
it 's going to voice mail
i don 't have anything man
i got somebody on the phone
i 'm trying to get you a straight answer
how can you not get a straight answer ?
he was at the warehouse
i hear what you 'r e sayin
there was an explosion at the factory
there are UNknown on the scene now but hank was inside
there 's no way he could UNknown e made it
okay look three years ago
miles stole three UNknown from a u s military shipment in iraq
we tracked him to pakistan
but the day the deal went down
i lost miles and i lost the guns
two days later one of those UNknown shot down a UNknown out of UNknown
this was the only thing i could find intact in the rubble
what i 'm saying is i made a mistake here
i forgot why i carry this
this isn 't about miles
this is about the people he 's hurt and the ones he 's gonna hurt
guys i 'm never gonna see her again
we got one round left
and i know miles better than any person alive
oh danny boy ?? ? ??
the pipes the pipes are calling ???
sorry about the delay danny
but i think that we 'r e just about ready for our grand finale
it is round 12 and this time we won 't be goin to the judges UNknown
in 17 minutes it will be exactly one year since erica 's death and i have to ask will molly suffer a similar fate ?
you UNknown e done well to survive this long
now all you have to do is find her
she has a touch phone strapped to her chest along with some other more explosive items
except this time only your UNknown only your touch can stop the timer
tell me where she is
are you sorry for what you UNknown e done ?
yes miles i 'm sorry
then perhaps maybe you should pay her a visit tell her so yourself
it 's been fun danny but game over
pay erica a visit ?
where is she buried ?
where is she buried ?
that 's with a c
this is ray santiago of the f b i
i need a police escort
tell whoever gets there don 't touch anything
i 'm the only one that can UNknown that bomb
anybody on the scene yet ?
they 'r e arriving now but remember this is miles
the cemetery might just be the first step
why have i been doing this shit all day ?
if he wanted to kill us he should UNknown e done it when he had the chance
two things hank had me working on they 'r e not making any sense
i ran a trace on all five numbers from earlier
they were all connected to the device under the streetcar
not only that miles had remote cameras in the elevator shaft
he blew the device early danny
you still had five seconds to save willie
danny why are we stopping ?
willie was always gonna die
what are you talking about ?
miles had security cameras in the elevator
saw i was gonna save him and blew the charge early
and all those numbers all five of them were connected to the same streetcar
you already told me once george
i don 't even know him
every time he plays what does miles want ?
miles wants to be the guy that nobody can beat
the deal with samuel and joshua
he went to a lot of trouble to get some revenge
he steals from the u s military he sells it for a profit
he 's had molly for over three and a half hours
not once has he mentioned ransom
this isn 't about revenge
it is about the money
office called said willie UNknown 's a no show
this guy 's had us runnin all day
for one second we UNknown e just gotta stop and think
today what did i actually do ?
does this even matter ?
you 'r e still the only one who can UNknown that bomb
that 's what he did to get you to play
what else happened at the hotel ?
he blew the gas lines
they evacuated three city blocks
any one of those numbers any one would UNknown e gone back to that very streetcar
i had to stop the streetcar
you had to cut the power
after UNknown when the power was out all over the city
UNknown security comes in to move all the unprotected cash
one of the buildings that we evacuated is a temporary holding facility for the bureau of engraving and printing
glad y 'a ll got here
our backup generator 's gonna run out at midnight
fed 's been pullin all the old hundreds and UNknown out of circulation
that 's the entire southeast UNknown
total 's just over 100 million ?
hey ray you go with swat to the mint and you shut everything down all cars all UNknown
you stop it and you lock it in the quarter
we got eight minutes to get you to the cemetery
don 't you want miles ?
thank me when it 's over
only emergency vehicles are leaving the quarter
miles isn 't gettin anywhere
hey what are you doin ?
that asshole even told me to wear the hat and use the siren
everything i did today had a purpose
from the time molly walked out the door there isn 't a thing i did today that miles didn 't plan
he makes sure i wreck the fire truck so he could steal it
he threatens my brother so i 'm not thinking straight
he shows me molly to keep me in the game
if she 's still alive molly 's his ticket out
now where are those body bags ?
explosion reported outside east wing

my love is growin ?? ??
let 's get you home
when i wake it fades to silence ?? ??
there 's a thousand miles between us ?? ??
and a thousand days ?? ??
but i can feel you ?? ??
i can still feel you ?? ??
against my skin ?? ??
still you keep me warm ?? ??
UNknown UNknown i can feel you ?? ??
i take those boots but i find it difficult to make
given their status tu les UNknown for next to nothing
it is a brave boy
he wants m UNknown UNknown on the order
if it does not pay soon i broke the skull
i would find another husband
kill him yes and thou shalt have more orders
it is just out and yelled your name
you want to take away ?
i am responsible for him
now it is my cup
i am yours in a minute
let 's talk about your last report
the band of devil 's lair was stopped
the people are quiet for once then you deduce that they are afraid
who told you that ?
you UNknown e felt ?
there was something in the air
you 'r e there to bring the facts
not to sniff the air
and these nonsense about a white man who claims to be the UNknown of an african leader ?
i did not say so
do you really believe ?
i have forwarded a copy the prefect of police
he wants to be entrusted with the case
what are you doing here ?
they engage in ceremonies even more astounding
well i am not quite convinced but there is sufficient evidence
you are now a civilian
my kingdom a free man !
i will be until the day where you UNknown dragged me to the altar
put your business in the pen
sally and i are going to the cottage
do you dream again ?
our cottage will it be like that one day ?
it is only the beginning
i will kill them all
they are light years us and they tell us how to act !
i fought against the disease and floods but not against anybody
but if a bastard wants to evict me
i spent almost 40 years in this farm
i will die of old age or a shot whatever
these UNknown can not understand what happens on these lands
what it is to do everything ourselves
before it was a wild land
nobody helped me except UNknown
UNknown it 's good for your blood
my blood pressure goes very well !
i 'm lame not deaf
when i crossed the road UNknown 15 shillings in my pocket and all my possessions in a cart
when you started to flirt with sally
you UNknown me with your gun when you clean it
thank you to remember !
but he was never charged

i already made plans !
you proceed with the UNknown and i will be manager
i returned for my money you think ?
do not you go to your head
i want to buy a bed
of cedar with goat leather and fabric of the UNknown
yes ma 'a m and satin pillows !
thus money will end soon
if you do not spend is as if not you have had
money which the box as the stones are not worth anything
i had to marry UNknown !
yes but he had no eyes and the UNknown strong points where i know
he sold a dead dog but he was alive and he hurt five silver UNknown
what do the five UNknown ?
i give them back with interest
this time go to jail

UNknown ii ho i people are real !
i have treated always the way it is

and yet as UNknown !
of UNknown ie not want to give names
i hate to praise me
i believe you if you say that i am met wife governor UNknown
i met her when walking by judea
he wanted to go to rome
but i don 't like people in high society are not ordinary and with them UNknown
i like more than to stay on the streets our old fashioned
they arrested jesus of nazareth !
yes the one who makes miracles !
a great man but he went to the head
he had great success if i had listened

may i ask you a question ?
how did you get your first car for your first rally ?
i don 't remember any more
did you apply without a car ?
yes this one is not mine and i haven 't money to rent one
i can 't wait to drive in this rally
you caught me a little unaware
don 't you have a friend whom you can ask for money ?
no no i haven 't any and i must absolutely take part in this rally
i put in it all my
i don 't know how to explain
the hard part is to achieve results to be successful to compete at a high level to be a name
can 't you help me at all ?
don 't you know what i could do ?
the rally begins the day after tomorrow
no but i wish you could manage it
let me go what 's got into you ?
your friend told me everything !
you are a bastard !
don 't touch the number plate
you want the number plate ?
go and get it !
i don 't care at all about the plate
i could go in jail !
now return the car soon
see you in a quarter of hour at the UNknown
i UNknown l arrive first
has the selection already be done ?
are you paul UNknown ?
i have applied with a UNknown i ve number 9
i 'd like to know if it s possible to change vehicle
you have to maintain the same category
look it 's badly parked and its brakes don 't work
may i start in a UNknown or a jaguar ?
with one of these two ?
yes i wanted to know just in case
if it 's just in case have your brakes repaired
you are the cause of the crash then you blame the others !
that 's not true !
if you hit me i UNknown l break your face
he is a road hog !
he drives around with that old crock !
he cut me up !
give me the paper turban idiot
i UNknown e return you that old crock
but it 's an exceptional car
you lost your number nine
for heaven 's sake !
how long should i wait ?
actually it 's the same wherever you go
the other hair dresser has burnt me !
has burnt your hair ?
that 's a shame !
by the way some days ago a UNknown caught fire
did you read it in the newspaper ?
if you read it in a newspaper
it said that someone was naked
they were all wearing pyjamas
i UNknown l wait for you to continue our little talk
what do you think about washing my hair ?
i think of my mum
and are you always thinking of her ?
i 'm not here for thinking
when you think something what do you think ?
let it remain between you and me
i 'm always thinking about cars
you have already come here with a UNknown
i just wanted to know if you still have it
if it absolutely has to be a UNknown there are three UNknown
buy one rent one things that seem to be ruled out or being kind to someone who owns one
how much does it cost to rent one ?
you 'd better telephone someone who owns a UNknown
when you get a tip at least say thanks
it wasn 't a tip it was the address of a UNknown
i 'm calling for the renting of a UNknown
no it 's just for a few days
but that 's not possible !
is it the same for just one day ?
tomorrow i UNknown l steal something at the car UNknown to make some money
go there at night time with a girl
will you give me a sausage ?
ah that 's why this morning i made a fool of you
but you are a fool !
i gave you 20 francs to put a sausage in the car 's exhaust
come on give me a sausage !
you want a sausage ?
i have money to buy a sausage
those people gave me money to buy your sausages
i UNknown e come here as you asked
this is my private mode of transport it 's quite responsive

ah i get it !
you prefer the old ones
those with a big belly
come on get in !
it 's beautiful isn 't it ?
did you get the catalogue ?
there is one in the boot
we are closing exit please !
miss i invite you to pass the evening in the boot of a car
if you had told me so i would have thought you were crazy
miss i invite you to pass the evening in the boot of a car
do you still think i 'm crazy ?
didn 't you really hear anything ?
so why did you get off ?
because you played your cards right
you are an asshole !
because a man who wants to bed you who has a UNknown is worth more than a man with a UNknown
he is beautiful the man on the UNknown !
then why did you come here with me ?
isn 't that enough ?
yes that 's true you 'r e right
it already happened that a man wants to bed me in his car or on foot
i am the first on a UNknown !
isn 't it good ?
it 's a perfect alibi if they catch me !
are you here to flatten the tyres
no to steal some spare parts i need UNknown francs
can 't you just steal ?
i m not a thief
and i 'm not an alibi
don 't touch me !
let me get out or i UNknown l slap you !
i didn 't come here to steal !
i have no money for a hotel and my mum doesn 't want me home

even if you had that damned car i wouldn t leave with you
the pilot sends you to hell
i 'd give to you the UNknown francs but i wouldn 't leave with you

so go and take a ride
you instead you have grown up in front of the mirror first standing up on your UNknown to see that nice little face
later to learn how to tie your ribbon
and is it up to me ?
is it up to me to say the price ?
i 'm not finished yet with this lady
i wouldn t do this price even for my daughter
what are you waiting for ?
i 'm waiting for you two to finish so i can leave with her
i can 't take care of you alone

where do you go ?
don 't you care wait here and i UNknown l come back with money
do you know where the brake pedal is ?
i also know where the UNknown is
with a UNknown it would be better
because with a UNknown it
do you hope i will add a UNknown behind your number plates ?
i didn 't ask you for anything
was it by chance that we met at the fashion show ?
or was it by chance that you had the wig with you ?
you know with chance sometimes it 's lucky others not
this time it wasn 't unlucky
this was your plan !
you smile and when she asks you what you want you answer
i requested a UNknown but i just have the number plates
please may i ask you to take me back to the fashion show because down there there is a a friend with a car
how much do you need ?
you know this doesn 't matter anymore !
and it has to be a UNknown 1600 or a 912 ?
no it 's a 911 s
let 's do this you come to my place and we UNknown l talk about it quietly
try to understand first of all i must win the rally !
can we go now ?
it 's too late now the shop is closed
yes i know but the deposit is my guarantee !
this is some money plus these wigs are worth plenty
sorry what is it all about ?
they are worth UNknown francs !

a hand UNknown off here brings about UNknown 300 000
ifyou hack it off up here by the elbow there 's another 60 000

i mean UNknown whole iower arm is gone you 'r e a cripple
but a missing hand is a sign of character
a chic one at that !
i was thinking of something noble but i 'm not sure

maybe i should just UNknown UNknown fingers
the thumb is the most important
add two fingers and you get 120 000

five score years ago a great american in whose symbolic shadow we stand today signed the UNknown proclamation
this momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of negro slaves who had been UNknown in the flames of UNknown injustice
it came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity
but one hundred years later the negro still is not free
the life of the negro is still sadly crippled by the UNknown of UNknown and the chains of discrimination
one hundred years later the negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity
one hundred years later the negro is still UNknown in the corners of american society
who 's on the radio ? and finds himself in exile in his own land
now we need our own money
we need our fucking money
so what do you say about it ?
there 's no fucking shit !
you think i 'm stupid ?

where 's my little brother ?
who your little brother ?
you think i can kill a child ?
i saw you kill a little boy for oranges
how do you know i killed a boy for oranges ?
it wasn 't for oranges i killed him
he fired at my pickup and was trying to escape
we captured him in the old town
i asked him what was in his bucket
he said bananas and i kicked the bucket and it was oranges
he tried to escape and i killed the man
lf i had met him on the front he would have killed me too
was he your brother ?
so who says when they don 't need you they won 't get rid of you ?
it 's fine on you
it 's fine around your neck
i don 't need your gift
take the book it 's for you !
can 't you read ?
you go to sunday church to worship jesus christ ?
you 'r e a virgin !
i got all the women
i only need to pick one
UNknown is not the same as loving
you 'r e not talking ?
you started the talking talk now
now you 'r e scared
UNknown UNknown at a young age and was never given a name
people simply called me nameless
with no family name to live up to i devoted myself to the sword
i spent ten years UNknown unique skills as a swordsman
the king of qin has summoned me to court for what i have accomplished has astonished the kingdom
by order of his majesty we have travelled overnight to bring the warrior to see you prime minister
sky snow and broken sword
for ten years these three assassins from zhao have repeatedly plotted to kill his majesty so he has not known a single peaceful night 's sleep
t UNknown we discover that a hero from our great kingdom of qin has single UNknown wiped out the enemy
from now on his majesty can once more sleep without fear !
his majesty 's UNknown congratulate him
heaven has sent a great warrior to UNknown the assassins !
by his majesty 's command summon the warrior !
when you enter the palace always remain one hundred paces from the throne or you will be killed without question
please do not forget !
for ten years no one 's approached within one hundred paces of the throne
do you know why ?
as long as there are assassins i cannot remove my armour
now that you have rooted out this evil on our behalf what do you desire as a reward ?
t o rid great qin of its enemies is my duty
in accordance with qin law you must be properly rewarded
sky 's silver spear has wounded UNknown numbers of our brave qin warriors
by order of his majesty he who UNknown the assassin sky will be awarded 1 000 pieces of gold and authority over 1 000 UNknown
advance within twenty paces of the throne and drink with his majesty !
according to my UNknown you are a citizen of qin
your humble servant nameless prefect of lan UNknown district
a mere local prefect !
with authority over no more than ten square miles !
this is the lowest rank of office in our kingdom
what UNknown you to overcome the three deadly assassins from zhao ?
i dealt with them one at a time
perhaps your majesty has heard that broken sword and snow were lovers ?
and was your majesty aware that they had not spoken to each other for three years ?
three years without words ?
snow had spent one night with sky as lovers
broken sword took this to heart
why have i not heard about this ?
it took your servant much effort to uncover this secret
t o create a UNknown between snow and broken sword i had first to dispose of sky
i am beginning to fathom your strategy
your majesty is most UNknown
within lan UNknown it is my responsibility to arrest criminals
on the fifth day of the sixth month sky appeared in a chess house
i had heard that he was a lover of chess and music and was a frequent visitor
the seven elite guards from qin court
we have been trailing you for days
you are under arrest !
what can i do for you ?
you are a wanted criminal !
i am here to arrest you !
sir would you be kind enough to play us another tune ?
martial arts and music share the same principles
both wrestle with complex chords and rare UNknown
we stood facing each other for a long time neither of us made a move while our combat UNknown in the depths of our minds
how swift your sword must be !
i UNknown myself in knowing every corner of our land
by edict of his majesty the assassins broken sword and flying snow have always worked as partners
he who UNknown either one of them is awarded 1 0 thousand pieces of gold and authority over 5000 UNknown
advance within ten paces and drink with his majesty !
three years ago snow and broken sword stormed our palace together
three thousand soldiers were unable to resist them
i have since had this great hall emptied so there is nowhere to hide !
so how did you manage to overcome them ?
i was disguised as a citizen UNknown and went searching for them there
it was UNknown they were hiding in a small UNknown school
i arrived as your majesty 's troops approached
only the students and their master remained
why have you come at such a time ?
i am from a small province in zhao
my father 's dying wish was to acquire a scroll from your UNknown school
i fear this may be the last day of our school
my honourable guest whose UNknown do you seek ?
broken sword 's power was immediately apparent to me
rumour had it that his martial arts skills were rooted in his UNknown
in order to discover the swordsman
i had first to study the UNknown
my honoured guest is fond of swords ?
i am merely fulfilling my father 's last wish
a scroll of that size requires red ink
master wishes to borrow some red ink from the mistress
master wishes to borrow some red ink
has mistress heard my request ?
master wishes to borrow some red ink
t ell him to come himself
your student respectfully requests some red ink
your majesty 's army has never lost a war because they never underestimate their enemy
you must all remember the arrows of qin may be powerful
they may penetrate our cities and destroy our kingdom
but they can never UNknown our written words !
the zhao people did they really not move ?
people from zhao are particularly strong in spirit
you asked for the character sword
why was it difficult to do ?
there are normally nineteen ways of writing this character
what i requested from broken sword was the twentieth variation
UNknown and UNknown both rely on UNknown the power of the wrist with the spirit in the heart
this twentieth variation would reveal the essence of his swordsmanship
to think that one character can be written nineteen different ways !
how can people communicate when they do not understand each other ?
once i have conquered the six kingdoms and suppressed all other rebellious states
i shall rid the country of these hopeless UNknown keep one UNknown language for the whole land
wouldn 't that be something ?
is your majesty not stopping after UNknown the six kingdoms ?
the six kingdoms are nothing !
i intend to lead our army to every corner of this land until we have established a vast and powerful empire !
you must be mistress flying snow
why are you leaving ?
i am going to fend off the arrows
the archers of qin are legendary
mistress snow is far superior
you have not come for the UNknown
i have brought something to show you
but you have not seen me use my sword
without your sword this scroll would not exist
please meet me in the library at midnight
i have something to show you
while several hundred thousand qin troops were preparing for the next UNknown
i spent the night contemplating the scroll hoping to discover the secret behind broken sword 's skills
you say this UNknown contains the mystery of UNknown but i cannot see anything unusual here
the brush and the sword are UNknown connected
their mystery is only revealed to those who can perceive the connection
then how were you able to challenge the two of them ?
why have you come ?
i am a citizen of qin
sky said he had always lived his life without burden or responsibility
sky said he was certain UNknown avenge his death
i know you saw us !
i deliberately wanted you to see us !
we are both very foolish
what are you laughing at ?
what you did last night it was UNknown stupid
when we fought i could see that my plan had worked
she was emotional and agitated unable to focus
who would have thought that broken sword and snow were so emotionally fragile
would you like to UNknown kind of impression they made on me ?
three years ago i had once fought them face to face
i found them both honourable and exceptional hardly the narrow minded people you say
that is why snow and sky did not have an affair
snow and broken sword were not enemies
in other words your entire story is a lie !
only one thing was true
sky must have known one of you
i suspect you and sky were allies
you were able to defeat him for one reason only
he lost to you deliberately !
in order to assassinate me the two of you staged a fight using my guards as witnesses
laying this trap was not difficult
the hard part was in persuading sky to place his life in your hands
your sword may be swift but not enough to defeat sky
yet he willingly fell under your blade
what courage what gallantry !
so sky became your first accomplice
sky was a proud man who regarded himself without equal in this land
what made him think that you would succeed where he had failed ?
unless in order to assassinate me you had spent the last ten years UNknown a unique skill a lethal manoeuvre that no one can counter ?
having defeated sky you could already come within twenty paces of the throne
why did you need broken sword and snow as well ?
i suspect you have to be within ten paces of your target to be effective
so you required one more accomplice to help you advance another ten paces !
i believe that even though broken sword and snow had never met sky
they understood at once why he had agreed to your plan
how far am i from the UNknown ?
t en paces it is
i only need one of you to help me
t UNknown morning at the qin army encampment
sky was one of the greatest warriors of our times
yet he was willing to give his life to this man
that is why he has the ability to assassinate qin 's king
to go is to die
you are one step ahead of me
i fear i have inflicted too deep a wound
i should have been the one to go
i want you to go on living
if you died how could i live ?
promise me you will live well when i have gone
moon will soon be here to take care of you
your servant nameless the prefect of lan UNknown
i have come to zhao to catch this assassin
please let me fight her alone
this is a dangerous criminal wanted by his majesty
now that she has been found it is my duty to arrest her
i have a prior agreement with the assassin to fight her alone
if i am unable to succeed please feel free to step in
please grant me permission to proceed
make your move now !
i die willingly for our cause
please make your move !
how swift your sword is !
i suspect you had a battle with broken sword as well
like the fight between you and sky you and broken sword fought in the depth of your minds
except neither of you wanted to harm the other but were content to go through the honourable motions
this was also a tribute to snow
master asked me to give you his sword
why has he done this ?
master and snow will always be together in life or in death and their swords will never be apart
master asked me to give you his sword to help assassinate qin 's king
sky broken sword and snow gave themselves in different ways in order that you could come within ten paces of me
all three were willing to entrust their lives to you
surely one can ask no more of a friend
that is why you are the most dangerous assassin of them all !
how did your majesty figure this out ?
the candle flames in front of me can sense your murderous intent
the three of them and you were all willing to die for your cause
i am ashamed to say i cannot measure up to your courage !
your majesty has seen through our plan
i have only just worked it out
why else would i have allowed you to come this close ?
a man from qin would never try to kill me
i am a man of zhao
my family was killed by the qin army
UNknown i was taken in by a family here in qin
ten years ago i discovered my real identity and decided to assassinate you
so you are here on behalf of zhao
i presume you have perfected a lethal move ?
just as your majesty suggests there is indeed such a move
and what is it ?
within ten paces i cannot fail
my guards are outside a hundred paces away while you are only ten paces from me
it would seem that i shall not escape my fate today
and yet you hesitate ?
your majesty is most UNknown
it was imperative that i proved to them that my sword was not only swift but perfectly accurate
within ten paces i can strike with surgical precision
the sword will enter and exit the body avoiding all vital organs so the wound is deep but not fatal
i respectfully request one of you to take such a blow from me in order to deceive qin 's king
to take such a blow from you asks a great deal of us
how is sky now almost fully recovered
he certainly had faith in your skills
the security around the king is UNknown
this is the only way
the imperial guards are not worth a mention
the king of qin should have died three years ago
i did not go through with it
the king of qin must not be killed
i asked the same question
what was his answer ?
he was unwilling to explain on that day
of the three only broken sword was my match
that was why what he said next worried me greatly
as long as i am alive i shall prevent you from UNknown the king
i am willing to help you
three years ago somebody wasted a golden opportunity
this time we must not fail
tomorrow morning i shall meet you at the qin encampment
i would like to ask a favour
what are you waiting for ?
although i had agreed to help snow it did not seem honourable to attack broken sword
you are no match for him !
i knew you would do this
now you cannot stand in my way
even wounded i can still stop you
in that case i shall have to kill you
i worry i may have wounded him too deeply
with mistress medicine master should be out of danger in a day
have you delivered the medicine yet ?
i tended master 's wound myself
the qin guards will not ill treat a servant
if the assassination is successful return with a red flag
if it fails a yellow one
if mistress meets with misfortune at the duel what would be the point ?
when i look down from heaven the red flag will bring a smile to my lips
how is snow she is recovering
i am here without her knowledge
you once said as long as you are here you would try to stop me
abandon your plan to assassinate the king
do you know i am from zhao ?
then whom do you speak for ?
how can you call yourself a man of zhao ?
snow asked me the same question once
the year we met i was a wanderer with no home to call my own
she was the daughter of the great general zhao UNknown who lost his life during a battle against qin
she had vowed to avenge her father 's death
i wanted to help her
UNknown and UNknown share the same source and principles
so we practiced UNknown every day in the hope that it would UNknown our skills and increase our power
snow knew i had been UNknown since childhood
she often said to me once we had succeeded in killing the king she would take me back to her home
she said no swords existed there and no swordsmen
there would only be a man and a woman
the truth of UNknown has to be UNknown UNknown
it is the same with UNknown
both seek to return to a state of simplicity
gradually i began to understand
three years ago i reached the peak of my training
snow felt it was time to attempt the assassination
together we stormed the palace
snow asked me why did i not go through with our plan
i told her the king of qin must not be killed
this was something i had come to realize through studying UNknown
because i spared the king
snow turned her back on me
was all your training UNknown by hatred and revenge ?
for ten years i worked UNknown without a moment 's rest
what will it take to UNknown you ?
you will have to kill me
in that case i shall make you a gift of two words
these words reflect what is in my heart
moon give my sword to the nameless hero
just as snow and i will always be together our swords will never be apart
master nameless even though i am only a lowly servant please permit me a few words
i have served my master since i was eight
from him i learnt the martial arts and how to live with principles
my master is never wrong
what he wrote must be important
master nameless please consider his advice carefully
broken sword said for years there has been continuous warfare causing huge suffering to the people
only your majesty has the power to bring peace by UNknown our land
he hoped that for the sake of the greater good
i would abandon my plan to kill you
broken sword also said one person 's pain is nothing when compared to the suffering of all
the conflict between zhao and qin is nothing when compared with peace for all
who would have thought an assassin would understand me the best !
alone in my position i have endured endless criticism endless attempts on my life
no one has ever UNknown what i have been trying to do
even my own court regards me as a tyrant
and yet broken sword a man i barely knew was able to see clearly what is truly in my heart
i want to know that without a sword how do you intend to kill me ?
for ten years this sword has accompanied me to every battle
to have been understood by a man such as broken sword allows me to face death without fear or regret
let the good of our country guide your decision !
i have just come to a realization !
this scroll by broken sword contains no secrets of his swordsmanship
what this reveals is his highest ideal
in the first stage man and sword become one and each other
here even a blade of grass can be used as a lethal weapon
in the next stage the sword UNknown not in the hand but in the heart
even without a weapon the warrior can slay his enemy from a hundred paces
but the ultimate ideal is when the sword disappears altogether
the warrior embraces all around him
the desire to kill no longer exists
your majesty i have now completed my mission
because of my decision today many will die and your majesty will go on living
a dead man begs you never to forget the ultimate ideal for a warrior
nameless came within ten paces of the king
he could not have failed
there can be only one explanation
he must have given up willingly
what did you say to him ?
is that all there is in your heart ?
i don 't believe you
how can i convince you ?
you have killed nameless betrayed sky and destroyed zhao
when we first met you asked me to draw my sword then
is the sword the only answer ?
why did you not defend yourself ?
so you would finally believe me
i have always wanted to go home with you
that will not happen now
on your own you must take good care of yourself
why didn 't you block my sword ?
why didn 't you block it ?
why didn 't you ?
your majesty permission to execute ?
your majesty permission to execute ?
your majesty permission to execute ?
this man cannot be trusted !
he tried to kill you !
do not spare him !
this is the sacred law of qin !
if your majesty is to unite the land this man has to be made an example of !
your majesty execute him !
your majesty execute him !
your majesty execute him !
your majesty execute him !
your majesty execute him !
your majesty execute him !
this series is about perhaps the most powerful idea ever to occur to a human mind
the idea is evolution by natural selection
and the genius who thought of it was charles darwin
i 'm a UNknown and darwin has been an inspiration to me throughout my whole career
his masterpiece on the origin of species was published 150 years ago
and it changed forever our view of the world and our place in it
what darwin achieved was nothing less than a complete explanation of the UNknown and UNknown of all life
and yet it 's one of the simplest ideas that anyone ever had
in this series i want to persuade you that evolution offers a far richer and more spectacular view of life than any religious story
it 's one reason why i don 't believe in god
i want to show you how darwin opened our eyes to the extraordinary reality of our world
in this first programme i 'm going to tell you who charles darwin was explain how he discovered his theory of evolution what it is and why it matters
by the end i hope to have convinced you of the truth that evolution is a fact backed by UNknown evidence
and i want to give you a glimpse of the brutal elegance of the force which darwin realised drives evolution on natural selection
when charles darwin was born 200 years ago sailors and explorers were sending home a UNknown array of specimens like these from all parts of britain 's growing empire
every animal was believed to have a unique place in god 's creation each made by god according to his perfect UNknown design
at school in UNknown the young charles darwin was taught that god had created the earth and all this rich variety of life just 6 000 years ago
i think it 's scandalous how little our children are taught about evolution at school
a typical class gets just a few hours to study one of the most important ideas in science
i went to meet a science class of 15 to 16 year UNknown at park high school in london to try to open their eyes to UNknown
why do we need to find out about evolution ?
why do we need to find out about evolution ?
because it is the explanation for our existence and because it explains such a huge number of facts because everything we know about life is explained by it
i believe in my religion so whenever i read about evolution
i can 't understand it i don 't believe it
i just like believe my religion
right so you know what you believe when you start and any new book that says anything different you don 't read it ?
even if you UNknown e got evidence
i just like i UNknown e found a stronger evidence which is the holy book so
so the reason you believe it is because that 's the one you were told first ?
i can see that a few hours in the science lab is no match
for a lifetime of religious UNknown
i was brought up to believe it
is that a good reason to believe something ?
yeah because i went to church since i was little
yeah and it says it in the bible
yes but in the hindu sacred scriptures it says something different doesn 't it ?
yeah they 'r e brought up to believe that
you can 't just say that
well look i hate this phrase made to believe that 's awful and i would hate anybody to think
i was trying to make anybody believe anything
i 'm asking you to look at the evidence
perhaps you haven 't got a full impression of how strong the evidence actually is
that 's sort of the way it is
there 's only one thing for it
i 'm going to show them evidence
something they can touch with their own hands see with their own eyes
later we UNknown l see if i can make them think again
when charles darwin was a UNknown
he would have been as much of a UNknown
as some of these children
darwin was born into a prosperous UNknown family in UNknown
his father was a doctor and keen that his son should follow in his scientific footsteps
but the adolescent charles more interested in shooting and fishing than academic prowess was contemplating an easy life as a country parson
luckily for him and for us he had the opportunity to open his eyes to see the world
in UNknown as a young man of 22
darwin 's family connections got him a once in a lifetime invitation a round the world voyage on the survey ship UNknown beagle
over five years darwin collected hundreds and hundreds of specimens to send back to the collections
but increasingly he wasn 't satisfied with just recording the animals and plants he saw
he was beginning to have doubts about the biblical story of how animals were created
while ashore riding across the south american UNknown
darwin amused himself by chasing after UNknown shy ostrich like UNknown birds
why had god bothered to create two very similar but slightly different types of UNknown ?
had an original group of UNknown split in two and once separated started to develop in their own way ?
the mystery UNknown when darwin noticed an even more marked effect on islands
i was lucky enough to UNknown darwin 's footsteps on the UNknown islands last year
here he began to wonder why god would have created UNknown kinds of tortoise finch or UNknown on more or less identical small islands
were UNknown like these related rather than separately created ?
were they cousins of the similar but different UNknown on nearby islands ?
this pattern of relationships became even more intriguing when darwin encountered fossils
the evidence of fossils would help darwin develop a theory of life on earth far more wonderful and more moving than any religious story of creation
this team of american scientists has uncovered the remains of two million year old ground UNknown
today i 'm joining the dig because it was fossils like these that made a huge impression on the young charles darwin during his voyage on UNknown beagle
to darwin they looked like ancient giant versions of animals he saw around him
man the ground UNknown UNknown for millions of years and were quite successful
they were huge weren 't they ?
they were bear sized up to almost UNknown UNknown and UNknown up to six metres in height when they reared up onto their hind legs
UNknown what struck darwin was how apart from their enormous size the fossils closely resembled in every other detail the skeletons of modern UNknown living nearby
man you can see UNknown in the details of their teeth peculiar features that they share with modern UNknown modern tree UNknown and modern UNknown
we can UNknown that they are related to these animals
UNknown the discovery of fossils was a huge challenge to the religious UNknown of darwin 's youth
what were these animals ?
when had they lived ?
and why didn 't they exist any more ?
some suggested that fossils were just god UNknown UNknown his world
others claimed they were the bones of sinners drowned in noah 's flood
but darwin was one of the first scientists to correctly identify them as long dead species of animals
he was starting to grasp that the earth might be a lot older than the bible led us to believe
and how had he realised this ?
through a fascination with geology
during the voyage of the beagle
darwin had had time to UNknown himself in the UNknown work of charles UNknown
UNknown argued that the landscape we saw around us was formed by the slow action of vast forces not thousands but millions of years of UNknown change
so if the earth was shaped and UNknown over an immense period of time was there room darwin began to wonder for life to undergo slow changes as well ?
you know how old these rocks are ?
they 'r e about 200 million years old
back in the 19th century lots and lots of people came here to look for fossils
and some of the most famous fossils have been found here
i 'm taking the science class i met earlier to the beach
many of these UNknown have been brought up
to mistrust the idea of evolution
i 'm hoping they UNknown l find a small fragment of the kind of evidence
that made charles darwin think again
do you know what our ancestors were like 200 million years ago ?
they were around they wouldn 't have been here because this would have been the bottom of the sea
they would have been kind of like UNknown little UNknown UNknown
it seems to be like a dream but it 's real
yeah yes it does doesn 't it ?
this is all UNknown rock meaning it 's laid down at the bottom of the sea mud coming down
layer after layer after layer that 's what fossils are
on a beach like this
the pounding sea gradually UNknown different layers of rock
and within them hidden treasure
a history of past life on earth
so each layer you go down to
the fish gradually changed into UNknown changed into reptiles reptiles changed into birds changed into UNknown
that 's a beautiful UNknown
well done for finding that
the fossil hunt has been a success
like darwin these UNknown have been brought face to face
with some tangible UNknown of evolution
the evidence darwin had seen with his own eyes on the voyage of the beagle UNknown huge UNknown questions in his mind
and once he started thinking he couldn 't stop
darwin once an easily distracted student returned from the voyage of the beagle a determined even UNknown research scientist
the trip had changed him and it was soon to change the world forever
back in london in the late UNknown the specimens he 'd collected and his reporting of the voyage made darwin a scientific celebrity
even more importantly while UNknown his finds
darwin realised that life forms weren 't fixed
they had changed over time
now he wanted to pull together all the evidence to understand how and why this had happened
it took darwin 20 years of research on and off to develop the ideas that would eventually be set out in the origin of species
the hard graft was done here at darwin 's home
long before the days of the internet of course
darwin drew upon the collective knowledge of an entire generation of UNknown all over the world
he sent out thousands of letters asking for data posing questions trying out theories
and back the letters flowed from all around the world into down house a river of information
darwin studied the detail of how different UNknown share remarkably similar skeletons
their limbs have the same bones in the same order just UNknown and UNknown to suit different ways of life
he was drawn to the similarity of early UNknown development in very different types of animals fish birds reptiles
increasingly he became convinced that every living thing must be related to every other
life had evolved from single cells into complex sophisticated beings
it may seem like a huge leap but darwin realised it had been achieved by small steps over a vast span of time
he UNknown the immense age of the earth
darwin believed the world was hundreds of millions of years old
today we know it 's over four billion years old and the life we can actually see around us has existed for an insignificant blink of that time
life had evolved over time
but how had this happened ?
why hadn 't creatures stayed the same ?
darwin 's bird specimens are now stored at the natural history museum at UNknown
it 's a very weird feeling these are actually darwin 's own specimens
i see from darwin 's own label here that this is a blue owl pigeon
UNknown are UNknown by this curious tumbling behaviour that they show sort of falling through the sky
this one has been UNknown it is a darwin specimen
this one actually has darwin 's original label here
darwin realised that for centuries through small steps pigeon UNknown had been in the business of evolution
here was life in constant flux
it was showing that there 's nothing static about species
now in his UNknown darwin became a pigeon UNknown
he kept some 90 birds of 16 types devoured books on breeding and attended numerous pigeon shows
what excited darwin was the powerful comparison that could be drawn between domestic breeding and what he 'd observed of nature acting on wild animals
like the UNknown he 'd collected in UNknown
in the pigeon 's case it 's artificial selection it 's human UNknown using their eye to choose
i think i UNknown l breed from that one i want the beak longer or shorter
i want the UNknown to be UNknown or UNknown
so breed from the one that has the quality you want and then after surprisingly few generations you can produce a change in the breed
in nature it 's not like that of course
nobody comes along and says
man had utterly transformed many animals and plants by UNknown for particular characteristics over and over again
nature was also doing this
but how could nature make specific choices as humans could ?
darwin 's answer would come in understanding exactly what nature is
how does nature select ?
today much of the world is controlled and cultivated by man but there are still a few remote places red in tooth and claw
i UNknown e come to kenya where i was born
it 's one of the wilder places on earth where the full force of natural selection can still be seen
the total amount of suffering in the natural world is beyond all decent UNknown
during the minute that it takes me to say these words thousands of animals are running for their lives whimpering with fear feeling teeth sink into their throats
thousands are dying from starvation or disease or feeling a parasite UNknown away from within
there is no central authority no safety net
for most animals the reality of life is struggling suffering and death
for darwin UNknown with nature 's horrors must have been a huge challenge
as a young man he had wanted to become a country parson
he had believed in an orderly and UNknown animal kingdom
now he UNknown the brutal reality of nature
darwin 's brilliance was to connect what he was seeing with an idea from a completely different discipline economics
thomas UNknown had written a popular influential UNknown about the UNknown of population growth in early industrial britain and how this would inevitably be stopped by food shortage and disease
darwin seized upon UNknown 's warning about a human struggle for resources and he applied it to what was happening in nature
as more individuals are produced than can possibly survive there must in every case be a struggle for existence
nature is an arena of pressure
of every individual born the chance of it surviving to reproduce the next generation is very very small
the next step for darwin was to realise this what makes the difference between success and failure in the struggle for existence isn 't just chance
if an animal survives it is more likely to reproduce and UNknown pass those variations on to its offspring
nature 's struggle for existence means that organisms with helpful variations tend on average to survive and reproduce
those without die without offspring
the finishing line is UNknown
this is what darwin UNknown as natural selection the key to evolution
natural selection is daily and UNknown UNknown throughout the world
every variation even the slightest
rejecting that which is bad
UNknown and adding up all that is good
we see nothing of these slow changes in progress
until the hand of time has marked the lapse of ages
gradually very gradually as successful variations are inherited natural selection UNknown life into different shapes better and better adapted to UNknown resources out of their particular surroundings
longer necks are UNknown to feed from tall trees
thinner fur for warmer UNknown
they are then classified as a distinct species
this is the origin of species
but evolution doesn 't stop there
these species are then themselves UNknown by the presence of other species
the environment in the form of lions is getting systematically worse from the point of view of a zebra
and from the point of view of a lion UNknown are getting systematically worse they 'r e getting better at running away
UNknown are getting better at catching prey
prey are getting better at escaping from UNknown
so there 's a kind of UNknown it 's an arms race
arms races account for the UNknown advanced engineering of life camouflage systems camera lens eyes venomous stings
arms races can be seen in unexpected places
mankind is certainly not immune to the nightmare darwin called
we humans are currently in a battle with UNknown
it 's being fought all round our world
today in the slums of UNknown natural selection acts through a UNknown disease cutting through the population
UNknown 's prostitutes have on average seven to ten clients per day with a high UNknown of UNknown which causes UNknown
i 'm richard a remarkable resistance to the virus
and during that time have you lost many friends to UNknown ?
i have lost many friends
when did you first discover that you are UNknown to UNknown ?
she knew for a long time but she actually believed completely in UNknown that she was UNknown
it 's not god at work here in all this squalor and suffering
and it 's not luck either
the resistance these women have seems to be a variation that can be passed on to their children
some of the women are related to each other UNknown we also think there is some factor in their blood in their cells that is probably UNknown transmitted
UNknown i suppose if we came back in 1 000 years we might expect to see a major shift in the frequency of these genes in the population ?
UNknown yes i think in any epidemic situation those people who are very vulnerable and susceptible will get sick and die
this is the UNknown force of natural selection first revealed by darwin now observed by modern science
back in england at down house now 20 years after his voyage on the beagle
darwin had worked out the answers to the biggest questions ever asked
but he was strangely reluctant to go public with his idea
darwin himself said that he 'd become a kind of machine for grinding theories out of huge UNknown of facts
i think that wasn 't really what it was like at all
he was an extraordinarily imaginative deep thinker
he had a UNknown curious mind as well
he was drawn to facts that didn 't fit
he once said i cannot bear to be beaten
darwin 's theory explained how the UNknown of life from the planet had evolved UNknown without interference from any god
but he was UNknown aware of how upsetting this flat contradiction of the religious story would be
then in june UNknown darwin received a letter from a UNknown travelling in the far east alfred UNknown wallace which set our similar ideas
darwin was in despair about being UNknown
he was even ready to drop his life 's work
but he was persuaded by charles UNknown and others to present his UNknown work alongside wallace 's notes and then complete his masterpiece for publication
i UNknown e come to meet UNknown UNknown darwin 's great great grandson to try to understand darwin 's frame of mind as he finished his book
this is a book about geology by mr UNknown
it has this wonderful inscription
charles darwin buenos aires october UNknown
so he 's on the beagle really getting into his stride as a geologist
this is a scrapbook a children 's scrapbook that belonged to darwin 's daughter annie
darwin was no aggressive UNknown
he didn 't take to the stage to UNknown his work
but sought to influence leading UNknown behind the scenes
by sending them proof copies of the book with UNknown letters attached
he would write things like this vile rag of a theory of mine
was that genuine modesty or was there an element of false modesty about it ?
it was entirely real um and this is a very strange point about him
through the years when he was UNknown himself for publication um he was at different times enormously confident in it and at other times he was utterly uncertain
he had a deep fear i think that one species would be discovered that had some element of its make up that could only have been designed
doubts may have UNknown in darwin 's mind but finally 150 years ago he set out his ideas on evolution and how it worked in the origin of species
the book sold out its first run of 1 250 copies within two days
it has never been out of print since
the origin turned our world upside down but still there was one big gap in darwin 's understanding
this is the most precious book in my collection
it 's a genuine first edition origin of species
but it 's not just the most precious book in my library
charles darwin 's origin of species is one of the most precious books in the entire library of our species
this book made it possible no longer to feel the necessity to believe in anything supernatural
it completely UNknown the way we see ourselves the world and our UNknown
but what darwin never cracked was how the improvements of natural selection were preserved from generation to generation why they didn 't become UNknown by UNknown
it was only in the 20th century in the UNknown UNknown revolution that scientists married evolution with UNknown
genes are the long strings of code instructions to the cells that build all living things
scientists now realise that genes from the parents don 't blend as they combine during UNknown
each gene is inherited in its UNknown or not at all
the science of the genes also showed how new variations arose
when animals reproduce their genes are copied and put into sperm and eggs
during that UNknown process occasionally there 's a random mistake
those mistakes are UNknown which give rise to new characteristics on which UNknown natural selection then acts
whether the cell builds a UNknown a horse or a human simply depends on the order of the letters in the code
just as darwin might have predicted animals more closely related by evolution have more UNknown in their code than more UNknown related animals
and these codes can be printed out right here in this man 's lab
in 2000 craig UNknown was among the first scientists to map the human UNknown our sequence of code letters
in the process this unlocked the ultimate proof of darwin 's tree of life
he was looking at the visible world and seeing how different it was
we now have the opportunity with this UNknown to look at the invisible world that he could only get hints of
and it shows that there 's vast continuity from the simplest life forms to the more complex
to me it 's not a theory any more
well evolution is a fact
i mean there 's no question about that and i 'm always being asked well produce the evidence !
and really you 'r e producing the best evidence of any
i mean fossils are nice but if we haven 't got a single fossil anywhere
the genetic code on its own is enough the evidence from this lab alone would be
not just enough but UNknown UNknown enough
darwin anticipated problems with his theory
modern science has answered them
evolution by natural selection has been UNknown UNknown as fact
a difference there same same same same
it 's such a shame that he didn 't live long enough to learn about dna
i already believed in evolution but this has just helped me to understand a bit more about it
we have talked about it in class more but i still do believe in god
but i 'm starting to think whether evolution is true or false
i do believe in evolution but i don 't think it 's ever going to be 100 accepted because there are many religious people out there
i thought about it more but i still believe in what the bible tells me
when richard came to our school today
i started learning about evolution and i 'd really love to learn more about it but i don 't want to like
leave my religion and go down that path
there is grandeur in this view of life
whilst this planet has gone UNknown on
according to the fixed law of gravity
from so simple a beginning
have been and are being evolved
thanks to darwin we alone of all species know that each and every one of us is a thread in the evolved fabric of life
darwin showed us that the world is beautiful and inspiring without a god
he revealed to us the glory of life and opened our eyes to who we really are and where we UNknown e come from
UNknown applied to mankind and our society its terrible misuse in attempts to justify cut throat competition even UNknown
we are the fifth ape
but even darwin hesitated to say this out loud
it throws into question our trust in our fellow human beings
are our morals and manners just a UNknown ?
since a struggle for existence drives evolution why don 't we humans run an entirely dog eat dog world ?
how about UNknown and UNknown cleansing ?
are they some kind of survival strategy ?
in this programme i want to confront the issue that darwin UNknown around in the origin of species the evolution of human beings
i want to ask what it means for us to be evolved
the question is more urgent than ever
increasingly religious people and others attack UNknown for in their view UNknown selfishness and UNknown
throughout my career i UNknown e UNknown with how to reconcile my liberal values with what darwin revealed to be the UNknown war of nature
so now i 'm going to take you into the UNknown heart of darkness and look for answers and for hope
natural selection is the driving force of our evolution but that doesn 't mean that society ought to be run on UNknown lines
as a scientist i 'm thrilled by natural selection but as a human being i UNknown it as a principle for UNknown society
evolution by natural selection is a very simple idea
over thousands of generations in a struggle for existence successful variations have survived to reproduce the process that gradually UNknown life into more and more UNknown forms
life forms that include the apes gibbons UNknown UNknown gorillas UNknown and us
here at london zoo back in the UNknown the arrival of the first apes outraged polite society
queen victoria for one found them painfully and UNknown human
but another visitor was UNknown
the african apes he realised were our closest UNknown cousins
east africa my birthplace and rather more importantly the birthplace of the human species itself
between five and six million years ago there lived in africa an ape who had two children
the answer is about 300 miles
over that surprisingly short distance the fossil record shows evidence of extraordinary changes
the UNknown richard UNknown and his family have uncovered the hard evidence in kenya 's UNknown valley evidence that charts the evolution of our ancient human ancestors
about 1 9 million years ago you have skulls like this turning up
this is what they were calling UNknown UNknown
UNknown brains still got a flat big face and probably ancestral to UNknown UNknown which turns up in africa at about 1 8 million years
this then is the ancestor to UNknown UNknown
this UNknown for almost a million years this condition and then it gives way to something with an even larger brain things that are much more like ourselves
so all the major steps in the human story are in fact told in africa
i often meet people who say to me nobody 's going to tell me i 'm an ape
is there a kind of UNknown UNknown ?
do you meet that as well ?
yes i do but it seems to be so misplaced because as you know we are the fifth ape
between the person on the other side of the cage
we 'r e closer to UNknown african UNknown than a horse is to an ass
horses and asses put together produce offspring
it 's an UNknown thought
in UNknown terms we 'r e so closely related to UNknown that it 's not ridiculous to ask whether we might still be able to breed with them
we 'r e the human animal upright big brained ape cousins who evolved to out think the competition
as a UNknown i UNknown e wondered at the challenging UNknown of this what it tells us about human society now
but over half the people on earth are so horrified by what UNknown reveals about our UNknown they just refuse to believe it
are you an ape ?
no i 'm not i 'm a human being
i 'm on a journey exploring the dark side of UNknown
i want to confront what it means for us to have evolved in nature 's brutal struggle
why should the fifth ape love thy neighbour ?
the thought of our animal UNknown can upset people
read the origin of species darwin 's masterpiece that set out his theory of evolution and you will find only a handful of passing references to human UNknown
that man was made in god 's image having dominion over the animals UNknown what it meant to be human so discussing human evolution was just too risky
darwin UNknown away from it and simply wrote near the end
light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history
but when the book came to be published in UNknown the buzz was all about the extraordinary UNknown for mankind
were we just beasts in fancy dress ?
evolution become known as the monkey theory
the row has not gone away
in kenya the cradle of mankind religious groups are trying to block the opening of the national museum 's exhibit of human fossils
the fossil record of human UNknown has a particular fascination
to me these are far more precious than the crown jewels
this is the UNknown boy
UNknown UNknown 1 5 million years old
the most complete ancient human skeleton ever found
it 's one of the most precious relics in any museum anywhere in the world
it would be an enormous pity if there were any pressure not to allow it to be seen
UNknown slngs a UNknown song
the ten million strong UNknown movement in kenya has run a hide the bones campaign
by coincidence i was born right next door to the church where the protest is being led by bishop UNknown UNknown
bishop how do you do ?
very nice of you to agree to this meeting
same here to meet the great professor
let 's go in shall we ?
i was born just over the road there
no i 'm told over the other side
it was clear that we weren 't going to see eye to eye from the beginning
made in the image of god in the creative mind of god creative as god is who made me
that 's the difference between the ape and me
well i 'm an ape
i 'm an african ape
i 'm very proud to be an african ape and so should you be
you are against UNknown it
everybody should make up their own mind
no i am not against the display
i am against the attachment of the evolution theory to the display
see that 's all we 'r e talking about
you 'd be happy for them to be displayed but not the UNknown messages ?
they are complete human being skulls
they 'r e very much smaller than ours and they UNknown e got very much less brain
the three million year old one had the same sized brain as UNknown
they were kind of UNknown on their hind legs so it was a first step towards becoming human
the next step was then in the UNknown boy to have a bigger brain and the final step was to have an even bigger brain like us
if that 's where we originated and evolved into this stage why aren 't those UNknown also UNknown into man ?
why aren 't they extinct ?
because by the time they developed to this level they should have been extinct
no that 's not the way evolution works
we 'r e not descended from them
we are cousins of them
so we and they go back to a common ancestor
there are the UNknown there 's us
we go back to a common ancestor
now that common ancestor was not a chimpanzee and it was not a human it was something else
our discussion now threw up an important point about evolution
so what is the goal of evolution ?
what is the ultimate goal ?
is it for us to have big heads ?
that doesn 't answer my question
where are we heading to ?
i mean up to where shall we say that this is the limit ?
it doesn 't have goals
it 's a misunderstanding to say evolution has goals
to understand evolution by natural selection you have to grasp that it is not a grand scheme with goals
it 's a harsh UNknown process which simply favours those that are most successful at passing on their genes
it has no morality or purpose
and we humans are just one of its products
darwin took man off his UNknown and made him an animal like all others
we evolved in the ruthless competition of nature
so what does that mean for us and our society ?
to begin to UNknown with this problem we have to understand what nature is in all its brutal glory
it looks like nature in harmony
actually as darwin realised there 's a struggle out there
all the players are working for their own benefit and because they are surrounded by others working for their own benefit they tend to exploit each other
in the shady forest all the plants are struggling to get to the light
big trees pay the price UNknown by growing up to the sun
but this strangler fig does a very strange and cruel thing
it started life high up in the tree from a seed perhaps dropped by a fruit eating monkey
it then sent roots down towards the ground in order to get nourishment from the ground
and then these roots UNknown all around the original tree and strangle it to death
eventually the original tree will die and the fig will be left standing on its own having UNknown its position in the sun
the bitter struggle for survival in nature has been the dynamic force that has driven the evolution of life
and this is where my own struggle with the consequences of UNknown begins
attacks on darwin have claimed that his UNknown UNknown theory has unleashed the worst of human nature
if nature is ruthless competition and nature is where we evolved then is this the model for human society ?
every man for himself ?
well let 's look at this
certain elements of business have always loved what they perceive as darwin 's message the strong must survive the weak perish
here is apparent justification for UNknown UNknown and denying help to the poor
several of the great UNknown of the early 20th century the so called robber UNknown like the oil tycoon john d rockefeller were UNknown social UNknown
't UNknown the giants of the oil industry
stand as monuments to rockefeller the architect of our business age
social UNknown is still with us
in the UNknown the american energy company UNknown ran a kind of nasty UNknown experiment
lining up 15 of the least fit of their UNknown to be fired each year
it didn 't end well
UNknown selected not necessarily the best but the most ruthless individuals who turned a blind eye to the UNknown fraud that brought the company down in scandal
i UNknown e come to a convention of UNknown in london to observe today 's business animal up close
my best friend 's a money broker in the city and has more money than he knows what to do with
one thing 's confusing me and that is why you 'r e here
your presentation i UNknown l put my cards on the table
i don 't like the UNknown industry generally
so are we looking at corporate apes fighting for UNknown
without compassion teeth UNknown ?
i wonder if it 's more UNknown than reality
do you think there 's a risk of overdoing the UNknown UNknown ? yes very much so
the press loves to play up company UNknown and UNknown as these heroes and in many ways they are
they work incredibly hard make great sacrifices
let customers decide which products and services they like best
i mean is it sort of luck that they 'r e the ones who UNknown e just they just happen to get it right ?
with UNknown you could say that they got it right
then if you ask that person what did you do ? they UNknown l say i 'm an expert coin UNknown
i UNknown e got my wrists just right
so UNknown in business seems to be little more than a UNknown an UNknown
it certainly doesn 't provide a straightforward natural law for economic progress as social UNknown used to argue
but can UNknown be applied to other areas of human affairs ?
what about taking back the reins of our own evolution ?
don 't copy nature but control it
UNknown UNknown they have been born UNknown are happier and more useful
in these institutions than when at large but it would have been better by far
if they had never been born
it 's been tried before
the UNknown movement of the early 20th century aimed to stop the weak UNknown through UNknown UNknown of the unfit
UNknown seeks to apply the known laws of UNknown so as to prevent the UNknown of the race and improve its UNknown qualities
here was a slippery slope down to a nightmare
at its worst UNknown became a dark tribal vision ultimately used to justify UNknown UNknown in nazi germany with UNknown echoes in UNknown and UNknown
i feel strongly that the UNknown that was the UNknown of UNknown in the 20th century was atrocious
but it 's important to say UNknown is not UNknown
UNknown is not a version of natural selection
hitler despite popular legend was not a UNknown
every farmer UNknown or pigeon UNknown knew how to breed for desired UNknown
UNknown like hitler borrowed from UNknown
what darwin UNknown realised was that nature can play the role of breeder
charles darwin argued in origin of species that evolution of life on earth had been driven by a brutal struggle for existence
natural selection can seem bleak for many UNknown
certainly nature can be UNknown and cruel
but i UNknown e been intrigued by what appear to be acts of kindness in nature warning cries UNknown for warmth and comfort and mutual UNknown
animals like these are UNknown what we call UNknown
they 'r e giving something to another at a cost to themselves
the question i UNknown e UNknown with as a UNknown is why
the explanation must at some point involve the brain
UNknown like any other behaviour must have evolved over time as brains have evolved
we UNknown e every reason to believe that the mind is a product of the activity of the brain
i happen to have one here
it 's clear that the brain is an organ
it 's got an UNknown history
i suppose we can all understand why sexual lust has a UNknown survival value
are you now saying that the UNknown for guilt trust that those are a bit like UNknown ?
but i think that as clear as it is that fear has an UNknown basis
i think our moral emotions can be analysed in the same way
i think stephen UNknown is right and we do have an evolved morality
but i also understand why there is resistance to the idea
why would the genes for the parts of the brain that involve giving at a cost to oneself be inherited in nature 's brutal struggle for existence ?
darwin UNknown this as sexual selection
to explore this i want to look at another case where individual survival doesn 't appear to be the priority
a peacock 's UNknown is gorgeous but it must get in the way of its own survival
it 's easily spotted by UNknown and its huge weight must hinder a quick escape
so why isn 't the peacock 's tail eliminated by natural selection ?
the sight of a feather in a peacock 's tail whenever i gaze at it he wrote
but it was darwin himself who hit upon the answer sex
because the tail wins sexual partners
something about the UNknown 's brain is attracted to bright feathers and extravagant maybe costly advertisement
peacock evolution has been shaped not UNknown by individual survival but by UNknown brains
UNknown in effect UNknown breed UNknown as pigeon UNknown breed pigeons
darwin UNknown this as sexual selection
evolution he now realised wasn 't just about which animals survived but which could prevail in winning the favours of the opposite sex
the naked cowboy keeping it real for you
a peacock is a walking advertising hoarding
a peacock 's tail with its eye spots is like a walking neon sign
these women want to become mothers through a sperm donor
it 's a kind of hi tech sexual selection
you 'r e looking for healthy attractive fit and intelligent
so i would want those qualities for my child the same qualities i would want in a partner
they 'r e appealing for people in general that 's how i look at it
for the women 's potential partners partners whom they never meet the process begins here
suitable pictures on the wall
of course you UNknown e got to have some UNknown material to help them along
but who are the women going to pick ?
are there any women who say just give me something at random ?
tell me a woman that has walked into a shoe shop and said just give me whatever you have
you spend time on your decisions
of course but in our society we pay lip service to the idea that there 's something taboo about UNknown choice
so you might think that women might as it were go along with that and say
i don 't approve of UNknown so
it 's america it 's a society of consultation and UNknown
you go online you buy products you ask questions
UNknown have to provide full and intimate details of all aspects of their life
shoe size and UNknown and skin tone if he UNknown easily
woman there is one that caught my eye
6 UNknown hazel eyes curly brown hair
if he 's a smoker
he likes the UNknown martin
but i want to return to the UNknown of UNknown
is it possible that among the qualities women want in a sperm donor
what 's fascinating is that the women don 't just want
the obvious alpha male qualities
there 's so many things that go into it than just looks and or intelligence
i don 't know how you put that in a form but he 's the nicest guy
he 's not the smartest guy he 's not the best looking guy
how do they know he 's the nicest ?
he 's actually written a really good extended profile about himself
i UNknown e actually met him and the profile checks out he is a really nice guy
so what 's going on here at a more fundamental level ?
this goes back to an old interest of mine
genes are UNknown instructions that build every living thing body and mind
they give rise to the UNknown family nose down through the generations
they dictate what colour eyes you have
but such examples are just the outward and visible tip of the iceberg
genes are copied from one generation to the next on and on
so they and they alone are immortal
the survival of the UNknown really means the survival of genes because it is only genes that really survive down through many generations
a gene that didn 't look after its own interests would not survive
that 's the meaning of the phrase selfish gene
ok so how can selfish genes support kindness ?
if genes are UNknown UNknown to make more copies of themselves how can a gene achieve this selfish objective by making its bearer behave UNknown ?
one part of the answer is UNknown
an UNknown gene can spread through the population so long as the UNknown is directed at other organisms that have the same gene
in other words at family
so selfish genes build parent animals who protect their young
in human terms parents who 'd rush into a burning building to save their children
this is called kin selection
the other part of the answer is UNknown UNknown
you scratch my back and i UNknown l scratch yours
selfish genes give rise to UNknown individuals
in the UNknown UNknown i wrote a book bringing these ideas together called the selfish gene
the idea that UNknown ultimately boils down to a survival game for genes raised UNknown but it 's now widely accepted among UNknown
but it 's not the end of the story
i realised there really does seem to be something odd about humans
aren 't humans rather nicer than even the selfish gene theory would expect ?
we donate to charity give blood weep in sympathy at the plight of complete strangers
now i want to explore why
i UNknown e been struggling all my life with why people should be quite so kind and decent to each other
at first glance it seems to go against the dog eat dog UNknown of UNknown
to be sure UNknown was softened because it was in the selfish interests of genes to build UNknown animals
there are good genetic reasons for limited acts of kindness
but i can 't help wondering is this enough to explain the kindness of humans or even UNknown ?
the dutch UNknown UNknown de UNknown
has been a critic of the selfish gene idea
he believes that our closest living relatives
exhibit empathy and moral concern
that goes beyond the kin UNknown and UNknown for tat of selfish genes
let 's say there 's a big fight someone loses the fight very often another one will put an arm round them try to calm them down groom them
we call that consolation behaviour and that 's common enough that you can collect data on it
de UNknown has accused my work of promoting what he 's UNknown UNknown theory the idea that morals are a thin UNknown
on top of the UNknown UNknown of our animal nature
well the reason i speak of UNknown theory is because we UNknown e seen 30 years of books published on how humans are not UNknown kind
humans are deep down nasty and if we are kind it 's only to make a good impression on each other
and if we are moral it 's just a little UNknown over human nature
i take opposition to that
my feeling is that the phenomena that we see which you UNknown e described as UNknown are phenomena which need explaining
and we 'r e going to explain them in my case in terms of selfish genes
selfish genes are just as good at explaining UNknown behaviour as they are at explaining selfish behaviour
there 's no reason to help the poor because the poor need to help themselves and if they cannot they perish and that 's fine
i hate social UNknown too
but that doesn 't mean we should UNknown nature
or not face facts when it comes to the genetic roots of UNknown
i think UNknown has been UNknown
by kin selection in small groups in nature
but when it comes to humans something special is going on
we UNknown e gone beyond kin selection
our world now has been UNknown up
we live amongst large anonymous UNknown of strangers not kin who share our genes and not people who we might expect to return favours
and yet we still have a lust to be nice
the rule that 's built into your brain says be nice to everyone you meet
and that works in nature because everyone you meet is part of the small group
everyone you meet is probably going to be a cousin
so when i see another human being in distress weeping or something like that
i have an almost UNknown urge to go and console to maybe put my arm around them
what 's the matter ?
how can i help ?
um please let me help you
this person who 's weeping is a complete stranger to me
they will never UNknown and yet the lust is still there
i can 't help it
she got it last time
why are humans often so good to complete strangers ?
could it be because our selfish genes are in some sense a blessed sense UNknown ?
compare it to sexual desire
this for me is the antidote to the darkness some have seen in our UNknown heritage
the joy of being conscious human beings is that we rise above our UNknown
our UNknown selfish genes mean we don 't ape the UNknown of nature but extract ourselves from it and live by our values
as darwin recognised we humans are the first and only species able to escape the brutal force that created us natural selection
we civilised men do our utmost to check the process of elimination
we build UNknown for the imbecile the UNknown and the sick
we institute poor laws and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment
this is the 999 club in london 's east end
it takes in the less fortunate UNknown drug addicts and the homeless providing them with tea and hot meals
such UNknown is i believe among the UNknown of human civilisation
we care for the most vulnerable in our society
we look after the sick we give welfare to the needy
i feel which i UNknown e always felt that they need something hot to warm UNknown m up
when they UNknown e been out all night sleeping and they UNknown e got no warmth in their bodies
if they only have a cup of soup
if they 'r e hungry i UNknown l feed UNknown m
you felt hungry as a child so you felt you didn 't want that to happen to others
that 's how i felt
we can imagine how it is for others
a society run on crude UNknown lines would be a ruthless merciless place
fortunately natural selection gave us big brains
with those big brains we can plan a UNknown society the sort of society in which we would want to live
there 's no benevolence there no forward planning
some people find that disturbing but there is a better way to think about it
we alone on earth have evolved to the extraordinary point where we can understand the selfish genes that shaped us
they 'r e not models for how to behave but the opposite
because we are conscious of these forces we can work towards UNknown them
through kindness and morality modern medicine charity even paying our taxes we can overthrow the tyranny of natural selection
our evolved brains UNknown us to rebel against our selfish genes
next time into the lion 's den today 's religious UNknown against darwin
the ever more elaborate UNknown to deny the evidence of evolution and how darwin himself struggled with the UNknown of his own theory
charles darwin turned our world upside down
his theory of evolution by natural selection is one of the most profound and far reaching ideas in human history
it 's also alas one of the most UNknown
science now has the evidence that proves evolution is true
yet today incredibly the opposition to darwin is more UNknown vocal than ever denying plain facts in more and more elaborate ways
you haven 't seen it and i haven 't seen it so please stop calling it science !
if we had gone from slime to human beings there 'd be an overwhelming amount of evidence
you are a teacher of science and you think that the earth is less than 10 000 years old ?
in this programme the increasingly aggressive UNknown
right now your destiny is all UNknown up
the battles that i think really matter
we can 't get into the business of knocking down kids religions and the religions of families
because and how the first man to understand evolution himself UNknown with religious faith
for darwin the problem was close to home his beloved wife was a UNknown christian
today we have public battles as we confront the ranks of religious UNknown eager to attack darwin 's great legacy which they just don 't understand
when i was a young boy i looked to god to explain life
and then i was introduced to darwin and evolution by my father
at first i didn 't get it
it didn 't seem possible to me that something so simple could explain so much
but then i learnt thought about it a bit more and then suddenly the penny dropped
this incredibly simple theory really was capable of explaining everything about life the beauty the UNknown the UNknown
then i thought well if science can explain something
so apparently inexplicable as life
who knows what the limits might be
on what science could explain more generally
without any UNknown to the supernatural ?
at that moment i became an atheist and i UNknown e never looked back
charles darwin too changed his mind about this biggest of questions
as a young man during his voyage on the beagle
darwin still believed that god had created the world and everything in it
but then he came across more and more evidence that showed that life must have evolved
fossil ancestors patterns of UNknown resemblance startling UNknown in UNknown and the power of domestic breeding all showed that life forms had changed over time
darwin believed there was an entirely natural explanation
all animals vary and in the competition of nature some variations are more successful and more likely to reproduce than others passing their variation on
here in his study at down house
darwin UNknown that the religious story of creation ran against the evidence of the natural world
with evolution god just wasn 't part of the picture
but there was a problem for darwin
his wife emma was religious and the trouble began soon after they got married in UNknown
emma wrote him a letter describing her deep faith
but darwin was no longer convinced there was a god
he UNknown over the letter and UNknown on it
when i am dead know that many times
i have kissed and cried over this
darwin never UNknown religion directly in public
i think he didn 't want to hurt his wife 's feelings
instead he let his science do the talking
he predicted science would bring about a UNknown UNknown of minds
yet sadly today it seems harder and harder for people to see the light
here in the 21st century people are retreating from reason trying to turn back the clock to a world before darwin
UNknown chapter one says everything that god made was very ?
none of you think kill or be killed survival of the UNknown nature red in tooth and claw is good
is the world really 6 000 years old ?
d UNknown ou realise up till noah 's day people lived to be nearly a thousand ?
you don 't die because you get old you die because you 'r e a sinner
up till noah 's day there 's no record of rain
the australian john mackay is a celebrity among UNknown christians
he believes in the UNknown truth of the bible 's creation story and attacks evolution on the very UNknown level
i didn 't grow up UNknown with this
it 's the result of finishing my university course
if evolution is true why can 't we see it happening ?
third year UNknown question to the professor
you take that seriously ?
i took even more seriously when he said
it happens so slowly you wouldn 't expect to see it happening
all of a sudden i thought hang on !
in other words what you don 't see happening is not science it 's UNknown and you were the first person to admit it on UNknown
you 'r e using the word see as meaning see within one lifetime
if a phenomenon takes millions of years of course you won 't see it
which means you have a faith position
it does not mean and you need to admit it as you weren 't there
it means you use other evidence than the evidence of one man 's eyes
oh sorry darwin was only UNknown
that 's only 150 years ago almost right ?
and you haven 't seen it and i haven 't seen it so please stop calling it science
call what you 'r e teaching philosophy or UNknown if you 'r e gonna really be honest and my time is up
that 's ridiculous but anyway
thank you very much and bye
the refusal to believe in anything you can 't see yourself is absurd
i never saw napoleon with my own eyes but that doesn 't mean napoleon didn 't exist
john mackay can 't see a cell or an atom
or weather systems on the other side of the world
does that mean they don 't exist ?
darwin didn 't just trust his own eyes
he checked his theory against evidence gathered through extensive correspondence with UNknown across the world
mackay it seems to me UNknown science at a deep level
science is precisely not limited by what we can see with our own eyes in one lifetime
the whole wonderful UNknown of science
is to investigate phenomena beyond human experience
from far off UNknown to UNknown bacteria from far off UNknown to UNknown bacteria
UNknown 's next best strategy is not flat denial
but to claim there is evidence against evolution
and that a genuine debate is yet to be had
this is the UNknown favourite claim in america
where the battle between faith and science really UNknown
charles darwin 's struggle with religion was private
today the battle has become public
in my lifetime opposition to evolution has grown
particularly in the united states
50 years ago the soviet union launched UNknown and the space race began
in response the americans made science priority number one
the government poured money into science education
for the first time evolution was taught in every classroom in america
but the religious UNknown hit back
tell me joe how does he explain away god ?
well why don 't you come to the science club meeting ?
to defend their bible against the UNknown
a bizarre UNknown of scientific language and religious UNknown
that they UNknown as a real alternative to evolution
our eyes are amazing little instruments
but they 'r e only one part of the wondrous body that god has given us
i worry that this is UNknown not science
my book the god delusion has put me firmly in the front line
in the battle between religion and reason
i 'm one of your biggest fans
can i speak to the number one british intellectual ?
i UNknown e read all your books
the most powerful nation on earth is UNknown
at this conference of UNknown i 'm treated almost like a rock star
but there are sections of american society
that would happily lynch me
are you religious at all ?
i mean do you pray ?
you 'r e not religious at all ?
do i look religious ?
i hope you die slowly and you UNknown burn in hell
and you should realise that your entire life has been a delusion
and that right now your destiny is all UNknown up
you sir are an absolute ass
your UNknown intelligence is nothing more
satan will enjoy torturing you
her created all of us
the only one who is blinded are the UNknown and stubborn
everything darwin said is wrong and evolution has never been proven
and nothing is UNknown now
the bible is the best book
nothing even comes close to its accuracy
and if you think god 's judgment is bad
the devil has worse in store for all UNknown
no UNknown at all in that one
it doesn 't scare me
i mean i rather pity these people
they react in a way that sounds defensive and actually really rather pathetic
ha ha you UNknown dumb ass
but there 's also an entirely different kind of opposition
slick in style and with a more polished line of attack
wendy wright is president of concerned women for america
she represents half a million UNknown women
i 'm here to see wendy wright
i UNknown l take you right in
i worry that her organisation
would condemn american children to ignorance
by attacking sound scientific evidence
why is it so important to you that people not believe in a creator ?
that 's not the point
the point is that as a scientist
i 'm concerned that children in american schools and in schools elsewhere should be exposed to the evidence and allowed to make up their minds about the evidence
so it 's actually us who are arguing for teaching all the evidence not just the ones that are UNknown to UNknown
you could say which UNknown ? i mean
sounds wonderful doesn 't it ?
and it would be if it was a UNknown
between equally valid points of view
i doubt if wendy wright would teach the UNknown
about the earth being flat
because the evidence for the earth being a sphere is so massive
there 's also massive evidence in favour of evolution
but she doesn 't seem to want to know about it
there 's a massive amount of evidence
i 'm sorry but you people keep repeating that like a kind of UNknown
because you just listen to each other
i mean if only you would just open your eyes and look at the evidence
show me the carcass show me the evidence of the in between stage from one species to another
go and look at some modern UNknown UNknown talk to some modern UNknown
look at that evidence it 's beautiful
the evidence for the transition between the UNknown jaw and the UNknown jaw
the UNknown jaw has several bones the UNknown lower jaw has only one bone and the other bones that were in the reptile have now moved into the inner ear
it 's a beautiful transition
there are so many beautiful stories
so is there evidence for evolution or isn 't there ?
i UNknown l begin with fossils
there are now literally millions of fossils
in museums all over the world
they UNknown e been dated and UNknown
and the relationships between them analysed
when UNknown out through time
the UNknown connections can only be explained by evolution
all life is related in a vast family tree
fossils also show how life forms change over time along individual branches of the tree
but there 's even more convincing evidence
today machines like these can UNknown and compare dna with absolute precision
so darwin 's theory can be tested
the results match the fossils
dna links all life through the code and the more closely related two species are physically the more similar their code
this is just part of the mountain of evidence that supports evolution
some religious people just don 't know enough about it
and their strategy is even more bizarre
they see god 's infallible hand in everything
well the evidence that we have is the same for both of us
whereas you might see fossils as evidence for evolution
i might say this is evidence for a worldwide flood
would you want someone like this
teaching your children science in britain in UNknown ?
this is nick UNknown chemistry teacher
at a well respected northern grammar school
and he uses american UNknown material
in his general studies class
it 's so elegant and you as a scientist would appreciate it if only you could remove your UNknown and look at it as a scientist should
how old do you think the world is by the way ?
you are a teacher of science in a major british school and you think that the earth is less than 10 000 years old
i would rather believe god who was there who 's told us than scientists who are UNknown who don 't know the past who weren 't there
and again all i 'm doing is
this is a classic old chestnut
god is infallible therefore the bible is right
it 's as if i claimed darwin was infallible
so what he said was always right
luckily scientists don 't work that way
we sustain our ideas not through sacred UNknown
but through reason and evidence
and again all i 'm doing is bringing healthy debate into the science lesson
if there is a god his word must be more important than the work of UNknown human scientists
i 'm all in favour of teaching children to think for themselves and to question for themselves that 's great
but there are limits to that and i think that when the evidence is so massive you owe it to the children to teach them what the evidence is
what UNknown like nick UNknown claim is god 's perfect creation is in fact the result of evolution 's arms race
animals have evolved extraordinary UNknown to fit their environment but they 'r e not perfect
UNknown can go back to the drawing board
evolution is condemned to UNknown what 's already there
so nature is full of UNknown and UNknown
UNknown also ask how something so apparently perfect as the eye just sprang into existence
the basic chemistry that makes up a light sensitive cell is shared right across the animal kingdom and natural selection has seized on this time and time again
science has uncovered species at every stage in the evolution of the eye
it is a UNknown process and each step of the way is more useful than the one before
no sensible person would have ever left the body the way it is
what 's a good example of that ?
the most dramatic is is the human eye
you know it 's held up as this example of perfection in the body
it 's not perfect !
it 's the perfect example of of why the body is not designed
cover one eye if you would please
and we take the pin and we move it right
now we UNknown l move it out a bit about 15 degrees and right about there
our bodies are so fabulous in some respects
so our UNknown compromised bodies
are themselves evidence of evolution
they 'r e shot through with history
it 's UNknown by science to the same degree napoleon is by history
some things are just true they 'r e not a matter of choice or opinion
but you 'd never guess that in the place
where this matters more than anywhere in our schools
where the teaching of evolution
has become a UNknown sensitive issue for science teachers
this is UNknown britain and one of its fault lines runs straight through our children 's UNknown
how do we reconcile scientific truth with the deeply held convictions that bind religious UNknown ?
charles darwin was the first person to grasp the extraordinary idea that life on earth had evolved without the intervention of any god
and i UNknown e always been intrigued by how he himself UNknown with what that meant for religion
darwin was deeply worried about how religion spread not through reason and evidence but by being UNknown in children 's minds at a young age at school
he wrote that it would become
as difficult for them to throw off their belief in god
as for a monkey to throw off its UNknown fear and hatred of a snake
darwin became concerned by what he saw as the stupid classical education at UNknown school UNknown his eldest son william 's once lively mind
so he was prepared to brave the UNknown of victorian society to send his four other sons to the less UNknown UNknown grammar school because it had strong science education
150 years later darwin would find reason to be equally anxious about what his children were being taught at school
the compromised values of UNknown britain mean that teachers hesitate to offend the religious beliefs of their pupils even when these directly contradict scientific fact
earlier in the series i took a science class from park high school in north london fossil hunting
i was amazed by their lack of knowledge and understanding of evolution
so what do their science teachers have to say about this ?
i worry they 'r e UNknown too respectfully around traditional beliefs
some kids just won 't accept it
you know they 'r e brought up in families where they just don 't believe it and that 's an end to it
there 's no lack of understanding of it necessarily it 's just you know we can 't get into the business of knocking down kids religions and religions of families
why why not actually ?
because we because we teach science and
i would not feel comfortable talking about anything but science so if i present the scientific case and i make sure they understand the scientific case
i think i UNknown e done my job but their acceptance of it is a separate issue
would it be too unfair to suggest
that these well meaning teachers are running scared ?
who could blame them ?
obviously what we believe is affected by our upbringing
but that doesn 't mean we can 't change our minds
we all have the right to see the evidence and re evaluate our beliefs
these science teachers shouldn 't be afraid
to spell out the scientific truth derived from evidence
i don 't see that we can expect to convince them just by showing them the evidence really ?
to them it 's evidence though isn 't it ?
we 'r e talking about something very fundamental
we 'r e talking about young people and identity
it 's not our place to to to fly the banner of science and say there 's no room for anything else
all we can do is present this is a way of thinking this is
science has given us so much
this is one way of UNknown life
we believe this is just one way of UNknown ?
we believe this is the way because we are scientists but it 's not my place to tell you that you 'r e wrong
we believe it because we 'r e scientists ?
do you mean that or that we believe it because the evidence is in the rocks ?
that 's what i 'm saying because i 'm a scientist and that 's the way i view the world
no it 's not because you 'r e a scientist is it ?
their evidence is not there
it 's just made up
you don 't believe that the earth is round only if you 'r e an UNknown
you don 't believe napoleon existed only if you 'r e a historian
you believe these things because they 'r e facts proved by evidence
evolution is also a demonstrated fact
the truth really is out there
it 's not a matter of opinion
UNknown the quaint notion that there are many truths all equally deserving of respect even if they contradict each other is UNknown today
it sounds like a respectful gesture towards UNknown
actually it 's a pretentious cop out
planes fly magic carpets and UNknown don 't
gravity 's not a version of the truth it is the truth
anybody who doubts it is invited to jump out of a tenth floor window
you don 't decide whether to believe it or not believe it on the basis of whim or culture
evolution is the plain truth
where has all this UNknown come from ?
well it started right back in the 19th century in darwin 's time
rather than just denying the evidence
the church of england developed the most sophisticated strategy
to face the challenge of evolution
it saw evolution as one truth within a bigger one and embraced darwin in what one might call a comfortable UNknown fudge
science would explain the workings of nature and god could take the credit for getting science started in the first place
it 's a subtle argument put forward by the most powerful christians in the world
let 's take it on in its modern guise
UNknown as a theory of how evolution works a highly plausible highly UNknown theory about biological history
i don 't have a problem with that
do you see god as having any role in the UNknown process ?
for me god is is the power or the intelligence that shapes the whole of that process
as creator god 's act is the beginning of all creation
by setting up the laws of physics in the first place in which UNknown evolution takes place
i think that 's a slightly different question
UNknown UNknown ut there 's a problem for the church of england
isn 't it trying to have its cake and eat it too ?
trying to have both god and the laws of science
means that one or the other is compromised
either god can 't interfere and has no impact
or if he does get involved it can 't be squared with science
you do believe in some of the new testament miracles
i mean such as the virgin birth
i mean the raising of lazarus ?
i think if you start with a picture of god outside messing around with the works you are in danger of getting into the UNknown tricks model
i think that there are certain moments when there is an opening in the world in which the UNknown divine action comes through in a fresh way
i 'm not sure what that means
it sounds awfully like UNknown
i realise that there are ways of talking about that which do simply sound like god interrupting things
i of course love poetic language but there comes a time when you worry people will misunderstand it as
it 's true or not yes
it 's true or not
i don 't think you can UNknown out of that by doing poetry much as i love poetry
and in a sense they 'r e opening the door letting in the UNknown UNknown by making it respectable to believe things on the basis of faith rather than evidence
now we UNknown e gone through the range of UNknown by which religion tries to deal with darwin
i think they all UNknown
but even i can see why religion puts up this resistance
i get letters from readers who have understood the truth of evolution
but somehow wish they hadn 't
UNknown can be UNknown even frightening
darwin himself was shocked by what he called the low and horribly cruel behaviour he observed in nature
and yet it was UNknown to natural selection
one piece of research shook darwin to his core
so the victim may be aware of being slowly eaten away from inside but unable to move a muscle to do anything about it
how do we face this deeply disturbing truth ?
duck under a security blanket of faith in god ?
but then darwin wondered what kind of god would create an animal that can only exist in this horrible way ?
isn 't it better to embrace reality bleak as it sometimes may be than to avoid it and live a lie ?
in the teeth of life 's hardships darwin was determined to live UNknown
he hadn 't just observed suffering as a scientist he experienced it himself in his own life
darwin had always had a particularly strong bond with his eldest daughter annie
he was charmed by her make believe worlds and her neat little UNknown while she liked to smooth his hair and pat his clothes into shape
but at just ten years old she suffered a painful UNknown death following a bout of scarlet fever
we have lost the joy of the household and the solace of our old age
his UNknown wife emma told the other children that annie had gone to heaven
to UNknown our minds and to look forward with hope to a future state
darwin by contrast could find no meaning or religious consolation as he faced the desperation of UNknown
after the initial period of mourning he and emma scarcely spoke of annie but they never forgot her
religion became a source of tension between them
finally i think the tension had to spill out
in his UNknown darwin wrote an UNknown in which he revealed his anger at what he called the UNknown false bible story
and he added i can indeed hardly see
how anyone ought to wish christianity to be true
for if so the plain language of the text
seems to show that the men who do not believe
and this would include my father brother and almost all my best friends
and this is a UNknown UNknown
though his UNknown was written for his family
darwin must have known it would be published after his death
and he UNknown the opportunity to finally say in public what he had long struggled with in private
but if UNknown UNknown the religious delusion what can go in its place ?
how did darwin himself find consolation in a godless universe ?
religious people attack darwin for in their view draining some of the wonder out of our world for the UNknown of his vision of nature
when its whole significance UNknown on you
your heart sinks into a heap of sand within you
there is a hideous UNknown about it
a ghastly and UNknown reduction of beauty and intelligence
of strength and purpose of honour and UNknown
it really does make everything fall into place and make sense and i find great consolation great happiness in that level of understanding
just ponder for a moment darwin 's central idea the tree of all life now verified as fact by our UNknown dna
it means we are related to every living thing on the planet
and what 's more we are descended from ancestors who were winners UNknown in any way possible to survive and pass on their genes
you and i and every living creature can make the following proud claim
not a single one of my ancestors died young not a single one of my ancestors failed to UNknown
plenty of other individuals died young and failed to UNknown but they didn 't become ancestors
it 's UNknown obvious but from it much follows
it means that every single living creature has inherited the genes of an UNknown line of successful ancestors
that in essence is UNknown
darwin had to bury two more of his children in his lifetime
another daughter and a son died in early UNknown
in memory of mary eleanor
darwin confronted grief in his own way
he found solace i think in the very earth
in which he had to bury his children
for his last book he turned to UNknown
darwin was fascinated by how little by little over huge lengths of time their slow turning of the soil UNknown the whole surface of the earth
nature 's UNknown had their own extraordinary underground economy a damp dark life and death struggle to which we humans were totally UNknown
i doubt darwin wrote whether there are many other animals
which had played so important a part in the history of the world
darwin didn 't wallow in man made notions of the supernatural or an UNknown
his down to earth wonder at nature was his cure for loss of faith
i 'm going to visit someone with a similar outlook the philosopher dan UNknown
i UNknown e known him for 25 years
we 'r e the same age but i think of him as a kind of intellectual elder brother
but recently he had a brush with UNknown
there was a terrible crisis with his heart and his friends were all told that he was going to die
dan has no shred of faith in god or eternity
does he think his UNknown would deny people comfort ?
i think it only UNknown a crutch that they don 't need
and that 's the crutch of an absolute immortal soul
that 's an idea that a lot of people think is very important
the amazing thing is that if you put enough of them together in the right sort of teams you have basically a soul
you have the the control system and the memory of a being that can be held responsible that can hold himself or herself responsible that can look into the future
and when people say where do you get your consolation from ?
just to look just at our planet the UNknown of the life UNknown going on around us all of the UNknown that is there is is just stunning
charles darwin died in UNknown
i 'm not in the least afraid to die he whispered to his wife emma in his last days
darwin had wanted to be buried in down next to his two dead children
in the event however the scientific establishment insisted on the UNknown of burial in westminster abbey
a host of scientists philosophers and celebrities attended on the day
in true c of e style the church attempted to absorb the man who had brought down the house
yet even so the archbishop of canterbury turned out to be indisposed and god fearing prime minister william gladstone pleaded prior engagements
perhaps not for them the funeral of the scientist whose work more than any other has proved the biblical creation story shallow and wanting
he made sense of life
the world is amazing even more amazing than darwin knew and the more we discover
the more petty our little private beliefs seem
rather it opens our minds to a world of majesty the real magic all around us
not based on uncertain faith but sound science
in this handful of soil there are about 25 billion bacteria
that 's four times the entire human population of the planet
we humans and the animals we can actually see are a tiny fraction of life on earth
in the perspective of the universe the UNknown of the universe and of UNknown time we are insignificant
some people find that thought disturbing even frightening
like darwin i find the reality thrilling
back with me ? !
you 'r e about 3 years late then my friend
your honeymoon dragged on a bit long
and you have a ticket to stockholm in your pocket
back in russia on a business trip ?
how do you know ?
i saw the door plate
with you by the way
because one can 't live like we do
you 'r e a UNknown i 'm a god knows what
the founding father dr UNknown
i 'm in good company
there 's a grand foreign term UNknown
remind you of anything ?
you 'r e a curious guy peter
wasn 't it you who ditched us like a whore ?
what piece of good luck !
the UNknown of soviet science
so cut out the swagger now
as if you stepped out for 5 minutes
i don 't play these games
how much does this thing cost over there ?
starring UNknown d UNknown UNknown
written by UNknown UNknown and UNknown UNknown
UNknown what 's he saying ?
UNknown is world 's best player
a talent finding its full expression
he 's an era in hockey
a master an UNknown for millions
achieved everything a veteran still only 31
what did i say ? !
the puck is UNknown in the goal and who put it there ?
where are you going ?
and what about him ?
he also said i look better
i am not taking too much of your time ?
no i have library day today
i just didn 't get anything over the phone
i am not at my best in the mornings
so what 's the matter with peter ?
he just took off and ran away
you can 't imagine the UNknown at the embassy
i tried to explain make excuses
ok damn that sweden it 's a stupid job there 's the UNknown
but he 's a grown up person he made that choice himself
and he doesn 't care
he meets us in moscow with flowers smiling
i came near to killing him
just don 't play the innocent !
he 'd been in moscow before making off
what did you say to him ?
he came back and everything went haywire
UNknown i had nothing to do with it
you must have forgotten me
or you never knew me
do i look like a person who could lead somebody astray ?
i am too lazy for that
what 's he going to do ?
he sits on the windowsill and sings all day
you know what he did the other day ?
nothing UNknown social i hope ?
you 'r e mocking me
i always thought you very unreliable unlike peter
why not talk some more about me ?
why couldn 't you finish the work yourself ?
the idea was there peter wasn 't
and me you know i 'm unreliable
and not irresponsible enough to be a genius
it 's just the geniuses who can make anything work
i understand he let you down terribly
maybe one day peter will leave the windowsill
and his talent will make up for time lost
me i even forgot what it was about
but that 's another story
i don 't know about the windowsill but he is already jumping from bridges
the one in silver wood
there could have been logs underwater
how do you like that ?
seems i am present at a major confession of love
i know you for ages
and it 's no kind of date and yet i was nervous
we 'r e getting older
talk to the people in the UNknown
peter 's there he has an appointment at UNknown
talk him into something anything
we can 't live like that
nobody will decide anything for him
so he made a show pulling out
the main thing is what 's behind it ?
and there 's nothing UNknown
you have to pay for everything
like UNknown us then and taking off
and how are you going to pay ?
you took off too a bit later
the 5th department 's here
i wonder if you know the feeling of waking up in a city that 's utterly foreign to you
and the whole meaningless day can already be imagined with all its faces meetings conversations that make you want to never open your eyes
the heart is heavy as if something were wrong
so that neither your wife the person who is closest to you
when do they go out ?
so that neither your wife the person who is closest to you nor your daughter whom you love most even though she 's not yours can bring you joy
you know you have to pull yourself together go to work pester healthy and busy people with medical check ups and convince yourself that this is also important
and so every day you feel tension
like you were acting somebody 's part instead of living
morning till night until you can take the sleeping pill and drop like into a void
hey sasha how 's life ?
thank you your interest is very touching
but it 's a difficult question
it could be considered personally business wise on a social scale where would you like to start ?
what interests you most ?
born this day ernest rutherford
how should i know ?
my dear it would be so easy for you
that the score 's 2 1
he 's out of this rat race and thank god
can 't a man stop for a moment think about himself ?
isn 't he allowed even that little ?
i 'm confused by my own lies
by the way i think in this whole business you are more worried about yourself eh ?
may i have some ?
and you know how boring it is
3 UNknown is your budget
what if i run away ?
well you UNknown e been warned
must be the wrong coach
where 's the change ?
three UNknown of equipment !
he 's crazy grab him !
would you like an apple ?
UNknown let me steer !
boss let me steer !
this is right this is left this is straight ahead
where have you been hiding ?
the UNknown 's very becoming
what are you smiling about ?
all wishes come true on wednesdays
why didn 't you tell me earlier ?
the day was such a UNknown i wouldn 't have worried
but now we have ahead of us an afternoon of miracles and unlimited opportunities
UNknown look who 's here !
gone for 2 days and they 'r e all shameless
grab her the pace maker !
who 's grabbing whom ?
peter can you come tonight ?
i feel tight here put me on sick list !
you should give birth to UNknown
peter i dreamt i lost a tooth what 's that mean ?
let the whole country ponder this
get off that 's enough
she has a husband !
now for a surprise !
would anybody like a ride on a wild arabian stallion ?
well you brave men UNknown anyone ?
or else i UNknown l do it !
i see the gentleman in grey is willing
what not a single brave man here ?
where are you going ?
ah so we have a brave one !
will you perform too ?
is he a performer ?
is he on the bill ?
what 's his name ?
look he is facing back !
who rides like that ?
you UNknown l be more comfortable
where are you going ?
everything 's well it 's fine
what do you want from me ?
i can 't take it !
it 's my life !
we haven 't much time
i won 't live anyway
are you the new doctor ?
just now as we flew in we were laughing like mad
listening to UNknown on the radio
at my UNknown in UNknown
i have a good friend a UNknown called UNknown
and he has an awful enemy
this was first published in 1946
people were so happy then the was had just ended
yes you kids weren 't even around yet
scream if you like it helps
i read this from my aunt 's UNknown
i tagged along on the medical train
read this for the wounded soldiers
in the evenings from the harbour
ships are leaving for the distant shores
why did he come ?
did he come for UNknown ?
just don 't say anything
i dreamed it all up
and then i was ashamed to show my face and go to work
such a silly thing to do
i wanted to do it differently
i got up and went out into the UNknown
what to do people everywhere
and everything got so clear
i knew i had nothing to wait for tomorrow or the day after
and i don 't want anything
and it 's like i 'm alone in the world
i 'm afraid of blood i can faint from a blood test
so i found a rope
but where to do it ?
found a large nail behind the barn
got the nail in anyhow made up my mind and then a goat appears from somewhere
how to do it with a goat watching ?
and the dinner call goes
so i throw the rope over the nail and UNknown !
and the nail gave way
so i 'm sitting there with the rope on my neck somebody bangs on a pan calling for dinner
should i go on hanging myself or have dinner first ?
i decided i 'd have dinner and see
why do you make me say all this why ?
what do i want to know for ?
i UNknown l say nothing more you can go to hell
you know i also used to think it was all or nothing in life
but it can 't be that nobody cares
somebody needs you and me
while you feel you live
i UNknown l fry some eggs
i UNknown l do it
it 's a muddled day right ?
does it trouble you very much ?
i was never so close to leaving him
you know all this sweden is on my conscience
my divorce custody battle people offering advice
i asked him one thing to take me away
and the swedish job UNknown up right then
and now i 'm losing him and myself
three empty years feeling i 'd betrayed him
UNknown you 'r e an intelligent girl
do you seriously think women decide everything ?
ask peter why he did it
he wouldn 't be able to explain
and it 's a very common case
i 'm saying this as a doctor
you feel you have talent
my talent is always with me
it will serve me regardless
and you never think you can just lose it
then one fine day you panic what am i doing ?
you break up with everything punch your way out
youthful actions in mature age
we UNknown e been left behind UNknown
do you think we UNknown e missed our chances ?
i won 't shout about it in the streets anyway
a girl i know told me
you 'r e older and more boring than my father
ask me where it doesn 't
we UNknown l operate on you gran
who else is there ?
get out of there !
i UNknown l send you the spoon x ray
are her UNknown ready ?
i UNknown l show you later
what are you going to do ?
nobody does things like this
the frost bite case remember ?
we take 2 days off thursday plus the weekend
we meet at UNknown at the hostel and take off
your gun in order this time ?
ah ! don 't forget the alcohol !
that 's where you start !
that 's where we UNknown l finish
did you hear there 's beer at the canteen
i have pickles drop by
is there more beer ?
that 's for the whole UNknown ?
don 't you know me ?
shall i sock him ?
hold it hold it !
so you do know me
what are you doing !
what if they really sock me not knowing that we 'r e acquainted that you just forgot to say hello
i 'm very glad that you 'r e all right
one more question may i ?
who else would you marry ?
a talent finding its full expression in removing UNknown
didn 't i save you ?
you want to keep saving me all my life ?
well there 's no more need !
look inside yourself for once
forgive me do you hear ?
i remember the first fight
first time i was a coward
but today for the first time i couldn 't lie
every such lie has a justification otherwise you couldn 't live
but today a common regular lie and i couldn 't
i turned to her as in a dream
you 'r e my justification
a small one but still
you kill one you save one
but i started with myself 3 years ago
stop it never say that !
you mustn 't say that
your line of fate crosses the line of ability
what are you UNknown about for ?
translated by UNknown for kg
the stated goal of the soviets is global communism
in medicine or economics in technology or space battle lines are being drawn
to triumph we need results UNknown UNknown results
now who among you will be the next morse ?
who among you will be the vanguard of democracy freedom and discovery ?
today we bequeath america 's future into your able hands
it 's not enough hansen won the carnegie scholarship
no he has to have it all for himself
it 's the first time the carnegie prize has been split
rumor is he 's got his sights set on wheeler lab the new military think tank at m i t
they 'r e only taking one this year
hansen 's used to being picked first
oh yeah he 's wasted on math
he should be running for president
UNknown here broke a jap code
helped rid the world of fascism
at least that 's what he tells the girls eh UNknown ?
i UNknown l take another
i simply assumed you were the waiter
it is martin isn 't it ?
why yes john it is
i imagine you 'r e getting quite used to UNknown
gentlemen meet john nash the mysterious west virginia genius
did you know that having a hangover is is not having enough water in your body to run your UNknown UNknown ?
which is exactly what happens to you when you 'r e dying of thirst
so dying of thirst would probably feel pretty much like the hangover that finally bloody kills you
i 'm almost human again
officer i saw the driver who hit me
well i got in last night in time for
cock was mine the tail belonged to a particularly lovely young thing with a passion for
you 'r e not easily distracted are you ?
i 'm here to work
if we can 't break the ice how about we drown it ?
so what 's your story ?
you the poor kid that never got to go to exeter or UNknown ?
i 'm actually quite well balanced
i have a chip on both shoulders
maybe you 'r e just better with the old UNknown than you are with people
the truth is that l
i don 't like people much
and they don 't much like me
mathematics is never going to lead you to a higher truth
and you know why ?
you know half these UNknown are already published ?
i cannot waste time with these classes and these books
UNknown the weaker UNknown of lesser mortals !
i need to look through to the UNknown UNknown
find a truly original idea
that 's the only way i UNknown l ever distinguish myself
all right who 's next ?
i i hate this game
cowards all of you !
none of you rise to meet my challenge ?
sol does his laundry all semester
does that seem unfair to anyone else ?
taking a reverse constitutional ?
hey nash i thought you dropped out
you ever going to go to class or
classes will dull your mind
destroy the potential for authentic UNknown
oh oh i didn 't know that
nash is going to UNknown us all with his genius
which is another way of saying he doesn 't have the nerve to compete
let me ask you something john
bender and sol here correctly completed
allen 's proof of UNknown 's UNknown
i 'm a patient man martin
is there an actual question coming ?
how will it feel when i 'm chosen for wheeler and you 'r e not ?
what if you lose ?
i had the first move my my play was perfect
the UNknown of the defeated
gentlemen the great john nash
you UNknown e been in here for two days
you know hansen 's just published another paper ?
i can 't even find a topic for my UNknown
well on the bright side you UNknown e invented window art
this is a group playing touch football
this is a UNknown of pigeons fighting over bread crumbs
and this here is a woman who is chasing a man who stole her purse
john you watched a UNknown
in competitive behavior someone always loses
when did you last eat ?
when did you last eat ? currency exchange ?
now pizza i have enormous respect for
i have respect for beer
i have respect for beer !
good evening UNknown hey nash
UNknown is trying to get your attention
gentlemen might i remind you that my odds of success dramatically improve with each attempt
this is going to be classic
maybe you want to buy me a drink
i don 't exactly know what i 'm required to say in order for you to have UNknown with me but could we assume that i said all that ?
essentially we 'r e talking about fluid exchange right ?
so could we just go straight to the sex ?
have a nice night asshole !
i especially liked the bit about fluid exchange
i UNknown e been meaning to talk with you
the faculty is completing mid year reviews
that would be my first choice
and actually i don 't really have a second choice sir
john your fellows have attended classes
they UNknown e written papers
i 'm still searching sir for my
your original idea i know
it 's very clever john but i 'm afraid it 's just not nearly good enough
i UNknown e been working on UNknown UNknown
my bargaining UNknown are starting to show some promise
if you could just arrange another meeting if you 'd be kind enough with professor einstein
reserved for a member of the department that makes the achievement of a lifetime
is there a difference ?
john you haven 't focused
and my compliments to you sir
this is all i am
come on let 's go out
i can 't keep staring into space
got to face the wall follow their rules read their books
but don 't mess around do their classes
go on bust that worthless head wide open
what the hell is your problem ? !
it 's not my problem
and it 's not your problem
your answer isn 't face the wall
it 's out there where you UNknown e been working
that isaac newton fellow was right
don 't worry that 's mine
nash you might want to stop UNknown your papers for five seconds
i will not buy you gentlemen beer
does anyone else feel she should be moving in slow motion ?
will she want a large wedding ya think ?
shall we say swords gentlemen ?
have you remembered nothing ?
recall the lessons of adam smith the father of modern economics
every man for himself gentlemen
and those who strike out are stuck with her friends
i 'm not gonna strike out
you can lead a blonde to water but you can 't make her drink
she 's looking over here
he may have the upper hand now but wait until he opens his mouth
remember the last time ?
oh yes that was one for the history books
what are you talking about ?
if we all go for the blonde
not a single one of us is gonna get her
so then we go for her friends but they will all give us the cold shoulder because nobody likes to be second choice
well what if no one goes for the blonde ?
we don 't get in each other 's way and we don 't insult the other girls
that 's the only way we win
that 's the only way we all get laid
adam smith said the best result comes from everyone in the group doing what 's best for himself right ?
because the best result will come from everyone in the group doing what 's best for himself and the group
c of s equals c of t
you do realize this flies in the face of a 1 50 years of economic theory ?
that 's rather presumptuous don 't you think ?
well mr nash with a breakthrough of this magnitude
i 'm confident you will get any UNknown you like
stills and frank are excellent choices
sol and bender are extraordinary UNknown
has it occurred to you that sol and bender might have plans of their own ?
wheeler we made it !
general the analyst from wheeler lab is here
dr nash your coat ?
general this is wheeler team leader dr john nash
we UNknown e been UNknown radio UNknown from moscow
the computer can 't detect a pattern but i 'm sure it 's code
why is that general ?
we UNknown e developed several UNknown
6 7 3 7 0 3 6
9 1 4 0 3 4
46 1 3 08 67 46 90
48 03 01 91 26 35
these are UNknown and UNknown
there are a least 1 0 others
gentlemen we need to move on this
who 's big brother ?
what are the russians moving general ?
dr nash follow me please
none of those who have said they don 't like the method have told us any other method they could use that would be effective
home run at the pentagon ?
the air conditioning broke again
how am i supposed to be in here saving the world if i 'm melting ?
our hearts go out to you
you know two trips to the pentagon in four years
that 's two more than we UNknown e had
you made the cover of fortune again
please note the use of the word you not we
so not only do they rob me of the fields medal now they put me on the cover of fortune magazine with these UNknown these scholars of UNknown
john exactly what 's the difference between genius and most genius ?
anyway you UNknown e got 1 0 minutes
i UNknown e always got 1 0 minutes
before your new class ?
can i not get a note from a doctor or something ?
you are a doctor john and no
now come on you know the drill we get these beautiful facilities
now have a nice day at school
the eager young minds of tomorrow
can we leave one open professor ?
it 's really hot sir
i think this class will be a waste of your and what is infinitely worse my time
so you may attend or not
you may complete your assignments at your whim
um we have a little problem
it 's extremely hot in here with the windows closed and extremely noisy with them open
so i was wondering if there was any way you could
i don 't know maybe work someplace else for about UNknown ?
thank you so much !
clean it up a little bit
as you will find in UNknown UNknown there is often a number of UNknown for any given problem
as i was saying this problem here will take some of you many months to solve
big brother at your service
what can i do for the department of defense ?
are you here to give me a raise ?
let 's take a walk
impressive work at the pentagon
genius sees the answer before the question
his project was under my supervision
it 's not that simple you know ?
well you ended the war
we UNknown 1 50 000 people in a heartbeat
great deeds come at great cost mr UNknown
well conviction it turns out is a luxury of those on the UNknown mr nash
i UNknown l try and keep that in mind
so john no family no close friends
i like to think it 's because i 'm a lone wolf
but mainly it 's because people don 't like me
well there are certain UNknown where your lack of personal connection would be considered an advantage
this is a secure area
have you ever been here ?
we were told during our initial briefing that these warehouses were abandoned
that 's not precisely accurate
by telling you what i 'm about to tell you
i am increasing your security clearance to top secret
UNknown of secure information can result in imprisonment
those are a good idea
this factory is in berlin
we seized it at the end of the war
nazi engineers were attempting to build a portable atomic bomb
the soviets reached this facility before we did and we lost the damn thing
the UNknown orders at the pentagon they were about this weren 't they ?
the soviets aren 't as UNknown as people believe
a UNknown of the red army calling itself UNknown UNknown
the new freedom has control of the bomb and intends to UNknown it on u s soil
their plan is to UNknown maximum civilian casualties
man is capable of as much UNknown as he has imagination
new freedom has sleeper agents here in the u s
mccarthy is an idiot but unfortunately that doesn 't make him wrong
new freedom UNknown to its agents through codes UNknown in newspapers and magazines and that 's where you come in
you see john what UNknown you is that you are quite simply the best natural code breaker i have ever seen
what exactly is it that you would like me to do ?
commit this list of UNknown to memory
scan each new issue find any hidden codes UNknown them
place your chin on the chin rest
okay this may be a little uncomfortable
that 's got a little UNknown to it doesn 't it ?
he just UNknown a radium UNknown
don 't worry it 's safe
as a result these numbers change overtime
they 'r e the access codes to your drop spot
boy you must be really important
it 's all right mike
i suspect that nobody missed me
the problem that you left on the board
oh no you didn 't
you didn 't even look
i never said that the UNknown fields were rational functions
though on this particular occasion ultimately incorrect
you 'r e still here
i 'm wondering professor nash if i can ask you to dinner
you do eat don 't you ?
UNknown alone chained to the rock with the bird circling overhead you know how it is
no i expect that you wouldn 't you wouldn 't know uh
if you leave your address with my office
i UNknown l pick you up friday at 8 00 and we UNknown l eat
do you have a name or should i just keep calling you miss ?
governor may i present miss alicia UNknown
i want a copy of this
first big date and all you know
so you boys need to look good
god must be a painter
why else would we have so many colors ?
so you 'r e a painter ?
practice human UNknown and social UNknown
i UNknown l be outside
i will get the champagne
i believe in deciding things will be good luck
i don 't believe in luck
i once tried to count them all
i actually made it to 4 348
i bet you 'r e very popular with the girls
what would you like ?
you don 't talk much do you ?
i can 't talk to you about my work alicia
i don 't mean work
i find that polishing my UNknown in order to make them sociable requires a tremendous effort
i have a tendency to UNknown information flow by being direct
your aggressive moves towards me indicate that you feel the same way
but still ritual requires that we continue with a number of UNknown activities before we have sex
i am proceeding with those activities but in point of actual fact all i really want to do is have UNknown with you as soon as possible
are you gonna slap me now ?
how was that result ?
what are you doing ?
i 'm attempting to UNknown UNknown UNknown within UNknown over time
you talk funny mr nash
do i know you ?
my uncle says you 'r e very smart but not very nice so i shouldn 't pay no mind if you 'r e mean to me
and who might your uncle be ?
my sister got herself killed in a car crash
not too far now UNknown !
her cowboy husband was too drunk to know that he was too drunk to drive
so i took her in
that 's how they come
i 'm at harvard doing the great author 's workshop
i really do think you should buy yourself a new book
well i UNknown e been reading a lot about you
how are you john ?
at first all my work here was trivial but a new assignment came up and
i can 't really tell you any details
there 's no accounting for taste is there ?
i mean everything 's going well
it all seems to add up
but how do you know for sure ?
nothing 's ever for sure john
alicia please don 't be angry
the UNknown faces of the glass you see they create a full UNknown UNknown so if you look inside it you can see
remember you said that time god must be a painter because of all the colors at the governor 's house ? you said that
i didn 't think you were listening
alicia does our relationship warrant long term commitment ?
cause i need some kind of proof some kind of UNknown UNknown data
i 'm sorry just give me a moment to UNknown my girlish notions of romance
how do you know ?
i know because all the data indicate it
you haven 't seen it
how do you know for sure ?
it 's the same with love i guess
now the part that you don 't know is if i want to marry you
smile for the camera !
they 'r e following us
who 's who 's following us ?
the drop 's been compromised
i ain 't shooting anybody
s sol yeah i talked to sol
he said you left the office hours ago
why didn 't you call me ?
come on open the door !
this is not what i signed on for
every time a car UNknown or a door slams
i understand better than you could possibly imagine
you need to calm down john
we 'r e closing in on the bomb in large part due to your work
now don 't you think your fear is a small price to pay ?
william my circumstance has changed
i told you UNknown were dangerous
you chose to marry the girl
i did nothing to prevent it
the best way to ensure everybody 's safety is for you to continue your work
well i UNknown l just quit
why would i not ?
because i keep the russians from knowing you work for us
you quit working for me
turn off the light !
why would you do that ?
why would you turn the light on ?
what is wrong with you ?
you have to go to your sister 's
i left the car out the back
no side streets you stay where it 's crowded
john i 'm not going anywhere !
when you get to your sister 's you wait for me to call you
no i 'm not going
i 'm not leaving stop !
i UNknown l explain when i can
wow someone needed a hug !
i saw you on the slate and i thought to myself
how can i miss seeing a guest lecture by the UNknown john nash ?
i got myself into something
i think i might need some help
well now you tell me what is it ?
so we see that the the UNknown of the UNknown UNknown function UNknown to UNknown in space time UNknown in space time and conventional number theory
it breaks down in the face of UNknown UNknown
sometimes our expectations are betrayed by the numbers
UNknown are impossible to assign any rational value
let 's avoid a scene shall we ?
what do you want ?
forgive me if i don 't seem persuaded
i 'd like you to come with me john
it appears i have no choice
i know who you are !
i know who you are !
no no no no don 't
charles they 'r e russians !
charles they 'r e russians !
they 'r e russians !
everything 's all right here
can you hear me ?
UNknown takes a little while to wear off
you UNknown e got one hell of a right hook
i find that highly unlikely
my work is non military in application
which work is that john ?
i don 't know anything
i didn 't mean to get you involved in this
saw my name on the lecture slate
you lying son of a bitch !
who are you talking to ?
tell me who you see
how do you say charles herman in russian ?
how do you say it in russian ?
there 's no one there john
there 's no one there
l i don 't know anything !
my name is john nash
i 'm being held against my will
somebody call the department of defense
my name is john nash
i 'm being held against my will !
what 's wrong with him ?
people with this disorder are often paranoid
in john 's world these UNknown are accepted encouraged
as such his illness may have gone UNknown far longer than is typical
what do you mean ?
possibly since graduate school ?
at least that 's when his hallucinations seem to have begun
what are you talking about ?
one so far that i am aware of
an imaginary roommate named charles herman
he and john have been best friends since princeton
have you ever met charles ?
has he ever come to dinner ?
he 's always in town for so little time lecturing
was he at your wedding ?
have you ever seen a picture of him talked to him on the telephone ?
according to their housing records
now which is more likely that your husband a UNknown with no military training is a government spy fleeing the russians
you 'r e making him sound crazy or that he has lost his grip on reality ?
what 's he been working on ?
he mentioned a supervisor by the name of william UNknown
maybe mr UNknown can clarify things for us
but i can 't get to him without UNknown
you want me to help you get the details of my husband 's work ?
john thinks i 'm a russian spy
is that what you think ?
what did the doctor say ?
i want to see what john 's been working on
you know you can 't go in his office
why didn 't you say something ?
alicia john 's always been a little weird
he said he was doing code breaking that it was eyes only
top secret part of the military effort
well it was possible you know ?
UNknown come down all the time that some of us aren 't cleared for
lately he 'd become so much more agitated and then when you called
so is this all he 's been doing every day ?
alicia i UNknown e been thinking about it and i do realize that my behavior and my UNknown to discuss the situation with you must have appeared insane
i left you with no other choice
i do understand and i 'm truly sorry
everything 's gonna be all right
everything 's gonna be all right
we just have to talk quietly
i 'm gonna tell you everything now
it 's breaking with protocol but you need to know because you have to help me get out of here
i UNknown e been doing top secret work for the government
there 's a threat that exists of UNknown proportions
i think the russians feel my profile is too high
that 's why they simply just don 't do away with me
they 'r e keeping me here to try to stop me from doing my work
you have to get to wheeler
there is no william UNknown
i UNknown e been working for him
dropping packages in a secret mailbox for the government to pick up ?
how could you know that ?
he thought it was harmless
they UNknown e never been opened
there is no conspiracy john
there is no william UNknown
it 's in your mind
do you understand baby ?
i can 't find it
you see the nightmare of UNknown is not knowing what 's true
imagine if you had suddenly learned that the people and the places and the moments most important to you were not gone not dead but worse had never been
five times a week for 1 0 weeks
john always spoke so UNknown of being here at princeton
and hansen is running the department now
john won 't come near the campus though
so alicia how how are you holding up ?
well the delusions have passed
they 'r e saying with the medication and low stress environment
no l i mean how are you ?
i think often what i feel is obligation
or guilt over wanting to leave
rage against john against god and
but then i look at him and i force myself to see the man that i married
and he becomes that man
he 's transformed into someone that i love
and i 'm transformed into someone who loves him
it 's not all the time but it 's enough
i hope it 's okay
john there 's no relax it 's okay
there 's no point in being nuts if you can 't have a little fun
i can take those later
you 'r e supposed to take them now
can i bring you something ?
i i was in town giving a workshop
you know bender he really wanted to stop by and you know see you
i suppose i would be too
but alas i 'm stuck with me
i figured if if i dazzle them they will have to UNknown me
but it 's difficult with the medication because it 's hard to see the solution
you know john you should go easy
there are other things besides besides work
what are you thinking about ?
what do people do ?
activities available just add meaning
you could try leaving the house
you know maybe talk to people
you could try taking out the garbage
and there 's some more there 's some more in
garbage men don 't come at night
is it the medication ?
i don 't know what to do
my mother 's going to keep the baby a little longer tonight
i can get three hours of overtime
it 's good to see you john
you 'r e not real !
i don 't think that i would go that way john
it 's time for you to get back to work
the bomb is in its final position here in the u s
knowing your situation requires you keep a low profile mohammed we UNknown e brought the mountain to you
we UNknown e UNknown the bomb 's location to somewhere on the eastern UNknown
but we haven 't been able to pinpoint its exact position
their codes have grown increasingly complex
dr UNknown said UNknown !
UNknown break from reality right ?
do i look like i 'm imagined ?
wheeler has no record of you
do you think we list our personnel ?
john i 'm sorry you had to go through all this
i UNknown e gone to a great deal of trouble to get you back
i can restore your status at wheeler
i can let the world know what you did
but i need you now soldier
i was so scared you weren 't real
there 's a storm coming
i 'm just going to grab the laundry okay ?
i UNknown l draw his bath
i UNknown e almost got it !
charles you just watch the baby
there is no one here
there is no one here !
he 's been injected with a UNknown serum
i can see him because of a chemical that was released into my UNknown when my UNknown dissolved
hello i need dr UNknown 's office please
you UNknown e got to stop her john
you leave her out of this
who are you talking to ?
she UNknown l compromise us again
you UNknown l go back to the hospital
alicia please put the phone down
i can 't let that happen
hi i need dr UNknown
you know what you have to do nash
she 's too great a risk
she knows too much now
alicia and charles never UNknown in the same UNknown field
UNknown can 't be real
why did you stop your UNknown ?
because i couldn 't do my work
i couldn 't help with the baby
i couldn 't respond to my wife
you think that 's better than being crazy ?
there has to be another way
some days maybe symptom free but over time you are getting worse
that 's all it is
it 's a problem with no solution
and that 's what i do i solve problems
that 's what i do best
you can 't come up with a formula to change the way you experience the world
all i have to do is apply my mind
there 's no UNknown no proof
you can 't reason your way out of this
why can 't l ?
because your mind is where the problem is in the first place
i can work it out
all i need is time
is that the baby ?
the baby 's at my mother 's john
without treatment john the fantasies may take over entirely
i can 't go back to that hospital
i won 't come home
he said that if you said that he has commitment papers for me to sign
well maybe you won 't sign them
maybe you UNknown l just give me some time
i will try to figure this out
UNknown is right about one thing
you shouldn 't be here
i 'm not safe anymore
would you have hurt me john ?
maybe you should let dr UNknown drive you to your mother 's
UNknown said to call if you try and kill me or anything
maybe the part that knows the waking from the dream maybe it isn 't here
i don 't have that one
my savior complex takes on a completely different form
i heard what happened and well
i i wanted to write and i tried you at macarthur 's but you 'd left and i just
yeah i stole it from him
seems that you won after all martin
please please have a seat
god it 's so good to see you
john i 'm sorry but you have to tell him
tell him you 'r e a genius
you 'r e a genius john !
tell him your work is critical
is there any chance that you could ignore what i just did ?
of course what are old friends for ?
alicia and i think that that fitting in being part of a community might do me some good
that a certain level of attachment familiar places familiar people might help me elbow out these
these certain delusions that i have
it 's a lot to ask and now that i 'm here
i 'm quite certain that you will just say no
no i could just work out of the library
well this guy tries to wander into the library but he doesn 't have i d
why can 't people read their UNknown huh ?
then he goes totally nuts
you 'r e not real
you are not real !
is this what you are soldier ?
i 'm not a soldier
you 'r e gonna end up in a cell !
and while you rock and drool the world will burn to ashes !
you are not real !
you are not real !
you 'r e still talking to me soldier
there 's no mission !
hey you 'r e all right
nash nash hey hey hey
you should UNknown e seen their faces
everybody was just staring at me
but then on the way home
sometimes i really miss talking to him
john now you can 't ignore me forever
but i won 't talk to you again
i was wondering if i might UNknown your course
it 's it 's an honor professor nash
this will be my first class
good morning eager young minds
it 's never gonna work john
you 'r e just humiliating yourself
i 'm ashamed of you
you 'r e gonna be late
did you just solve UNknown ?
that 's an UNknown to UNknown for UNknown UNknown
i believe i 'm making progress
i UNknown e been studying your UNknown
the one you wrote here at princeton
to come up with something totally original the way you did
i UNknown e been developing a theory
i believe i can prove that UNknown UNknown are covering spaces
that everything everything is connected
that it 's all part of the same subject
when was the last time you ate ?
my wife she loves UNknown
alicia ! coming together at maximum speed of
this is the important thing about actually UNknown in and UNknown the area that you 'r e dealing with
mathematics is very specific and it is an art form no matter what these people around here will tell you especially the people from biology
don 't listen to any of those people
let me go back to what you were doing before
i might want to steal this write a book and get famous
i was thinking that i might teach
a classroom with 50 students can be UNknown for anyone
john besides you 'r e a terrible teacher
i 'm an acquired taste martin
i was hoping there still might be something i could contribute
no they 'r e not gone
and maybe they never will be
but i UNknown e gotten used to ignoring them and i think as a result they UNknown e kind of given up on me
you think that 's what it 's like with all our dreams and our nightmares martin ?
you UNknown e got to keep feeding them for them to stay alive ?
john they haunt you though
they 'r e my past martin
everybody 's haunted by their past
john i UNknown l talk to the department
now you ought best ring alicia or you 'r e gonna get me
papers in hand mr UNknown
forgive me i 'm just always suspicious of new people
see you next week professor
so now that i know that you 'r e real who are you and what can i do for you ?
professor my name is thomas king
mm hm and i 'm here to tell you that you 'r e being considered for the nobel prize
forgive me but i 'm just a little stunned
over the past few years your UNknown has become a UNknown of modern economics
suddenly everybody likes that one
what about my work on other some such projects UNknown UNknown ?
the application of your bargaining problem to UNknown UNknown UNknown or to UNknown cases
have i just reached some level of honesty that borders on stupidity ?
no no you haven 't
cause i wouldn 't have thought of that
shall we have tea ?
oh i don 't go in there
i usually just take my sandwich in the library
let 's have some tea
most UNknown available brands of tea are not suitable to my UNknown
there are some northern indian UNknown which are dense enough
i enjoy the flavor that they have
i have not been in this room for some many years
i wonder what tea they serve
why thank you young lady
things have certainly changed around here
i would have thought the UNknown for the nobel prize would have been secret
i would have thought you 'd only find out if you won or lost
that is generally the case yes
but these are special circumstances
you came here to find out if i was crazy ?
find out if i would screw everything up if i actually won ?
dance around the UNknown strip naked and squawk like a chicken things of this nature ?
would i embarrass you ?
i take the UNknown UNknown
but i still see things that are not here
i just choose not to acknowledge them
like a diet of the mind
i choose not to indulge certain UNknown
like my appetite for patterns
it 's an honor sir
i UNknown e always believed in numbers
in the UNknown and UNknown that lead to reason
but after a lifetime of such UNknown
i ask what truly is logic ?
my quest has taken me through the physical the UNknown the UNknown and back
and i have made the most important discovery of my career
the most important discovery of my life
it is only in the mysterious UNknown of love that any logical reasons can be found
i 'm only here tonight because of you
you are the reason i am
so nice to have met you
are you ready to go now ?
yes indeed and yes please
i have a car outside
are you interested in a ride ?
i UNknown l show you
i will watch through the night
hold you in my arms
i will watch through the dark
transcript made by UNknown with a little help from UNknown

promise you won 't get eddie too UNknown tonight will you ?
fuck it what are you trying to do to me eh ?
i UNknown e got UNknown 's money
the problem is it 's tied up in these cars and you UNknown want to trash the lot of UNknown m
mr UNknown doesn 't care about your inventory
mr UNknown wants to know that he 's getting paid
any day i swear UNknown
what did you call me ?
i called you UNknown UNknown !
everyone calls you UNknown and him UNknown
they 'r e fucking cartoon pigs on the UNknown what people call us that behind our backs ?
well i 'm not gonna say it to your face aren 't i ?
well you just bloody did !
yeah well you got me rolled
don 't make us come back again
not every customer is a satisfied customer
what are you doing here my dear UNknown ?
tonight is eddie 's stag do
i UNknown e got a proposition for you terry
can you meet me at the player 's club before you see the boys ?
and i UNknown l fill you in on the details
summoned by the gods ?
got up to your new mistress this weekend ?
i don 't know what you 'r e talking about i 'm a married man
what do you think am i presentable ?
not sure about the tie darling
too much of that nonsense and we 'r e both out of our job
calls himself michael x in homage to malcolm x his american UNknown
the UNknown socialist press would have us believe this michael x is a UNknown champion of the poor and oppressed
and the black robin hood of UNknown hill
the richer UNknown and more famous they will all fall over him
the truth is he 's a slum landlord a drug dealer and a vicious pimp who should have been in prison years ago
are you not charging outrageous rents to my brothers and sisters mr brown ?
i 'm charging the same as your slum lord friend lew vogel
i always wanted to meet a white man by the name of brown
you know what this is ?
it 's a slave collar
and a white man made my mothers and fathers wear this to bend them to his will
can i bend you to my will mr brown ?
you sure got a faithful dog now michael
michael i don 't think we should get our hopes up here
UNknown UNknown assault on this man brown here as well as your previous problems with the law i mean
you could be looking at 10 to 20 years i 'd say
i don 't think so
UNknown photographs of a certain royal UNknown
until we get our hands on these snaps the police can 't move
the public prosecutor won 't move and the home office doesn 't want to know
has anyone actually seen these photographs ?
yes but at the minute i 'm not at liberty to say who that person is
we UNknown e had michael x under surveillance for quite a while
he keeps a safe deposit box at the lloyd 's bank in UNknown
we believe that 's were the photos are located
i UNknown l send a team into this bank and take whatever he 's got in this safe deposit box
that would have to be UNknown at the highest level and that 's not going to happen
do you see our problem ?
there can be no connection to 5 or 6
so you want me to come up with something devoid any UNknown for anyone
we 'd welcome suggestions tim
and if it all goes pear shaped wrong i assume it 's my arse on the line ?
you 'r e young and ambitions tim
a chance to make a name for yourself
i UNknown l have to check your underwear
we found what we 'r e looking for
what were you looking for ?
oh tim thank god !
i 'm in a spot of bother
i UNknown e got problems
i was in morocco recently
so we 'r e gonna sit here all night making small talk ?
i know you terry and i know your mates friends
you UNknown e always been looking for the big score the one that makes sense of everything
a bank as in robber ?
what would you know about a bank ?
next month they 'r e UNknown new alarms in a bank at UNknown
seems like the trains have been setting off the UNknown alarms in the vault and they UNknown e had to turn them off
so for a week or so they won 't have any
now why would he tell you all this ?
we were having a laugh about it
imagine if half the villains in in london knew about this he said
and i thought i know half the villains in london
i grew up with some of them
look me and my mates have been involved in the odd bit of UNknown criminal acts
can you see us UNknown up taking on a bank like the jesse james gang ?
this isn 't about waving a UNknown at a cashier 's head
this is about getting into the basement where the deposit boxes are
money and jewels they 'r e safe to steal
UNknown UNknown people won 't report it
you can 't talk about this here
it 's a once in a lifetime opportunity terry
we can 't pass it up
i didn 't expect this from you tonight UNknown
what did you expect ?
i UNknown l have to think about it
you better get off to your stag party
eddie tells me his brother invited you to the wedding
i UNknown l see you there
well tim UNknown what do you think ?
so you 'r e coming in ?
i don 't know it 's late
do you need to run home like a good little boy ?
i guess i UNknown e got time
what exactly do you do ?
bit of this bit of that
how did you and UNknown meet ?
i met UNknown in los angeles last spring
he was UNknown money for a black UNknown school and writing his life 's story
and what an extraordinary life it has been
the book is called from the dead level malcolm x and me
i UNknown e read the manuscript
the voice of the black soul
a friend is throwing a thing next week to celebrate the launch of brother UNknown 's book and you are all invited
UNknown tell us more about your book
it 's about being born black in america
can any of you imagine what it is like to be born a black man in this world ?
can any of you white women imagine what it would be like to bring a black baby into this world ?
why are we even having this conversation ?
maybe that 's why we could get away with it
it 's a bit UNknown isn 't it ?
you know what scares me more ?
living and dying with nothing to show for it
and how would you know that fact terry ?
because it 's tattooed on that stripper 's arse kevin
what the fuck 's it matter how i know ?
it 's a fact and you 'r e missing the point UNknown
what i 'm trying to say is we stop fucking about and stop picking the shit from under our fingernails
what are you two doing here personally ?
i thought you were way past being a UNknown jerry
your associate sonia UNknown has raised prices at that knocking shop of hers 120 quid up from a 100
a rising tide lifts all ships mate
i think we are owed some money
cause even sonia 's can be raided
yeah you would do that wouldn 't you ?
you 'd kill the goose that lays you golden eggs
wouldn 't that be dumb would it ?
but then again everyone knows coppers are dumb
now you can do one thing for me
you stop your UNknown from having their boys night out in my clubs
they 'r e loud they 'r e lewd horny and they expect free UNknown sex
you know what that 's disgusting
my most of them have families
we UNknown l pass the word along
lew you tell your greedy little UNknown cops to find their UNknown extra income elsewhere
no one is going to bother me
my patrons could have a lot of these UNknown UNknown cut out of pasture
well i 'd say spread the wealth around and keep the peace
five quid a week extra
it 's all it 's worth
lord UNknown can i offer you a drink before your session ?
very kind of you sonia
yes that 's a good girl
so you were in a magazine the other day ?
must have been an old one i 'm not modeling any more
i don 't know why
you 'r e still a knockout
a bit of film work
you 'r e still snapping i see
no no these are just photos for the family
and the odd snap of a wayward husband
so what 's the verdict boys ?
first thing we should do is take a look at the place UNknown check it out
maybe open a box of our own
i UNknown e already done that
we can go and have a look tomorrow
she 's adorable your little one
UNknown you want to dance ?
she 's being sarcastic ?
i suppose what she meant was money can 't by what we have
didn 't you use to go out with her ?
no love that was kevin
he had this big thing for her
i remember that night you were with your mate audrey at that UNknown
i saw this gorgeous little bum in a pencil skirt and i thought
oh i UNknown e gotta have that
daddy daddy come and dance with me
you 'r e an actor right ?
so what are these films you 'r e in ?
technically it 's what you 'd call UNknown
so you UNknown e been going around town with a 12 inch mutton dagger hanging down your pants ?
for the posh party at the weekend
so how come you UNknown e got the inside note on this place UNknown ?
are you getting married ?
all the best ones are
UNknown road and baker street on the corner here is the bank next door is the chicken inn and at 189 le UNknown
in the back is an underground car park with direct access to the shops UNknown
we can pull in here from UNknown street into the car park for UNknown and UNknown without being seen from the street
we UNknown l dig a tunnel from the basement of the shop under the chicken inn and pop up in the safe deposit vault
i UNknown e got a question
but i know a man who does
so what do you reckon UNknown ?
what do i reckon ?
i reckon i know you guys but i don 't know her
don 't worry about UNknown she 's solid
terry you have been up to some mischief in your time but this this is serious shit my friend
don 't you think it 's a little out of your league ?
maybe it 's time to step up to the first division
there 's going to be UNknown concrete under the vault
we 'r e going to need a UNknown lance a UNknown a generator
lights ropes cables the works
it 's about 40 feet UNknown of digging before we 'r e under the bank
we can hire some UNknown UNknown from camden town to do the digging
why don 't we just pay their national UNknown contributions ?
and then you have to get on your tommy UNknown suit
thank you that was great
what are your plans ?
i am returning to trinidad to liberate my brothers and sisters from the UNknown of the british UNknown
what about the charges you are facing ?
how can you leave england ?
they are liars and cowards
if they had anything against me but their fear of me
i 'd be tried and jailed
but we gonna need a front man on this someone who can sign the lease on the shop and looks the business
i know someone guy singer
but that 's a lot of UNknown
he has got this white posh accent if anyone comes UNknown about
a bit tight under the arms dont you think ?
one can 't raise ones arms above one 's head
it tends to UNknown any impulsive acts of surrender
i UNknown l be right back sir
what on earth are you doing here ?
got a bit of business for you here guy
you UNknown l be tempted
what do you think you 'r e doing ?
taking the e jaguar e type for a test drive
tell your boss he can have his inventory back when he settles mr UNknown 's debt
and it 'd better be soon or we UNknown l be back to tap through his UNknown
so come on then what don 't i know ?
all UNknown i UNknown e caused us a few problems with all these cars aren 't selling
all i was trying to do is get ahead of the game
it 's for all of us
for you and the kids
and how afraid do i have to be terry ?
it 'd be the best smart thing if you wanted to stay with your aunt in case things turn out cursed that is
25 to run my girls till i return from trinidad
it 's all right you don 't have to worry
i UNknown l look after your little flock of birds like they were my own
as long as you remember they are not your own
lew while i 'm back in trinidad
you want my opinion ?
all these drugs are responsible for the moral decay of this countries young
that 's my special area of interest
you should think about it
i have something so special i don 't need to pay anyone
whatever it is you can 't be UNknown
i hope you 'r e keeping it safe
yes as safe as it can be
in a place that you recommended transcript by r o g a r d

give us a light dave
what 's down there ?
lamb of god forgive us our sins
you all know what year that was don 't you ?
the last time west ham won the f a cup ?
it was the great plague of london
this must be a burial chamber
a crypt where they dumped the bodies
well if these poor bastards had the plague then they could be UNknown
i don 't think so dave
this crypt goes all the way under the bank
it UNknown l put us in the vault quicker
if we hit the restaurant by mistake we UNknown l be knee deep in fried chicken
i UNknown l be happy if we don 't hit the sewage
i 'm a ham radio operator and i think i may be overhearing a robbery in progress
we 'r e in !
we 'r e gonna move into the vault after we take a break
later when the UNknown 's cleared out
you 'r e having a laugh ain 't you ?
i can hardly breathe in there
what in the actual vault ?
we 'r e taking a break
look money may be your god but it ain 't mine all right ?
you UNknown l get your cup of tea
i rang 4 other police stations before you but nobody took me UNknown
they said it was probably a hoax
how strong was the signal mr UNknown ?
i 'd say they were within a 10 mile radius
there must be a ton of banks in that area
and when was the last time you picked them up ?
they UNknown e been quiet for about an hour
what about releasing the UNknown to the radio and tv ?
if they hear themselves they UNknown l stop UNknown
no we should keep listening
maybe they UNknown l reveal where they are
alfie you stay here with mr UNknown
i am going back to the station
you scared the piss out of me
what are you doing here ?
yeah i 'm a bit UNknown nervous myself
i just had to come and have a look
our future is in those boxes
UNknown love will cease to exist
why do you think if you vanish you UNknown l become someone else ?
at least no one will know who i was
why did you pick kevin and me ?
you could have found better thieves
must be old times you spent with kevin not me
kevin has it in his mind that we had this passionate affair
the truth is it came down to 4 chinese meals and a roll in the hay
let 's make some money
guys what 's going on ?
how would your wife fancy a tiara ?
give us a hand with this one
what 's so special about this box ?
it 's my lucky number
you know who that is ?
terry anything for the widows and UNknown funds ?
god bless you you 'r e very generous
look we have to have some sort of system
you don 't know what you are throwing or what you are keeping
yeah but we know what money looks like
we 'r e not throwing that away are we ?
bait to lure the fish
no they are not there not UNknown
they are not there sir
move to the next bank unit 2
we still get nothing sarge
ok unit 2 move to the next location
my god the stuff that some people collect
sounds like a good year to me
will you pass it round ?
coppers are on your doorstep
sergeant we just heard the thieves lookout say that there are police outside the bank right now
i haven 't got a clue
we UNknown e got patrols outside half the banks in the west end
guys a black car just pulled up with some bloke
he 's going up to the front door with the cops
UNknown he is UNknown the front door
i want to look inside
can 't be opened until tomorrow morning
well it isn 't my bank that 's being robbed
sorry for calling you on a sunday morning sir
fellows i think they are going away
we should get out of here
are you there UNknown ?
the ambulance reports it 's outside the lloyd 's bank on baker street
UNknown are you there ?
look if he 's not picking up something is wrong
so grab all the cash and the jewels and get the fuck out of here

we cant leave anything that might incriminate us
we come back for it if we can
what about all the other boxes ?
put everything in a bag and lets go !
all right let 's move it
there 's nothing here sarge

stop them as soon as possible
what have i done guv 'n or boss ?
open the back door come on
UNknown 's the van ?
none of us have met your boyfriend
he 's all go to include you on the back of the job
could UNknown e set us up
we bloody well pulled it off
done with military precision hey major ?
now that i am UNknown secure
i 'm going to buy my mom a new house
i thought you would be off to UNknown dave ?
why would i go to UNknown ?
you know what i UNknown l do ?
i UNknown l chop off one more and then i got one like your little UNknown UNknown
how did you find this place then terry ?
a bloke and i used to run a chop shop here stolen cars sold in parts
he 's in the nick jail now
how could you lose control of the operation ?
i thought you were on top of this thing
and we have no idea where the fuck they are
you know an ugly thought has just UNknown
lots of money in that vault UNknown bonds
you and your sweetie haven 't cooked up something between you i hope
you think i 'd betray you ?
two of our former colleagues now live in bloody moscow
let 's hope they don 't have another bidder
she won 't cross us
she knows what we 'r e capable of
how does she even know who the hell we are ?
i 'm sure she will contact me when she comes to her senses
going anywhere else would be a death sentence
you better hope she does everett
or it may be yours
i UNknown e seen this bloke on the tv
i have seen this face before
he 's an m p member of parliament
always wears those UNknown bow ties
well on that picture he 's not
i believe this is one of your old movies dave
i believe i UNknown l take my share and be on my way before the bank opens in the morning and the shit hits the proverbial fan
i 'm with you guy
i don 't have to remind you
no buying UNknown martins UNknown
the only thing i 'm buying is a one way ticket back to cyprus
i 'm never coming back
we should have a reunion
20 years the savoy grill
yeah right maybe for you guy
okay what 's going on ?
you two have been staring daggers at each other since we left the bank
lover 's UNknown quarrel ?
i think UNknown has got something to tell us
where do these come from ?
you knew the exact box this stuff was in UNknown
you 'd better come clean and tell us what this is really about
about a month ago i got busted at UNknown on a drug charge
this guy i know said he would fix it to keep me out of jail if i do him a favour
he knew i knew some villains
he wanted to set up a robbery to get these
that would be the bloke you met in the player 's club
well so who is he ?
he 's a guy i met at the sombrero club
he works for some shady outfit in white hall
you mean mi fucking 5 ?
we could get seriously nicked here UNknown !
all tim wants is the contents of box 118
the deal with him is we get to keep everything else
and you believe that ?
you put your trust in some prick we UNknown e never even met
you lied to us UNknown !
we were sitting ducks right from ther start
you think it 's a coincidence that you get busted for drugs and your tim just happens to have a plan to rob a bank ?
we give him the photos and everything else in that box and we get to keep the rest and we 'r e free and clear
these people are regular UNknown bad cops UNknown
they do things coppers can 't
they think we UNknown e seen these photos we 'r e expendable as dog shit
i UNknown e seen our shots and i don 't know we 'r e either dog shit or about to beat dog shit
i 'm out of here
i 'm not waiting for a load of spooks and coppers to come cracking my head
i 'm splitting like guy and UNknown
it would be better if we stuck together dave
and why tell me ? UNknown UNknown we UNknown e been so truthful with each other so far ?
no i 'm going home UNknown
and then i 'm going far away as far as i can get away from you
we 'd better get out of here too
in case guy and UNknown get picked up
let 's split the lot of this
there may be someone else in this shit to cause us some more grief
find the bank raid !
police last night were trying to home in on a 300 000 bank raid
they still don 't know what bank it was
it 's a bit more than that
i know what you mean
why don 't you come over to my place ?
you would have been there haven 't you ?
probably have your men keeping lookout for me now
you 'r e not in a position to play games UNknown
why didn 't you tell me what it was i was set up to get you ?
i suppose i give you what you want and we go our separate ways
london vaults checked after radio ham tunes in to a crime
christ what a UNknown !
and now the particular bank has been identified the story will be all over the news
we UNknown e heard it already is
if we don 't get onto the case quickly the police will have nabbed these robbers and god knows what will happen to our photographs
philip get over to the bank
i UNknown e just had a conversation with one UNknown love
call was traced to a public phone box on miller 's court
good news is she 's arranged a meet
tim has agreed to meet
it 's all over the news
they found the location of the bank
i 'm sorry ma 'a m you can 't go in
there 's been a robbery
you work in robbery now then ?
you 'r e a long way off your patch
just went by to see what all the fuss is about
pretty cheeky that radio bit
these UNknown talkie robbers certainly caught your lot on the hop
you 'r e pretty chummy with all the villains around town
you got any idea who could have done this ?
we have been waiting here quite some time and so far you people have told us absolutely nothing
if you would like to give us an UNknown list of the content of your boxes we may be able to UNknown
are you mad ? what 's missing
the whole point in having a safe deposit box is so that people like you don 't know what 's in it !
i want to speak to a roy given
this robbery is now a matter of national security
UNknown 5 or 6 i can never tell the difference
they all got the same tailor and they all went to the same bloody school
let 's get some copies of the UNknown talkie UNknown out to the news boys
maybe the public can help identify the villains
oh we 'r e in a UNknown jerry
now why is it my problem ?
accounts have to be balanced records kept
and i wouldn 't likely keep the books around here now would i ?
i have a ledger a record of every payment
i UNknown e ever made to you and your colleagues
and i think you UNknown l agree we have to find those villains before your honest colleagues do
your safety deposit box at the baker street bank what 's its number ?
so if your box is in the
no one touches me follows me or UNknown takes your stuff right to fleet street understood ?
you want box 118 tim
you have no idea of the danger you and your chums are in do you ?
and what would that be ?
you UNknown e opened pandora 's box you dumb prick that 's why
i know what 's at stake
and i know how expendable we are
some change in the deal
you UNknown l get all your nasty pictures but here 's the twist
we UNknown l get indemnity fresh passports safe passage out of the country
and an officially signed document UNknown we won 't be prosecuted and we won 't be pursued
you can 't be serious ?
you can bet your UNknown i 'm serious
i want it signed and delivered by a public figure of substantial authority
how about the prime minister ?
yeah he UNknown l do if you can drag him off his yacht
you mess with us tim
we can drip feed pictures like this to the press
we UNknown e got a stack of UNknown m
you UNknown e got until UNknown to confirm that we have a deal
do you have any more ?
apparently there is a whole rose gallery stored in one of those boxes
if lord UNknown is up to his usual UNknown UNknown strange sex life that 's his problem
this operation is about recovering the photos from michael x
might it not be prudent to get the committee to consider issuing a d notice ?
defence notice to protect national secrets
when i came out there were a couple of lads taking some photos
he was standing right outside the bank just a few days before it was robbed
i thought at the time he looked a bit UNknown
christ is that thing real ?
you UNknown l catch your death
i wonder if we could have a word
i have a very UNknown bitter view of life
from what i see most of it is corrupt UNknown and vile
and i am just saying this so that you know that i don 't have a better nature to appeal to or a compassionate streak
i mean you do understand don 't you ?
i have a kidney stone that does not seem to be able to pass without UNknown
i could use a couple of those myself
you stole from me and from friends of mine
where is my stuff ?
you 'r e still an UNknown actor mr shilling
i would love to say this is not going to hurt but it is
what are you going to do ?
what are you gonna do ?
why is the door open ?
i could ask the same thing
you better run along eh ? transcript by r o g a r d
get yourselves a cup of tea or something
we are looking for terry leather
terry said he would not be coming in this week
he is supposed to call in
so you would be eddie right ?

don 't you worry darling
they were put up to the job by a woman named UNknown love
well we paid a visit to her flat and some chaps from UNknown 5 were already there
pulled rank on my tame copper
why do you suppose these people would be interested in the robbery of a minor neighbourhood bank michael ?
photographs of a certain royal princess
how do you know that ?
because on this point i believe my captive
no man could withstand the pain we inflicted on him
so don 't take me for a fool michael !
you UNknown e UNknown this calamity by UNknown your blackmail materials in this bank
i will not be UNknown by the porn king of soho
get my pictures back or you will never see a black man on the streets of london without wondering if he 's been sent to kill you !
what are you doing ?
UNknown was looking for a copy of his book
i know what you UNknown e been looking for
you won 't find it
my box and those of my friends may have been UNknown
surely you can pull some strings
you 'r e a minister in the government for god 's sake !
sonia i really don 't think i am able to help here
perhaps you don 't fully comprehend
i have photographs UNknown photographs
miles UNknown all my UNknown in this safe deposit box
you all know each other if that 's any consolation
you UNknown e got photographs of me ?

terry leather kevin swain UNknown love eddie burton
yeah mr shilling was kind enough to speak with me about this
you put dave on the phone
just a couple of things from what you UNknown e stolen
a ledger with a dark red cover
and some photos that i 'm sure the UNknown 5 is interested in
all we got is money and jewels
then i suggest you look again

no you UNknown e got to have what they want you UNknown e got to
you UNknown e got to help
eddie what am i supposed to do ?
that 's what this bastard is
payments made to soho and west end division officers
probably every bad copper in london
nothing like this was supposed to happen
no one was supposed to get hurt
it 's not your fault right ?
we still got our own exit to think about and eddie
if we give the photos to vogel all bets are off with tim
if we deliver it to tim it 's eddie 's neck and vogel is still after us
either way we are fucked
miles we UNknown e got a problem a serious problem
something sonia UNknown kept in the bank that was robbed over the weekend
she is concerned that her safe deposit box may have been plundered
i 'm afraid her fears are well justified
the genie is out of the bottle then
for both of us UNknown ?
my UNknown tell me that the thieves are using the photographs as a bargaining chip
then give them what they want
and the committee having done the works to issue a d notice on the whole business
to UNknown silence the press
put a lid on it
big pity wouldn 't it ?
you listen to me mr vogel or whatever your fucking name is
you go ahead and kill him we don 't give a shit
your UNknown and your photos you can pick them up from scotland yard
we 'r e sending them over
well if you want your book of UNknown back be at UNknown station in person tomorrow 11 am platform 1

and nobody steals from michael x
see if it mentions the copper in charge
heading the case is detective sergeant

it 's kind of scary actually
so where are you headed ?
if everything goes to plan ?

the meeting was considered closed thank you for your attention !
UNknown subs http subtitles ee UNknown subs UNknown translate !
you know after last year 's corporate my wife was always encouraging me
you know she said you did fine you did fine in the corporate
i was a bit nervous
that 's nice eh ?
nice background with the people there
we are here at the must i look ?
just look straight at the lens
we are here at the
my name is UNknown van de UNknown
and behind me you can see the alien affairs workers
the doors didn 't open for 3 months
and they eventually decided after much UNknown that the best thing to do would be to physically cut their way in
we were on the verge of first contact
the whole world was watching
expecting i don 't know music from heaven and bright shining lights
the creatures were extremely UNknown they were very unhealthy they seemed to be UNknown
there was a lot of international pressure on us at the time
the entire world was looking at johannesburg so we had to do the right thing
the government then established an aid group that started to ferry the aliens to a temporary camp set up just beneath the ship
we didn 't have a plan
there was a million of them
so what was a temporary holding zone soon became UNknown became UNknown
and before we knew it it was a slum
but the truth is nobody really knew what this place was
there 's a lot of secrets in district 9
at first a lot of attention was given to giving the aliens a proper status and protection
they 'r e spending so much money to keep them here
when they could be spending it on other things but at least they 'r e keeping them separate from us
i want to be realistic with everyone
the aliens will not be able to go home
did it fall by itself or was it UNknown ?
examination of the old video footage shows very clearly that a piece falls from the ship
this piece that 's falling caused us bloody problems
more energy weapon UNknown found
the special task force conducted raids in district 9
where there 's a weapon there 's crime
people became more and more fed up and eventually the UNknown started
residents in UNknown UNknown for the third UNknown night in an attempt to remove all the aliens from their UNknown
i think they must fix that ship and they must go
a virus a UNknown virus
release it near the aliens
i don 't know where just go
if they was from another country we might understand
but they are not even from this planet
the government have enforced a UNknown curfew
the aliens UNknown they take my wife away
the UNknown term UNknown is used for the alien and obviously it UNknown something that is a bottom UNknown that UNknown the leftovers
i mean you can 't say they don 't look like that
that 's what they look like right ?
the aliens made off with an UNknown amount of cash
what for an alien might be seen as something UNknown setting fire to a truck UNknown a train is for us obviously an extremely destructive act
they can take the UNknown you are wearing off you
they take whatever you have on you
your cell phone or anything
after that they kill you
and now after 20 years public pressure had forced the government to shift the aliens out of johannesburg
they had had enough and they wanted district 9 to be moved and more UNknown UNknown and controlled
so to enforce this mass eviction the government turned to UNknown
welcome all and thank you for coming
please listen very closely to this briefing
today we start a very complex and delicate operation
this is the largest operation that UNknown has ever UNknown and we believe that it is going to be UNknown successfully
it is to move 1 8 million UNknown from their present home in district 9 to a safer and better location 200 kilometers outside of johannesburg city
we built a nice new facility where the UNknown can go he can be comfortable he can stay there
the people of johannesburg and of south africa are going to live happily and safely knowing that that UNknown is very far away
UNknown protocol dictates that we give the aliens 24 hours notice of our right to evict
today you will serve these notices getting the aliens to sign i 27 form
the UNknown that UNknown is using to evict the aliens is simply a whitewash
i 'm going to appoint a field officer to take direct command
everybody always said that UNknown was not a very smart boy but he was a wonderful son
that was my UNknown just
feels like life on the big stage
i had to put aside the fact that my daughter was married to UNknown
that didn 't affect my decision to promote him
it 's almost as big as my wedding day
you know not as big
UNknown was always making me things
he said that way they just mean so much more
he left this paper UNknown bowl on the sofa one day and i didn 't see it and i sat down and i kinda UNknown it
they took all his stuff away for the investigation and
i made them bring it all back
how is it going man ?
i 'm not saying what he did was right but he took the choices that were given to him
UNknown is the guy that i UNknown e selected to replace me
if he can make it today eh ?
i UNknown l make it
i just want everyone watching this right now to learn from what has happened
you would think things like this would happen to somebody else not to me
how is it going man ?
have you got my stuff ?
how is it going ?
i 'm all right boss
good good this is UNknown
he is training with us today
i think i was disgusted with the way he worked
there was always just a hint of something not quite kosher with mr van de UNknown
nobody saw it coming at all
none of us had any idea of what he was doing
i think it is a great thing to see that it 's not the military guys in charge this time
not to say that UNknown and his cowboys are not wanted
you guys are always wanted
you see now these are the cowboys
they shoot first and then they answer the questions
sorry is this above the UNknown amount of ammunition ?
because i see your UNknown are full but
i think maybe you should speak to the colonel
f a g over here says that we got too much ammunition
no all i 'm saying UNknown is that you know you should find ways of making you guys more efficient
listen to me you fuck !
get him outta my face
there are rules we 'r e all living by rules in this world
well i don 't think he can be forgiven for what he did cause it 's like a betrayal
i UNknown e gotta get going les
i think we 'r e gonna have to cut this interview cause we 'r e gonna go
12 UNknown from UNknown 9
the UNknown doesn 't really understand the concept of ownership of property
so we have to come there and say listen this is our land
please will you go ?
it 's difficult to put the vest on by yourself
thomas can you help me ?
they told me i was gonna get the vest inside the casper
thomas just look on the side if there 's a vest there ?
i 'm just concerned about my family
don 't worry about the vest it UNknown l be fine
rights groups have demanded that UNknown should comply with all UNknown regulations in district 9
we 'r e coming to you from the entrance of district 9 as today UNknown national united sets out to UNknown approximately 1 8 million alien residents from their homes
human rights groups are keeping a watchful eye as many suspect UNknown might occur
we 'r e seeing heavily armed private security forces being deployed into district 9
backed up by significant air support
we UNknown l go shack to shack and get them to sign the form
we 'r e seeing the convoy stop
the operation is about to begin
where is he going ?
it 's clear that security is very high
this is only the beginning of a total clamp down
open the door please !
this is UNknown van de UNknown from UNknown
we are here to serve you an eviction notice
you just put your UNknown there
we UNknown e got his UNknown there
because as he hit it it counts as a UNknown
first time we come in there will always be a little bit of tension happening between us and them
hey you can 't eat that man !
the UNknown likes to eat the rubber
to him it 's like a UNknown
don 't confront him like that !
did you see that ?
this is gonna be a problem cause now all UNknown are coming out they wanna see what 's going on
see everybody is gathering now
don 't shoot or you 'r e gonna turn it into a UNknown !
is that a tear gas ?
no it 's cat food
one of them attacked the UNknown and he 's lost his arm
no it 's not my house
i don 't live here
well that 's a pity because you know this
this is a nice cat food you know
but of course it 's not your house
it 's my house !
we need you to sign here
the creatures became incredibly obsessed with cat food
something about it like UNknown for cats
we are here to serve eviction notices
what we have stranded on earth in this colony is basically the workers that are unable to think for themselves
they will take commands they have no initiative
they UNknown e lost all the apt of leadership through whatever cause
i 'm holding steady over UNknown compound area
where there 's a slum there 's crime
and district 9 was no exception
the UNknown had various UNknown going
one of them was the cat food scam
where they sold cat food to the aliens for UNknown prices
you put the money here first
you don 't get anything until you pay
what are you trying to do ?
i UNknown l chop your balls off
not to mention UNknown prostitution and they also dealt in alien UNknown
you have a car UNknown there 's a chop shop there you can see that that 's somebody 's car in there
the UNknown in district 9 are headed by a man called UNknown
he 's a very powerful underground figure in johannesburg
you don 't want to play with these boys
they will cut you into pieces
that 's the boss there
don 't look at him !
this is gonna cause problems
check the other side !
control this is UNknown van de UNknown
i need a population control team at UNknown 766 immediately please
check the other side thomas !
there is 40 to 50 eggs in here
this is an amazing find
i can just show you a little bit how it works
basically a cow is hung from the ceiling you can see here
very little of it left of course because all these pipes supply the UNknown to the little UNknown eggs
you can do one i can show you want to see ?
okay no more UNknown to the guy
then finally we take air back
the little guy is gone to a nice little sleep now
you pop him out there we go
you wanna keep it as a souvenir of your first abortion
okay here it comes guys
if we were going to UNknown each egg one at the time it 'd take a very long time
so this makes a lot of sense
that 's a popping sound that you 'r e hearing
it 's almost like a popcorn
what the egg does it pops up
the little guy what 's left of him pops out there
so that 's the sound that you 'r e hearing with the popping
you don 't need that man
been drinking a little bit here eh ?
what are you doing with this television set sir ?
hey smile for the cameras here
that 's a first day find
that 's a big find
trent look at this !
there 's weapons all over here
some of the guns are small but if it shoot you it make a big mess
UNknown is trying to move the aliens for UNknown reasons
but the real focus just as it has been right from the beginning is weapons
UNknown is the second largest weapons manufacturer in the world
we assumed that we 'd be able to pick up the alien UNknown gun and just be able to shoot but it didn 't work like that
because as we discovered their technology is actually engineered in a biological manner to UNknown exclusively with their dna
it just doesn 't work with humans
and it 's as simple as that
this is basically a guy and there 's 3 humans here
basically trying to make a warning you know
he 's saying i kill 3 humans watch out for me
hey don 't UNknown on your own bloody get back get back
this is UNknown requesting first battalion escort please
you want to talk to them or you want to talk to me ?
okay guys thanks very much
yeah i know he had a spade
look i find some !
i tell you before this is human technology it is useless
only our technology contains the fluid
this is not our technology ?
this is what we need
why must it take so long ?
because it is very difficult so much can go wrong
our plan is ready now ?
quiet listen they are coming
they must not find it
you see this is the problem
this is the gang sign
so again looks like we have more and more gang members
UNknown you just stay back
this place is swarming with UNknown
i must get back to my son
don 't make them angry be polite !
we would like you to nobody is here
that is totally UNknown !
i 'm gonna have a look
sir we have to serve you an eviction notice
this is a classic kind of UNknown shack i can tell you
we 'r e gonna find weapons here
watch your head don 't hit the cows
ah you hear that ?
i haven 't see this type of setup
it 's almost like a chemistry type of a set
it 's gotta be something
i don 't know this has got the markings there of so it is definitely alien
but it 's not a weapon
but i don 't trust it
are you all right ?
UNknown are you all right ?
are you gonna cut that part out trent where it UNknown me ?
we just found a dangerous object here
it has a fuel in and i suspect it might leak onto people or cause damage
so we just check that in and we take that down nicely to the lab
it 's not a weapon but it 's dangerous
he 's got weapons somewhere here my sense is telling me that
thomas keep the gun on him
ok i got it sir !
keep the gun on him thomas there 's weapons here !
oh this is christmas !
this is christmas my friends
this is the biggest find that i UNknown e ever seen
UNknown van de UNknown requesting first reaction battalion
this gun i UNknown e never seen
have you seen this ?
what gun is this ?
this is absolutely amazing !
what are you doing ?
i wanna show this to thomas
but i thought you said you can 't handle it
no i am not handling it i 'm just gonna show it
i 'm not gonna use it man
it doesn 't even work with humans
thomas look at this gun !
you hear this sir ?
you see what 's happening ?
you know what that means ?
that means that your days of UNknown the law are over
have a look you see that ?
that 's a firing team
are you all right ?
where do you think you 'r e going eh ?
where do you think you 'r e going ?
you wanna piss me off ?
UNknown to base come in !
i UNknown e got two people down
it 's the UNknown yankee 5 3 0 copy ?
and we need a UNknown UNknown UNknown
no that 's fine UNknown
i don 't need a UNknown UNknown
UNknown you burned your arm you need to
i UNknown l just treat it here UNknown
you should just get it checked out
i UNknown l just have it treated by the medics
did you see how fast that UNknown was trent ?
he was fast i promise you
i told you not to touch that
go outside and watch for humans
where is your friend ?
yeah i 'm just a bit hot
are you guys hot ?
yeah if you can 't stand the heat get out of the kitchen
this is what i mean
that 's why we get rid of them
yeah that 's why we UNknown
lets just shoot the little bastard

UNknown has sweets for you
there you go eat your UNknown
works like a charm every time
you almost UNknown my eye out with the UNknown UNknown
i tried to be UNknown nice to you man !

i 'm sorry i 'm sorry
i UNknown e had enough of your stupid games
what do you want ?
we require your UNknown on this eviction UNknown
why am i being evicted ?
yes it 's an eviction notice
so put your name in the bottom
it says you must give me 24 hours notice
you 'r e going to another place
a nice new city built especially for UNknown
and we are not even going to charge you okay ?
this guy is obviously he 's a little sharper
seems like we didn 't understand each other there properly eh ?
so you UNknown e got a little one there
there 's a litter out here
this is dangerous conditions for your child
article 75 says that because your child is living in dangerous conditions i 'm gonna take him down to child services
i 'm gonna go and have a little chat with your son
you keep away from my child !
don 't point your UNknown tentacles at me !
you said you want to stay ?
your boy is coming down with me to child services
he 's gonna spend the rest of his life in 1 by 1 meter box
it 's the UNknown man coming !
fuck look at this trent !
thomas keep the gun on him
he is definitely a criminal !
he 's got a whole computer shop here man !
you know this is amazing
i mean this is obviously you can see stolen computers now that he 's decorating his place with
definitely he doesn 't have the permit for this
it 's the UNknown man
trent turn it off !
are you okay boss ?
shall i leave him ?
just fuckin leave him yeah
i UNknown l see you tomorrow christopher johnson
when dealing with aliens try to be polite but firm
and always remember that a smile is cheaper than a bullet
how are you feeling ?
i 'm fine i 'm alright
i 'm just a little bit dizzy
can you just pull up there on the side ?
i just want to get something to eat here
are you sure you should be having that ?
after your whole UNknown episode ?
i feel a lot better
it 's a silver cylinder
i can 't find it
we trade for ten thousand cans
certain UNknown of UNknown gangs want to try and extract UNknown from district 9
and have been trying to for many many years
yes yes but we take them all now
get them the UNknown hurry up
and they UNknown thousands of these weapons
without the ability to use them
what do you want from me ?
i just want to talk
they UNknown l believe anything
UNknown is a south african word
today it 's UNknown with UNknown and magic
cures high blood when you boil it cures sugar diabetes all diseases
the UNknown were consuming alien body parts
they believed that by doing so they were UNknown their power to use alien UNknown
and their power will live in you
just give me a fucking chance to go in front of you man !
hi baby come in !
i had a small incident baby
i 'm just gonna go to the toilet and then i UNknown l talk to people okay ?
i need to talk to you
okay but i just gotta
guys can you give us a moment please ?
what happened out there ?
this UNknown wouldn 't listen to me one really UNknown UNknown and i just had to get him in my grasp
listen to me too many aliens died out there today
UNknown is all over my backside
focus ! you 'r e not going to fuck this up for me !
if you can 't do the job i UNknown l find someone who can !
nice to see you again
baby are you okay ?
okay let 's cut some cake
doctor smith please come to room 405 doctor smith
is it badly infected ?
there 's a lot of UNknown
also you should know on my right hand some fingernails were coming loose
and i had a black fluid coming out of my nose and sort of a black vomit
what is happening to my arm doctor ?
what is this thing ?
sir please tell my wife
attention all medical UNknown evacuate ward 11
what 's going on ?
what are you doing to him ?
where are you taking him ?
we decided not to use the anesthetic the reason being we can 't know how the subject will react
i think you should see this
i found it in his jacket
you think this is alien ?
what are they doing to these UNknown ?
pain threshold test one UNknown 7
that 's a strong pain reaction
that means the nerves have UNknown
i mean it 's almost completely UNknown
what are you doing ?
can you grip that ?
why are you doing this ?
you want me to shoot that ?
stand back and fire !
all right thanks very much
do you know where my wife is ?
no sir i will not pull
what did you say about your wife ?
he says he can pull it
i said i could pull it !
right we want him in the center by the chain
leave that fucking UNknown man i will shoot at pig
i UNknown l shoot sir !
listen i UNknown l shoot at pig again for you
i UNknown l pull the trigger
but i 'm not shooting at UNknown you hear me ?
listen you can 't use the real guy he didn 't do anything to you
i want to try this
i think that 's all we need
gentlemen we are running out of time
this is the key stage in the UNknown
his dna is in perfect balance between alien and human
and a problem is as the infection spreads the transition becomes permanent and less active
he 's going to turn into one of them
what happens to him isn 't important
what 's important is that we harvest from him what we can right now
this body represents hundreds of millions maybe billions of dollars worth of UNknown
there are people out there governments UNknown who 'd kill for this chance
will he survive the procedure ?
what about next of kin ?
don 't let them do it
i UNknown l handle that
okay i say let 's go
none of this makes any sense
he just hurt his arm dad
the doctors are trying sweetheart
doing their best to save him
we 'r e starting to harvest material from the specimen
we UNknown l start with the soft tissue first
cut through the chest UNknown
we need to get the heart out as quickly as possible
once it set the UNknown it just spread
he never was very strong
i UNknown l go through the chest go straight into the heart
can i see him ?
i UNknown l fuckin kill him !
you need to let go of him now
UNknown is that you ?
how dare you phone us !
what are all these people doing in my house ?
it 's none of your business
i need to speak to tania straight away please
this is my phone that you 'r e using mam
i 'm UNknown what ?
anton it 's me !
i UNknown e been friends with you for UNknown 13 years man !
what are you watching ?
we all thought it was for the best because he needed help
and he wasn 't gonna get that as a fugitive
he became the most valuable business UNknown on earth
he was the only human who had ever successfully been combined with alien UNknown and remained alive
can i get some cheese UNknown and one large sauerkraut please
we interrupt this program to bring you breaking news
a patient has escaped from the isolation ward and is loose in the city
UNknown van de UNknown was recently apprehended after prolonged sexual activity with aliens in district 9
i have to call my manager

don 't look at this hand !
this hand is fine !
we can 't come to the phone right now
control there 's no sign of mr van de UNknown
the entire world was watching him
he was on every radio station every image on television anything you could find had his face on it
so he had nowhere else to go
he ended up hiding in the one place he knew no one would ever come looking for him
i pay you next week i promise
no money you get nothing

it doesn 't matter it 's too late
are you saying that you can turn this UNknown hand into a human hand ?
you can make me human again ?
we can use this ship to fly up there
you guys are brilliant !
i always thought that UNknown were intelligent
i don 't have fluid
i could fix you and i could fly away
all right i tell you what
why don 't we go risk it some more ?
let 's go collect some up
it took twenty years to collect that amount
it 's four stories underground
why does he keep looking at me like that ?
we 'r e not the same
we 'r e not the UNknown same
there is a way out of this
we get the fluid back from UNknown
yeah and what then ?
then we both die eh ?
that 's a suicide mission man
can you not fill my head with that sort of nonsense ?
you don 't have much time
it 's not like my father said
i know he was lying to protect me
i just don 't know what to believe anymore
baby i know but listen to me
it 's all lies i swear to you
i just want you back
i want everything back the way it was
that 's baby that 's what i want

the people everywhere across johannesburg are flooding the streets and pouring out of their offices and all eyes are pointed up towards the sky on this momentous day
it 's the first time ladies and gentlemen in over two decades that the UNknown has shown any sign of movement and people are tremendously excited
the city had come to an absolute UNknown
everybody wants to know what 's going to happen next
this is the last known footage of UNknown van de UNknown
and we can only speculate as to what has happened to him
the more UNknown conspiracy theories state that he 's been captured by UNknown or by another government
or by perhaps some shady government agency and he 's actually being held in captivity
if we knew where he was we would try and help him and that is the most difficult part not knowing where he is
UNknown sadly is gone but i 'm the one who stays behind with all the questions
i can 't give the answers
he died in my mind a long time ago
UNknown van der UNknown is a name that will become very widely known because of this UNknown role that he played in this whole event
he was an honest man and he didn 't deserve any of what happened to him

they didn 't even do a good job of hiding it
UNknown UNknown is currently awaiting trial for exposing UNknown 's illegal genetic research program

i forgot the can opener
oh i can open them with UNknown
cigars and cigarettes the kind i UNknown e never smoked
i got it at the flea market
she 's right out of vaudeville !
i UNknown l keep her then
we don 't have much time
i 'm not worthy to speak to you
evelyne from the bar isn 't believable
you don 't belong in a bar
this is your place !
it 's obvious you used to be classy
i didn 't mean it like that
madam 's guests don 't drink ?
i forgot the wine !
henri would you be so kind
you don 't mind ?
i 'd bring you the moon
you 'r e a good man
you 'd make a good brother
then i UNknown l tell you again you 'r e making a mistake
forget about that and go !
henri get some mineral water too !
yes i UNknown l get some
what about kitchen towels ?
yeah there 's you !
here 's a present !
pierre do you like your bed ?
are we really going to stay here ?
wait a minute dear !
seriously i have something to tell you
two men are coming soon
above all don 't tell anybody we only moved here today
it 's hard to explain
it 's a grownup thing
they can 't know we haven 't always lived here
but that 's lying !
no i 'm not asking you to lie
oh it 's for pierre !
i don 't understand you
you met her and you 'r e having dinner
after what happened i 'd want to know
last night was too early
tonight i UNknown l try to ask her
i UNknown l arrange it so you 'r e alone
may i have it ?
a present for the kid
what did you get him ?
save that for your kids
for when you have kids
right i UNknown e teased you about that in the past
except for the sugar everything has changed
pierre you promised you 'd behave
it 's so much fun here i couldn 't sleep
look at my train !
your mother said it 's time for bed
be careful with the train !
hello evelyne it 's me
so did it work ?
how nice of you to call
oh you 'r e not alone
he 's not from the country
he 's very successful there
i UNknown l send some furs and dresses
don 't let him get away
go to sleep like a good little man
did you put him to bed ?
he 's a charming boy
this is all very sweet to me but also a little cruel
who is this uncle henri that pierre seems so fond of ?
is he a friend of the family ?
he 's a nice man
anyway it 's none of my business
but let 's talk about you
what have you been up to ?
i UNknown e been healing others
i never even thought about it
i thought i had forgotten
don 't worry it 's just a fuse
what were you doing ?
i UNknown e caused enough bother already
where 's the fuse box ?
i think it 's in the kitchen
this reminds me of the last time we met
we were so close together like tonight in the dark
i was holding your hand
i bet they get married
you could be a detective
you know lately i UNknown e had a thing for films that end in marriage
try to control yourself !
we 'r e not alone
i forgot to call a friend i was supposed to meet
i UNknown l be back
it drove me crazy !
why did you leave ?
you can 't control destiny but i swear
you believe me right ?
luckily i found a hair pin
we should let evelyne rest
we UNknown l be going
are you busy tomorrow ?
i UNknown l pick you up tomorrow
madam you UNknown l be happy
the boy will like it here
did you hear what she said ?
she 's nearly blind ?
armand is expecting us at 5 p m
where are you going ?
you 'r e very sick !
a doctor would never say that
he 'd say it will take time i UNknown l be back tomorrow
i UNknown l be back tomorrow
do you also care for birds ?
because i 'm worried about mine
they stayed at the apartment without any food
the one me and mom were at yesterday
where is this apartment ?
it 's on a small square
can you fix it ?
no the fuel line is blocked
now we 'r e stuck in the forest
what can we do ?
there 's a wheelbarrow in case your car doesn 't work
try to start a fire
no not like that !
i UNknown e been camping for 30 years
it 's so cold !
my feet are freezing !
put them near the fire
it seems like yesterday when i met you by the ski jump
and after it stopped snowing we took that path to town
with all the pine trees
let 's not think of what could have been
right let 's forget it
you may be the same man
i 'm not the same woman
yes you are babs !
nothing else matters to me
that 's what i wanted to tell you
and that 's why i stopped the car
you did it on purpose ?
i didn 't go to all this trouble for nothing
when you 'r e with me everything is nice
it feels like the beginning of the world
when a couple fall in love it 's like the world begins again
so you think i love you ?
did madam morin live here ?
she 's away for a few days
then it can 't be the same person
there 's only one madam morin
she works at the UNknown and has a boy named pierre
she asked me to pick up some birds that her boy forgot
okay we UNknown l go up and get them
is she coming back tomorrow ?
did she find a school ?
she 's a good woman in spite of her job
but what do you expect ?
she has to earn a living
as long as she pays the rent and she doesn 't bring back any men i don 't care
i 'd like to stay here forever
and not let the world touch our happiness
but that would be difficult
the world can 't hurt us
now we 'r e found with the same love
everything around us is sweet
this old room looks beautiful because we 'r e here
it will be always like this
we UNknown l live in the county
i can 't leave tomorrow
i don 't see why not
well i have a home and my life here
it 's not something you do in 24 hours
i UNknown l take another boat
no you should leave tomorrow
i UNknown l meet up with you in two weeks with pierre
hey since you 'r e going to be so busy
let pierre go with me
you want to take him ?
to make sure you UNknown l join me in two weeks
i UNknown l be there as soon as i can
listen have you ever seen a mother separated from her child ?
who just gives him to anyone ?
i UNknown l just take another boat
first i UNknown l drop you off
i UNknown l stop by the UNknown and i UNknown l pick you up in an hour for lunch with armand
babs i have you now
this time i won 't lose you
it 's time to get up
why did you get them ?
how did he know ?
i gave him the address and he got them
i UNknown l be back soon
while i was gone did a man come ask for me ?
yes he picked up the birds
did he ask about me ?
he seemed to know you so we talked a bit
what did you tell him ?
i told him you worked at the UNknown
why i shouldn 't have ?
it 's not your fault
can i help you madam ?
i know what you must think of me but before you talk to george you must know
your situation doesn 't need explaining
it 's perfectly clear to me
sorry to ruin your little plan
what are you thinking ?
everything i UNknown e done has been for george
stop your emotional act !
can 't you see i 'm a broken woman
i 'm not asking for anything else
i 'm not expecting anything
i used my last strength to lie to him to be the woman he knew ten years ago
i know i 'm not that woman
but you have no right to tell him
you weren 't better back then
you don 't treat a man the way you did !
i didn 't have a choice
when i met george i was already married
he never knew and i couldn 't tell him
the guy from the scandal who killed himself ?
i was married very young
a great catch my parents said
he got arrested six months later
i ran off and was going to get a divorce
he brought everything i wanted confidence love hope
we had plans for the future
then one night we were at the cinema
they brought me a note
he escaped and managed to cross the border
what do you want ?
we 'r e finished !
so leave me alone !
no i 'm not scared of you anymore
i said get in !
i know what 's going on
that 's why i came
your boyfriend is in there
i UNknown l get in
i UNknown l do whatever you want
i knew he was capable of anything
that same evening we left canada
in france life went on until that mishap which left me all alone after what happened
it was a downward UNknown
the bar and the rest
he must not find out
i don 't have the strength to lie anymore to him
yesterday i could but i can 't anymore
he asked me to marry him
he wants to take us with him
you you 'r e his friend
once he 's there i UNknown l write to him
i UNknown l tell him that i can 't meet up with him
that i thought it over and i didn 't feel the same
i don 't know !
don 't you want to tell him the truth ?
i UNknown l keep my secret till the end
that 's why he must leave tonight
you must never tell him
boss there 's a problem
a colony in the UNknown
don 't mention that place !
so what 's wrong ?
your 35 grand and the canadian yes ?
this morning he asked to keep his room for 3 weeks
but now he 's packing
she spoke a long time today with his friend
probably to get him to stay
don 't make so much noise !
why are you sick ?
i UNknown l cure you
when did you find out ?
you said he 'd stay as long as you wanted
i need to make a profit
i don 't care how
i UNknown l bring someone to you
try to be more cordial
don 't even think about it !
if you 'd rather be a UNknown
don 't act like that !
i helped when you needed me
who do you think you are ?
you do what i want !
i UNknown e punished others besides you !
don 't sneer at me !
i 'm no fool !
i UNknown l find out if you were cheating me
mom i 'm scared !
you 'r e not a baby
you have to be brave in life
he won 't be back
you UNknown l never hear him again
do you like george ?
would you like to go with him on a big boat ?
yes a lot of them
sure i want to go !
where is the boat going ?
to a beautiful country with forests and mountains snow
where they 'r e nice to children
is uncle armand coming with us ?
yes we UNknown l meet him at the station
the hospital back home must think i 'm crazy
first i 'm staying two more weeks then i 'm coming right away
so it 's settled then ?
you won 't change your mind ?
it 's much better for pierre to go with you
hey do you like trains ?
yes but it 's smaller than our boat
and there aren 't any elevators
keep a close eye on him
and be sure he wears warm clothes
he 's in your care both of yours
we UNknown l do our best
armand has over 200 kids under his care
yes i know but one child is more difficult
it won 't be for very long
pierre the train is about to leave
are you happy to be going ?
even if i 'm not there
be a good strong boy
hurry mom we 'r e going to miss the train
i UNknown l see you soon
it 's the last time we UNknown l part
yes like a friend should be
i would have gone and never told the truth
besides everybody lies and for lesser things
i don 't have the strength
for three days it 's possible
i 'm afraid to see that apartment where i was so happy
we can 't stay here all night
let 's go to the UNknown
pierre must be sleeping in his cabin
soon he UNknown l be waking up in the middle of the ocean
it will be a sunny morning with UNknown flying
he UNknown l be happy
he UNknown l cry out for you
oh not for too long
he UNknown l be distracted by everything around him
i UNknown l keep getting further away into the mist
what are you thinking ?
if you don 't want to think go to bed
is that for me ?
no it 's for the manager
henri i 'd like another cognac
you UNknown e drunk enough
okay i UNknown l get one
i can 't believe mario isn 't at the UNknown
i UNknown l try to call him again
waiter if that lady tries to leave let me know right away
yes it 's me again !
i 'm not shouting !
yes i want to contact the ship !
subtitles by UNknown and UNknown
please make sure it 's the right amount
it 's always right but never enough
mrs UNknown the boy UNknown
his mother had mailed us to say that he will not be able to continue his studies
one student less for you this month
i wish i find the life that i UNknown e lost
i wish to find the light that i UNknown e lost
dreams seem like an illusion
i don 't trust my illusion anymore
i can 't find the moment that i want to live in
but i imagine it every moment
here you go have a nice day
i wish i find the life that i UNknown e lost
i wish to find the light
this is not working that i UNknown e lost
memories are deeply UNknown in the mind
why do the moments feel on a UNknown ?
what 's the UNknown that i feel in my eyes ?
i can 't find the moment that i want to live in
but i imagine it every moment
it 's somewhere that doesn 't exist
it 's somewhere that doesn 't exist
i will give the money back
i just need some time
how was your day ?
i thought you must be tired
that 's why i prepared soup and vegetable noodles
you won 't have to cook
don 't you dare touch me
i 'm not a bad man UNknown
i 'm just going through a bad phase
and there 's someone that 's been supporting you
in this bad phase and that 's me
at every step at every phase
but your goodness makes me realise my embarrassment
your goodness makes me realise it
i was thinking UNknown there 's one way to solve our problems
there 's just the two of us living in such a big house
we don 't need all this space
what if we sell it and buy a smaller house ?
i mean we UNknown l get more money after selling this
and i UNknown l invest that money in my business
i will not sell this house rajiv
this is the only UNknown left of my mom and dad
i won 't sell it
ls it really about your mom and dad or don 't you trust me anymore ?
i UNknown e already given you all the money that i had
and you lost everything in your business
i UNknown e nothing left other than this house
it 's my only security
you feel more secure in your house than with your husband
hi i 'm mrs UNknown UNknown
i 'm sorry please come in
well if i may say you also look lndian because i 'm an lndian too
it so strange we stay so close but never met each other
i was making some tea with ginger
be careful it 's really hot
i was at work and UNknown was at school
she slipped on the stairs and fell really badly and she couldn 't even get up and call us
she lay there until UNknown returned home
then he called me and we rushed her to the hospital
i 'm so sorry mrs smith
it 's my fault for putting too much varnish on the stairs
my husband is serving in the middle east with the royal marines
and i work for 10 hours a day
and now my mother in law can 't fetch UNknown from the violin classes
and the treatment the cost for UNknown and amongst these we can 't afford UNknown 's violin classes
what if i come here and teach him ?
i 'm not asking you for money
why are you doing all this for us ?
UNknown is very talented mrs smith
just like a student requires a good teacher
a teacher needs a good student as well
as far as money is concerned
who doesn 't need money ?
but the desire to make my student a successful musician is far greater
you can take the girl out of lndia
but you cannot take lndia out of the girl
rajiv i was thinking we UNknown e such a big house
why don 't we rent out a part of the house ?
this way we UNknown l have some income every month and
the rent and the money from my violin classes will be adequate for you to invest in your UNknown programme
and we can make our ends meet
what do you think ? whatever you wish
lndian couple and fort UNknown scotland seeks an lndian single male or female self employed with clear UNknown legitimate paperwork to lease a portion of a picturesque and comfortable house
ls this the right address ?
what do you do for a living ?
there 's a local pub close by i perform there
it 's a part time job
i do part time job to fulfil my UNknown dreams
and i practise part time
i want to be a part of the royal phil UNknown solo
it 's a very difficult exam
three hundred pounds per month
and 1 1 2 years rent in advance
then i will have to sing some extra songs
actually there 's a lot of difference between a house and a home
lf we can find our country men our food our god our food everything far from our country
then it becomes a home
and a home is invaluable
what do you think ?
he seems like a good man
think about it once more UNknown
we 'r e letting an unknown man stay in our house and we don 't know much about him
there 's a lot of suspense
so shall i call it a deal ?
like i said 1 1 2 years rent in advance and you UNknown l have to sign a lease contract
it is exactly UNknown pounds
but why are you giving this to me ?
it is for your business
this house as well as this money is yours
and who knows one day i may end up being your paying guest
please let 's not fight
please forget about the past
UNknown i don 't deserve your love
i am very poor ; i am unemployed
there are two types of people in the world
one who like this first piece of music
and the other who like the second piece of music
you think emotionally and not UNknown
ln a crowd too you feel lonely
you don 't believe in happiness
and there is some pain that you are hiding from the world
i don 't know if you are right or not
but i am definitely late
so this is your room
it is very cold and the heating is automatic
so please don 't UNknown with the controls
it is forbidden to drink take drugs and especially to bring girls here
and yes if you need anything then he is the caretaker here
i don 't know what pain you are hiding
but i know this much that i will never allow you to ever be unhappy
possible someone must have dropped this here
this song is dedicated to my friends
i don 't know why my feet are staggering ?
i try to stop but they won 't stop
i have never experienced such UNknown
i don 't know what to do what to say
i never dreamt this would ever happen
what has happened to me
are you UNknown it too ?
this beat is really thumping
now get your body pumping
i feel i have just experienced eternal happiness
i feel as if i am in love
i wonder why i feel everything to be new
i think something has happened to me
what is wrong with me ?
do you know about it ?
this beat is really thumping
now get your body pumping
this beat and this sound
ls making me go round
all i know this beat and this sound
ls making me go round
shake to the beat now
let the beat repeat now
c 'm on move your feet now oh my love
life is so short but where do you care ?
every moment just passes by
we all are trapped in time
we have UNknown to do with this we are strangers
this beat is really thumping
now get your body pumping
what has happened to me
are you UNknown it too ?
this beat is really thumping
i want to sit behind
i 'm in no hurry to go home
he is a good boy
UNknown you know my name is mrs rajiv UNknown
and she is mr UNknown UNknown
because the house where you stay
she earns money as well
he doesn 't do anything
i should be a loyal wife
because she wears the pants and i wear the skirt and the blouse
you know she and i sleep in one room on one bed
but there is a great wall of china between us
no love only a barrier
oh this is like a song
no love only a barrier
okay brother i am going to my private hell
thank you for today night
come we will once again become strangers
a drama of a happy family
the drama of a husband and a wife
it 's an early dawn but the darkness is not ending
understand this that the fear of darkness is keeping the dawn at bay
what rajiv did today was not new for you
but you are feeling bad because he did this in front of me
lf you don 't mind shall i ask you one personal question ?
this is your house your car and your money
then why do you tolerate rajiv 's behaviour ?
i don 't understand what your fault is
UNknown it is my fault
after marrying me rajiv wanted to return to lndia
but i did not want to leave my house and go
at that time he changed his decision because of me
understand this that in some way or the other l am responsible for his condition today
he sacrificed his happiness for me
not for your happiness but he has done this for his own happiness
what do you mean ?
UNknown do you know ; you are like that old man who wants to run with a lot more burden than he can carry
don 't you think you are tired of all this ?
don 't you think you should erase this false smile from your face ?
don 't you think you need a shoulder to cry on ?
don 't you want to weep ?
don 't you wish to laugh ?
don 't you wish to be happy ?
don 't you wish to live ?
come and commit the sin of loving me
i will never care for my heart or god
have it before it becomes cold
my head feels as if it is about to burst
this morning is not at all good
i have a headache and that too a severe one
last night you drank a lot
i hope nothing UNknown happened last night
what do you mean ?
i mean i hope i didn 't UNknown after getting drunk
i don 't even remember what happened last night
we were in the club you were singing
and then directly i got up in the morning
anyway today i have an important presentation
these are two three rings these bangles and a few ornaments
that 's all i have
what is all this ?
i cannot return the rent that you had given me
so you keep my ornaments in return
but please go away from here
what happened last night was not right
lf you stay here i fear i may again commit the same mistake
it is not wrong to love someone
for me it is wrong
i am a married woman
a marriage which turns into a bondage is not called a marriage
UNknown this marriage may be a bondage but now this is my life
this is the truth of my life
how did you hurt yourself ?
i 'm asking you rajiv
at least look at me
i left home yesterday morning
i didn 't return home in the evening for dinner
i stayed out the entire night
UNknown ask my caring wife did she call me even once did she inquire about me ?
it 's not phoney rajiv
i had a talk with the doctor
there are no serious injuries
so there 's nothing to worry
everything will be fine in two three days
i UNknown e to fill up the insurance form
UNknown is there alcohol in the blood report ?
and how did this accident occur ?
forget it UNknown you won 't be able to hear it if i say it
UNknown i don 't have the money to pay the hospital bills
last night rajiv had too much in the pub with his friends
and then he spent the night with a prostitute in a hotel
ln the morning she found out that he doesn 't have money
you know these girls do all this for money
that 's why because he had no money that girl had him beaten up by the hotel people
please UNknown fill this form
i don 't think i can do it
where are you taking me ?
what 's going on UNknown ?
just come don 't waste time
have you gone crazy UNknown ?
are you happy now ?
do you know what i saw today ?
i saw that you can 't see your courage shattering
but people want to break your courage
that 's why i stole your fear
but people are not letting you smile
that 's why i stole your tears
you want to be happy
that 's why i stole your sorrows
your torments your problems your complaints everything
i stole everything and filled it in these balloons
as you came closer life seemed more beautiful
as you 'r e close to me every happiness seems true
ln my emotions in my feelings
you dwell in my breath as well
you UNknown e filled my eyes with tears of joy
you filled my destiny with ever lasting happiness
why does my heart feel so lively ?
who has entered my life ?
who can it be ?
you seem familiar to my heart
ln my emotions in my feelings
you dwell in my breath as well
as you 'r e close to me every happiness seems true
moments seem to pass by
time seems to fly by
there was a UNknown in my heart
my dreams seem to soar high
the paths seem to have found its destination
ln my emotions in my feelings
you dwell in my breath as well
as you came closer life seemed more beautiful
as you 'r e close to me every happiness seems true
ln my emotions in my feelings
you dwell in my breath as well
i thought you would make me weaker
but you UNknown e become my strength UNknown
whenever i 'm with you l feel i can face the entire world
i 'm always with you UNknown
lf we keep meeting secretly we UNknown l be caught someday
and then the world will turn your strength into your weakness
what did you say ?
what did you say ?
i came here just for her sake
i left my dad 's well settled business for her sake
i UNknown e been here living UNknown just for her
and she she 's talking about leaving me
you did all that for us
you wanted to marry me as well
it 's not about marriage it 's about divorce
i could UNknown e left you in the condition you were
you 'r e the reason for my plight
what else do i UNknown e left except for my house ?
you UNknown e lost everything
i 'm also a human being
don 't i have the right to live ?
you don 't have the right to live happily after ruining my life UNknown leave the room
what do you think ?
what do you think ?
i UNknown l stay in plight and you UNknown l have a UNknown time
do anything you want ?
hire any lawyer you want ?
but i won 't divorce you at any cost
you will never be able to walk out on me
i will never let you walk out on me
what happened ? l slipped
hit my head against the table and
did rajiv find out ?
he 's drunk and unconscious
how will he know ?
i UNknown e talked to my friend there
he 's got me a job in a club and also a house to stay
rajiv won 't be able to find us there
i 'm really sorry because of me
sign on these papers then we UNknown l leave
what papers are these ?
i UNknown e talked to a real estate agent
he 's ready to buy your house and give you the money
come on UNknown just think
we 'r e eloping from this house
once we leave he can do anything he wants with the house
lf he wants he UNknown l prove you 'r e dead
and legally being your husband the entire property will belong to him
and presume that he can 't prove that you 'r e dead he UNknown l find other tenants
and then if you go back to claim your property
you UNknown l have to spend all your life fighting in court
i think you 'r e right
i know what you 'r e saying is right
but my heart doesn 't seem to agree
UNknown this just isn 't my house it 's a UNknown of my parents
i UNknown e spent my entire life in this house
this house is my family
UNknown you don 't understand
i do understand UNknown but do we have to do this now ?
UNknown we don 't have time please understand
UNknown i 'm not a child
i know you 'r e thinking about our interest
but it 's not easy for rajiv to prove that i 'm dead
and then sooner or later we UNknown l come back to this house and
you 'r e eloping with me though you 'r e married
and you 'r e talking about coming back
how will you come back ?
have you gone mad ?
UNknown i don 't want to sign on these papers here at this time
you 'r e one of those people who always think about their own benefit and loss
you 'r e selfish what did you say ?
rajiv left everything he had and stayed back here for you
that house made of stone bricks and sand is much more important for you
when i met you i felt there 's someone in this world
now i UNknown e understood that i was ignorant
where are you going ?
back to the house made of bricks stones and sand that understand me more than you
are you leaving ? i was leaving it
but now i 'm going back
hello he 's killed my husband
now he 's going to kill me
he 's going to kill me
he 's killed my husband
what are you doing in my bedroom ?
that is the difference between you and me
i think you should leave
when you wish you call me and when you wish you just tell me to go
this is not fair mrs UNknown
it is not that i don 't love you but
but you love this house more
you you don 't understand UNknown
this house is not just a concrete building for me
there is a saying in english
you can fool some people all the time
you can fool all the people sometime
but you can 't fool all the people all the time
i couldn 't sleep all night
i kept thinking that the girl for whom i was willing to leave everything that girl deserted me ?
mrs UNknown there are two kinds of lovers in this world
one who destroy themselves by drinking
and the other who destroy the one who destroyed them
it is your bad luck and my good luck
that i am the second type of a lover
mrs UNknown i want this house
you snatched my happiness from me
now i will snatch your happiness from you
lf in these 36 hours if you don 't come to me and sign
these documents i will tell your husband where how and when everything happened between us
UNknown you are mind blowing
oh oh oh my god UNknown
this UNknown is the biggest comedian
his jokes he has the UNknown jokes
i am a little tired
i think i UNknown l sleep
tomorrow night at nine they are going to show my favourite horror film on the television
ghost of the betrayed lover
it is a very terrifying film
i have to track this sequence
rajiv i committed a very grave mistake
i have rajiv i have deceived you
l l had an affair with UNknown
loneliness solitude isolation and helplessness
rajiv there are many excuses
the fact is my resolve weakened
rajiv l l am your culprit rajiv
you can punish me the way you wish
what have we done ?
we decided to live life together
but we never realized when we got UNknown
i 'm sorry rajiv no
you scoundrel i will not spare you
i will not spare you
rajiv come away from here
do you hear me ?
rajiv please control rajiv !
who the hell he thinks he is ?
rajiv don 't do anything
mr and mrs UNknown !
can you hear me ?
mr and mrs UNknown for tonight consider this house as yours
because tomorrow i will deal such a blow to you and your house that you will beg for mercy
i had come to this house but now you will go away from here
mr and mrs UNknown i want this house
because your happiness lies in this house
and i wish to snatch your happiness from you
the contract is water tight with hardly an exit clause
there must be some way to throw him out of the house
what if we say he is a nuisance ?
that would be difficult to prove
you have only two options
one if you can prove that he is doing something illegal
we can 't prove any such thing right now
and second ? sell the house and pay him off
that 's not an option
we UNknown l never sell this house
please see the front end of the door
there is that big scratch going down at the back
yes can i help you officer ?
ls this your car ?
yes it is but may i know what is it about ?
have you lent it to a friend ?
no just me and my wife
mr UNknown i 'm afraid i UNknown l have to ask you to come to the police station with us
there is a warrant of your arrest
but what have i done ?
i UNknown l let the chief inspector explain that at the station
would you like to come with us please ?
you ? ls everything all right ?
what is the matter ?
what 's going on ?
last night these photographs were clicked by UNknown cameras
ls this your car ?
yes this is my car but what is all this ?
late last night the driver from this car and with this car in public property damaged three street lights one bus stop and two storm drains
but how is this possible ?
our car was parked outside our house
well UNknown even you understand this that the car does not run on its own
and your husband gave a statement in front of the arresting officers that this car belongs to you and it was never missing or stolen and you were present
now you tell me what can we do ?
what can the police do in this matter ?
and most of all we have these UNknown pictures also
yes but it can also be possible that someone else must have done this ?
you mean to say that one man UNknown comes into your house late night steals the car keys and creates a chaos in the entire city ?
and he again comes and keeps the car back in place and once again goes into the house and keeps the car keys
who will do this ?
and why will he do this ?
no one will do such a thing
i know that you are good people
and possible that you are not connected to these UNknown
ln such a situation i can help you in only one way
lf you pay for all the damage that has been caused l will see to it that they don 't take any action against you
i can take care of that
how much will we have to pay ?
i am really sorry UNknown
from where will we get so much money ?
that lawyer told us that there is a clause in the lease that if UNknown does some illegal business then we can throw him out of the house
he damaged public and private property
what is this if not illegal ?
why didn 't you tell the inspector that UNknown has done all this
why were you quiet ?
lf i would tell the inspector that UNknown has done all this then what would she think ?
wouldn 't she ask me why would a tenant steal the landlord 's car ?
why will he break the law ?
what would i answer her ?
UNknown why does he want to ruin us ?
should i UNknown our image to save this house ?
rajiv what have i done ?
i 'm really very sorry
it is not your mistake that you drifted away from me in search of happiness
i am to be blamed
i was waiting for you both
i have written a new song for my show
both of you hear and tell me how it is ?
mr and mrs UNknown were sleeping
one thief came in and stole their car
the thief UNknown UNknown he damaged quite a few things
mr UNknown will have to pay for that
he will be in trouble
the police arrested mr and mrs UNknown
i heard they will charge a lot ?
how did you like it ?
keep 2 4 security guards
this is a vast property
how much can you take care ?
a tap may remain open in the bathroom
the fuse may blow off in some bedroom
the fridge may stop working
something may fall on the carpet
the glass of the window UNknown may break sometime
there can a scratch on the piano
how much will you take care ?
how much ever you trouble us play any game
tell anyone what i like ?
so shall i go and tell everyone that i had seen your wife UNknown
you are late in showing your UNknown
he wants you to react rajiv
we didn 't just let him inside our house but in our home
we UNknown l have to get him out of this home at any cost
but what will you do ?
the game that he 's playing with us
i know how to play that game too
tonight when he leaves for his show you keep a watch on him
ls it yes or is it no ?
tell me what your decision is
your torments seem like punishment i UNknown e reached my limits
i keep awake even in my slumber
i can 't sleep a wink
i feel i know i feel
she 's driving me crazy
i feel i know i feel
she 's driving me crazy
i feel i know i feel

she 's driving me crazy
my eyes seek out for you
where 's the path leading to you ?
she 's driving me crazy
it 's difficult to spend nights
she 's driving me crazy
you just need to call the police and tell them you saw him taking drugs
i UNknown e hidden a huge quantity of drugs the police will feel he 's a drug dealer
with your permission i 'd like to say a few lines
fine even if i don 't have your permission l UNknown l say these few lines
the plan you devised was really good
the plan you devised was really good
but it was UNknown for me
the plan you devised was really good
but it was UNknown for me
think twice before calling the police
and take a peak below the carpet
you cannot meet your husband
what do they say ?
now be a good girl and sign on the property papers
lf you think you can scare me
let 's not worry about what i think
you should worry about what the police will think
because now i UNknown e hidden the drugs in this house
he UNknown l be shifted from this jail to the central jail
just think UNknown your husband will be rotting in jail
and you UNknown l be staying in this palace
your concept of UNknown will be UNknown
on one hand the house and on the other your husband
listen to me sign on it dear
please stop it stop this singing
fine i UNknown l sign it
but just leave me alone
lf you want to talk to your house in solitude

and your time starts now
and by the way i UNknown e the keys to set rajiv free
i UNknown e signed it
your love has won dear
please stop it stop this singing
you UNknown e two minutes
and your time starts now
you won 't understand the strength in the concept of UNknown UNknown
please don 't embarrass me
are you sure everything is fine ?
it can be any of the two
either i UNknown l be back in two hours
or i UNknown l be back by evening
it will be only the latter one
they 'r e going to love your UNknown design
call me as soon as you finish your meeting
maybe i UNknown e seen you before
it was such a nice plan
like a fool you hid the drugs in the piano
she found out in a minute
you 'r e too strict
i UNknown e only three days
lf i don 't return their money this time they won 't send me to the hospital but kill me
that means i UNknown l have to come up there to retrieve my money
the joke is not on me it 's on you
you couldn 't even get a girl to sign
what can i do ?
you UNknown e chosen such stubborn wife
she 's UNknown than you
she didn 't agree when i played a charade of love
she didn 't agree when i tried to blackmail her
now i 'm making your life hell but she isn 't ready to sign even now
i can play with someone 's heart
i can play with someone 's mind
i can play with someone 's body
but not with someone 's life
the property is worth two million pounds
you got me with greed
but how will i know its night

as soon as i get my money you UNknown l get your share
he story has changed slightly
what do you mean ?
i mean when your wife found out that this scoundrel is murdering her on the orders of her scoundrel husband
she thought that her husband is bigger rascal compared to her lover
and before dying she transferred the house in my name
what nonsense are you UNknown ?
i 'm not UNknown nonsense it 's the truth
lf you don 't believe me see it with your own eyes
jack and jill lived up the hill
jack was greedy killed jill 's spouse
now jack is homeless and i UNknown e his house
it 's a new nursery rhyme please don 't mind
i 'm sure you can teach singing to the inmates in jail
UNknown was right about one thing
i 'm a bigger rascal than you
what can i do ?
you UNknown e chosen such stubborn wife
she 's UNknown than you
she didn 't agree when i played a charade of love
she didn 't agree when i tried to blackmail her
now i 'm making your life hell
but she isn 't ready to sign even now
i might be jailed but i will take you along
i UNknown e lost i UNknown e lost
you 'r e the winner of this competition for scoundrels
but you lack common sense
just think if your wife can gift me such a big house
why will i kill her ?
that was a shock of a lifetime
mrs UNknown i UNknown e fulfilled my promise
your culprit is standing right before you
now you can take any decision you want
you can live with me in this house if you want
just allow me to stay in this house tonight
until then i UNknown l take care of the body of the winner of the scoundrel competition
hello lf this is a hoax please know that this call is being traced
it is a criminal offence
it 's okay it 's okay it 's me it 's me
don 't cry it 's alright
he 's killed my husband now he 's trying to kill me
who killed your husband ?
he must still have the papers that he made you sign UNknown
UNknown UNknown sat on a wall
thought he was smarter than all
UNknown UNknown had a great fall
will now spend his life in a prison hall
these papers prove that he killed your husband to snatch his property
1 2 3 4 very nice
please continue i UNknown l be back
come UNknown the violin 's been waiting for you
there 's no need for that
the week is still not over
it 's not a cheque
all the calls made to the police control room are recorded
you called at 10 30 in the night
and said someone has murdered your husband
and your life is in danger
there 's also a UNknown report in it
and according to that report your husband died at around 2 o UNknown lock in the night
both these reports are evidence to prove that you had already informed us about your husband 's death before he died
there were three copies of this report
i UNknown e already burnt two
what are you talking about ?
my brother joseph and i have had two families
well let 's just say it didn 't work out too well
but over the years we made ourselves a new one
and it was to this family all of you
a family is something that joseph and i needed
a world that never understood or appreciated
there are others like us out there
in the shadows in the light
each UNknown for meaning in a world
that won 't accept them for who they really are
they like us are blessed
and they like us struggle with finding their place
from those who would harm them
and keep them from their destiny
every one of them deserves a chance
to be who they really are
they will come to our side
and they will find their way home
and all who have gathered will be strong
and all who have gathered
i say it 's time
we found our way back home again
you must be my new roommate
yeah i guess i am
the school um they wouldn 't really
otherwise i would have UNknown you on facebook
oh that 's my fault
i always check those little privacy boxes for some reason
i did that same thing with my ap classmate 's profile
after i got a b plus in ap physics
are you on UNknown com ?
no i 'm not in advanced UNknown
i got my g e d
it 's not because i dropped out or anything
and you got into this school with a g e d ?
what do your parents do ?
uh my mom breeds championship show dogs
and my dad works for the government
so that 's how you got in with a g e d
well you UNknown l probably place
he only takes 35 students a semester
and the UNknown test is today at 1 00
you get in and it pretty much
sets the whole UNknown into motion you know ?
so um what 's your plan for graduate school ?
i don 't really have one
guess it 's kind of why i 'm here
no you have to go to college with a plan
how are you gonna find our future without a map ?
see i call this my trajectory
this is me in three years graduating UNknown UNknown UNknown
in UNknown UNknown UNknown law this is me in eight years
and this is me in 12 years
being sworn in as the youngest governor in u s history
wow you really thought that through
don 't you think it 's time you put childish things
behind you and thought this through yourself claire ?
i mean don 't let g e d be a lifestyle choice
i UNknown l tell you what
if you want i UNknown l help you make your own trajectory
dispatch this is unit 5 9
we are 12 blocks out we 'r e on it
we 'r e on it
look at this parking lot
we 'r e not going anywhere in this mess
oh you 'r e right
what are you doing ?
i 'm gonna hoof it
we 'r e 12 blocks away
you UNknown l never make it
UNknown i grew up out here
you know if you pass this test
then we 'r e gonna be in class together
please don 't think of this as a competition okay ?
this is a UNknown test for UNknown algebra 170
35 of you geniuses will be lucky enough
to get in this class
the rest you can try next semester
you each have 45 minutes
is this a joke ?
i know it 's so easy
where are you going ?
this class isn 't for me
so that pregnant woman ?
the pregnant woman 's name is UNknown
named them UNknown and katie
hey they 'r e still up in UNknown
you know you should stop by
they 'd like to thank you in person
you single UNknown saved three lives
well you could have fooled me
what 's going on with you ?
if i would have showed up 30 seconds later
that woman her babies they 'd be dead
it 's too close man
i UNknown e gotta be faster
dude you got there faster than UNknown possible
if i was a religious man i 'd think it was a miracle
where are you going ?
we just got off a double
yeah i know but james is sick
i figured i 'd cover for him
too late jackson 's already covering
dude there 's a life outside this place
now me and some of the guys are going out
UNknown 's still open come with us
i take it you UNknown e seen the paper this morning
all four worked in building 26 UNknown 's men
and we both know it 's tracy strauss
i 'm sure it won 't be long
which is exactly why you 'r e gonna stop
dragging your feet and pull the trigger
it 's been six weeks noah
i UNknown e given you time to put your personal life in order
and nathan says you 'r e avoiding his phone calls
by nathan you mean UNknown right ?
we UNknown e been over this noah
it 's all working exactly as planned
we had no other choice
matt parkman had to turn UNknown into nathan
and as i recall you were in on it
i made an emotional decision
because i didn 't want to see you lose your son
for 50 years the company avoided emotions for good reason
i can barely look him in the eye
knowing who 's under that skin
just do your job to get the company up and running
you 'r e supposed to be the man with the plan remember ?
i 'm not sure i 'm that guy anymore
because i UNknown e lost my family angela
if you UNknown l excuse me
today is claire 's first day of college
and i 'm already late which doesn 't help the situation
it appears tracy strauss just paid you a visit
what i can 't figure out is how she survived
i put a bullet in her myself
i 'm gonna take a wild guess
that your being here isn 't a co UNknown
i 'm here to offer a solution to our mutual problem
you and i kill tracy strauss before she kills us
i 'm thinking you 'r e next on her list
that makes us both wanted men
so what are you doing here ?
you ought to be hiding under a rock somewhere
just because the government stopped hunting these people doesn 't mean i have
i hear you and the UNknown you 'r e going back into business to do just that
i 'm not in that business anymore
what did you do grow a conscience ?
guys like us we don 't start over
i 'm not like you
she 's coming back for you
you know that right ?
i guess you 'r e on your own
you made the right call
UNknown are a very subversive group
i used to be one of them
i i tried out but i didn 't make the team
they said that my cheers sounded more like UNknown
yeah that 's not good
uh i 'm gretchen berg
so where are you from ?
kind of all over the place
uh been in southern california for a while
wait you 'r e not that claire bennet are you ?
which claire bennet would that be ?
murder at union wells in odessa claire bennet
you heard about that ?
a UNknown in texas gets her head UNknown off at the homecoming game ?
yeah i UNknown e heard about that
they 'd probably let you do it over the phone
i changed my name for a while
oh why did you change it back ? UNknown UNknown i wanted to be claire bennet again
i uh i have to take care of something
what have you done to me mom ?
took me a half hour to get here
i 'm sorry where are my manners ?
you look lovely as usual
miss UNknown we 'r e here
what have you done to me ?
took me a half an hour to get here
where are my manners ?
i 'm worried about the company that 's all
i 'm worried that noah might be UNknown
he 's been very distracted lately
i UNknown l talk to him don 't worry
do i like sushi ?
you 'r e the one who had a craving for UNknown
life it 's all about new UNknown
you know these last couple of weeks
i UNknown e been taking stock of a lot of things
i feel like there 's a lot of
i don 't know mom
it 's like when i look back on my life
it just seems like it 's not my life i 'm looking back on
happens when you hit 40
along with all sorts of other unpleasant surprises
i 'm being serious mom
look at the person i UNknown e been the kind of father
the kind of son to you
i have been a jackass
but i 'm gonna change all that
i 'm gonna UNknown with everybody in my life
who 's important and this time
you have a big important UNknown life
and it 's bound to get confusing
and a man your age starts to feel his own UNknown
i don 't feel mortal
it 's UNknown crisis that 's all this is
you go out and you get yourself a big expensive sports car
and a younger woman with questionable morals
i 'm gonna get the phone okay ?
i told you never to call me
what kind of problem ?
that thing you did six weeks ago
you mean when you and bennet strong armed me
into playing god that thing ?
i think UNknown 's beginning to emerge again
that 's because he is UNknown
no you made UNknown go away
when you turned him into my son
i saw you do it
okay then why the hell are you calling me ?
because you need to fix it
you need to patch it up UNknown it
whatever it is you do
you go back into his mind and erase his memory again
that 's what you do
no not anymore i stopped
look ever since that day
i have felt like something got inside of me
and i can 't get it out
i started seeing things and i i UNknown e stopped okay ?
there 's no such thing as out detective
not for people like us
i 'm telling you UNknown could emerge at any minute
are you telling me you are not willing to fix our problem ?
this is not our problem
and honestly i 'm sure she could be
yeah i 'm sorry i 'm late
i was having a little problem with my car
and annie was just um catching me up
so um consider yourself served
so annie was catching you up
maybe you can uh take that algebra class next semester
but see that is probably the least interesting part of my day
i was recognized as a survivor of the homecoming massacre back in odessa
you know maybe changing your name back to bennet wasn 't such a great idea after all
but they say college is for UNknown yourself
i don 't want to pretend to be anyone but me
i just wanna be claire bennet daughter of noah bennet
you know annie asked me today what my dad did for a living
i told her you worked for the government but still
and i like telling the truth
maybe not the whole truth
show me who he is
you wanted to see me sam
i have a favor to ask of you edgar
can 't you send someone else this time ?
i 'd take it as a compliment to your unique skills
well what you said this morning about redemption i 'm hoping that 's possible
yes well i left out the part about vengeance
that 's where he comes in
but i UNknown e only killed when i UNknown e absolutely had to
the line 's been crossed
they crossed it not us
i need you to go to him get the compass back
and the kill the son of a bitch
that 's what joseph would have wanted
you 'r e just number five
or it used to be
is it still lucky ?
i haven 't decided yet
i saw you break into a thousand pieces and yet here you are
that is a neat trick
it wasn 't a trick
and then all those pieces of me came floating back together with one UNknown thought
okay now see that 's the part that i don 't get
because i don 't think that you 'r e really a killer
that 's not who you are
no that 's all i am
you took the rest away from me
UNknown said that he wouldn 't stop until i was killed
what if i could make it so that UNknown wasn 't interested in you anymore ?
why do you want to do this for me ?
20 years of UNknown and UNknown and i never helped a single one of you
maybe we 'r e both looking for redemption
what do you say ?
i bet you wish it was that easy
i got your phone call
i 'm gonna kill her
even if i have to suck her up in a wet UNknown to do it
she murdered four of my men
i 'm recommending that you let this thing go
you said guys like us never start over
i 'm offering you a chance to do just that
consider it a permanent vacation
i want you to forget about tracy strauss
well we all want things bennet
get back to you when i can thanks
look i UNknown e left you
i UNknown e left you three messages
you need to call me back
something 's happening to me and i think you 'r e the only person who 's gonna understand what it is
who the hell are you ?
you know exactly who i am
they sent you to get it back
what did you say ?
you took something from us
now i 'm gonna get it back
i 'm sorry if i UNknown you out with that whole uh murder at union wells thing
i just it was so scandalous and i got excited
it was just weird talking about it because i was never allowed to talk about it before
so what you pretended like it didn 't happen ?
no i just kept trying to start my life over and i thought i could take what i liked about who i was and leave all the other stuff behind
hey come on over here !
you have been served come on !
she 's been UNknown the thing all night
that would be my roommate
come on we 'r e up
i was gonna play with gretchen
does gretchen know how to play ?
your opponent 's supposed to raise your game
well since neither one of us know what we 'r e doing
we UNknown l be on even playing fields
that 's all for now
are we really going to stop moving after all these years ?
i know you 'r e weak
i think we found someone who can help us fix the past
i need you to send me back
hey i didn 't see you leave the party
guess you 'r e still there
UNknown are you hiding again ?
i want my body back
you put him down please
he looks pretty scared huh ?
can you say freaking out ?
i don 't i don 't understand
how are you even here ?
i 'm part of you matt
whatever you did to me i held on
and now i 'm inside your head
so you 'r e not real ?
then how could i be holding your little boy ?
not until you give me what i want
you did something to me to my mind
that 's why i 'm here
tell me what you did what did you put in my body ?
i thought i heard him crying that 's all
what 's going on with you ?
i 'm just tired i guess
i must have UNknown the wrong number
no no this is tracy
i didn 't do it
what have you got to lose UNknown ?
do i know you ?
and i think we 'r e gonna be great friends
did your roommate express any suicidal thoughts feelings of being overwhelmed
no if anything she had too much self esteem
that 's not the impression she left in her suicide note
this was on her pillow
it may have been something you overlooked
no i distinctly remember being impressed with how crisp her UNknown was
and that there wasn 't a suicide note
would you get them out of here ?
you said she was an UNknown ?
look even an UNknown can 't write a suicide note after she 's dead
this was not a suicide
why would someone want to murder your roommate ?
isn 't that your job ?
thanks for your help miss bennet
how did you know that ?
i have a gift UNknown
what are you doing here ?
i 'm thinking it has something to do with that young man
yes but i cannot interfere
because this is where it starts
how i become the master of time and space
if i interfere i will never become a hero
i won 't save the UNknown
and new york will explode
but i bet there 's some butterflies
i mean why not make this trip worthwhile ?
no you can never change the past
sometimes if you want to change one thing
that 's all you do
you have a rare gift UNknown to right the wrongs of your life
isn 't there anything else you 'd care to fix ?
that was all my fault
i bumped into UNknown and made him spill his drink
all over kimiko 's favorite dress
that is the reason why she started to hate him
now 's your chance to make them happy
i have a code to never change the aah !
there are things in this world that are wrong UNknown
you can make them right
if you master these skills you and i will have a bright future together
you just need to take a chance
UNknown and i we were just talking in the hall
the next thing i know he 's dead
and this guy is on me
i mean this whole water thing
it just it kicked in on instinct
what are you doing here tracy ?
i wanted you to leave UNknown to me
i couldn 't just let it go
i didn 't know if i could trust you to deal with him
when i got here i saw that you did what you promised
he didn 't know me
so i figured just live and let live
and as i was leaving this guy
the guy with the knives ?
you have no idea why he 'd want to kill UNknown ?
i think i heard him say he was looking for something
i don 't know maybe it was revenge
UNknown made a lot of enemies
they were all to the stomach
if it were me and i was looking for revenge
i 'd go for the UNknown
or the UNknown artery or the heart
no i think you heard right
i think the killer was looking for something
and i think i found it
that 's a good question
come on UNknown man you can do it
oh look at you !
god he usually takes so much longer to warm up to strangers
oh roy 's not a stranger
he 's been delivering water to us since UNknown was born
i can 't believe it 's been that long
listen the heating unit on your cooler is busted
no your name is mrs parkman
look when i delivered water we were professional
that 's not the point
he was here i wasn 't and i 'm just a little pissed
hey you 'r e tired
you haven 't been sleeping properly
well i UNknown e been snoring a lot less so
i 'm worried about you
i i got a lead on this huge drug ring
and all i need is the name of the UNknown
and if you could read a few minds
yeah but i told you i 'm not UNknown that anymore right ?
i kicked that for good
i know and i 'm proud of you
i 'm just worried that it 's taking a toll
can we talk for a minute ?
so i have water or mustard
so what have you been up to ?
it must be keeping you busy
your mother says she hasn 't seen you in weeks
are you using powers ?
it 's a pretty convenient power
you me my family the company
come on we haven 't exactly been model citizens noah
it 's a pretty heavy burden for one guy
this key opens a safe deposit box in a downtown bank
now the way i figure it the guy that killed UNknown is probably just waiting for whoever shows up with this key
i need a partner on this somebody i can trust
he could jump me just about anywhere
and i 'd never know what hit me
cause he 's super fast and he has a thing for knives
i would never leave you here
annie 's parents came by last night
i thought they should know about the supposed suicide letter
you didn 't say anything did you ?
no but i think they have the right to know don 't you ?
i mean if it were me you would want to know
it 's not your business to tell the parents about the note
let the police handle it
i heard you told the cops that you didn 't see a suicide note
so what do you think murder or UNknown accident ?
uh claire may have been mistaken about the note
did you see one or not ?
well i didn 't at first but it was dark
i mean the girl had a trajectory
who maps out their life for the next 50 years and then throws UNknown out a window ?
so it 's murder right ?
how do we prove it ?
so you think your knife guy 's gonna show ?
i don 't know but it sure makes me feel better having you around
yeah i UNknown l bet
do you mind if i make an observation ?
i think you should seriously consider how you 'r e living your life
where did that come from ?
i saw your apartment the police UNknown all those newspaper articles
you 'r e saving lives and you 'r e keeping track
do any of them know yours ?
it 's not healthy to live alone peter
for years i put my job ahead of my family
and now my kids are off at school and i 'm eating cereal for dinner and a strange man is answering my wife 's phone
my point is i 'm alone
that 's no way to live
here you are mr UNknown
and i UNknown l be right outside when you 'r e finished
yeah we need just another minute
that doesn 't belong to you
how 's he doing ?
i hope it was worth it
i can 't figure out why UNknown thought this was worth dying for
what did you do ?
i didn 't do anything
peter this is a lead
you saw that guy there could be others out there like him
look my life finally makes sense to me
in the last six weeks i have saved 53 people
i 'm with you for what ? an hour and some innocent guy almost gets killed ?
the further i stay away from you and whatever it is that you 'r e doing the happier i 'm gonna be
he almost killed you and me for this
i don 't need for things to get complicated
it UNknown l help me do my job better
the one where i actually save people
i guess this is good bye
i wish you all the luck in the world peter
where did you get those the homicide bookstore ?
is there such a place ?
don 't you think you 'r e going a little overboard ?
and yes i know what UNknown means
well don 't get mad at me for using it in a sentence
have you ever heard of the jump push fall test ?
it 's when cops get a dummy the approximate size and weight of the victim and they throw it out the window to see how it lands
what page is that on ?
look if you fall you go straight down
if you jump you go a little further
all we need is a dummy of the approximate size and weight of annie
you 'r e not serious
maybe we could swipe a cadaver from the medical school
what ? it 's a UNknown crime
let 's not get carried away
maybe but i 'm not trying to be a social UNknown before UNknown
mm the ship 's already sailed claire
so where do we get our hands on a dead body ?
and i 'm feeling confused
uh when i when i used
i didn 't think about what i did to others
it 's been about six weeks or so since i UNknown e seen my body and i want it back
recently uh there have been these uh ghosts
these things have been popping up from my old life and haunting me
do you really think you 'r e gonna stop using your powers ?
i can 't seem to get these images out of my head
you 'r e weak !
you 'r e UNknown !
i bet i could make you use your powers !
i could make you use your powers !
hey buddy are you okay ?
does this guy look okay seriously ?
20 pounds UNknown blood pressure 's through the roof
he 's like a heart attack waiting to happen !
all right let me take a crack at this guy
see if i can get him to talk
now you seemed a little off today at the meeting
no no no no no
come on let 's do this easy all right ?
just two guys talking come on
so we need a name
your UNknown all right ?
you give us that name you keep a clean record
he 's a liar totally lying
why are you looking at my forehead ?
does it say UNknown or something ?
i wasn 't staring at your forehead
you 'r e not getting a name coffee boy
is that all you need matt ?
what the hell are you waiting for ?
it 's got to be floating around in his comical little brain somewhere right ?
i don 't do that anymore
don 't do what anymore ?
because you 'r e addicted ?
who are you talking to ?
just read his mind matt
you know you want to
i could take a nice little chunk out of his skull in the process
what 's the matter with you ?
just give me a name okay ?
why the hell not ?
no wonder your wife is having sex with the water guy
i didn 't say anything
i 'm not talking to you right now
she 's cheated on you once already
and we both know what janice needs is a real man
someone who 's not afraid of power
someone who knows what to do with it
i 'm in control here not the power
UNknown the guy 's name is UNknown
lives in long beach okay ?
have a nice day off ?
i got a lot done
that 's i 'm fine
it smells good where 'd you get it ?
this place called legal sea foods
i got one for you
well how 'd you get it down here ?
that 's the partner i know and love
all available units code three fifth and lexington
just hang on okay ?
oh you know it looks worse than it feels
when you called i figured i owed it to you
hey you know that key inside of UNknown ?
it turns out it led me to a uh broken old compass
your friend with the knives
just came and took it back anyway
you gonna go after him ?
i uh i prefer the old way of doing business one of me one of you
this new way just feels too
dangerous to try to stop them alone
maybe this guy with the knives is like me
just trying to get their life back
maybe the idea isn 't to stop them
why did you call ?
you know i i can 't call my wife
and i didn 't want to worry claire
i 'm i 'm no i get it
you don 't want to be alone
so what 's in the bag ?
um i i have no idea
mmm it 's still warm
looks like you have someone looking out for you
you don 't need to jam it
or else you UNknown l just bust the coil again
it was another banner day
let me walk you out buddy
yeah look thanks for fixing the hot water and all but
look she 's not single anymore
tomorrow you 'r e gonna ask for a new route
and you 'r e never gonna stop by this house again
so i 'm starting a new route guess this is good bye
sorry getting the compass back was a lot harder than i thought
didn 't really get a chance

this is 526 315 79
now times that by 19
that comes up to 10 million plus 1 cent
that is a deal !
now you call the mayor and tell him the price
and you tell him i want 100 thousand and 100 bills you got that
what about the 1 cent ?
now this is not a UNknown contract this is a UNknown that means there 's a time limit on it

yeah we here you loud and clear
well good now you don 't have to tell the cops they don 't tell me how to do it or how it 's going to be !
i UNknown l fucking tell them
don 't you ever ever leave me again or i UNknown l hunt you down and i UNknown l kill you !
what 's your position ?
UNknown 2 we 'r e approaching hostage car from the south tunnel
let 's just write him a check and get it over with
he wants it in cash
we UNknown e been given 1 hour to get the money together 10 million !
where do they get these numbers ?
actually ten 's the limit sir
we just sign a request to the city control he UNknown it to one of our UNknown cash get 's released to the federal reserve
limit at any one time is 10 million
well some idiot with a gun wouldn 't know that
i didn 't know that
well you 'r e very busy sir
how do you know that ?
henry what 's the situation ?
they just killed a hostage
we don 't know they 'r e not sure
they got 18 hostages they say they UNknown l kill more in an hour that 's the time limit
they want you to know
what do we know about them ?
they 'r e not amateurs
they cut out a car stopped a rise in the tunnel they can see us coming a 100 yards either way
how long to get the money together
your not thinking of paying these UNknown are you ?
i 'm thinking of buying time and being ready
call the UNknown tell him we UNknown l pay them
what 's with you and garber huh ?
he 's only had this particular job a couple of weeks
we 'r e gonna suspend him with pay
what 's he being investigated for ?
we went to japan he had a look at some trains and the UNknown is that he took a bribe
not that i know of
yeah i don 't think so
is that what we are ? an enterprise ?
we 'r e an enterprise !
well our little enterprise has begun it 's descent
UNknown 4 what 's your UNknown ?
approximately two minutes from the target
why 's the train called pelham 1 2 3 ?
it comes at pelham bay at 1 23 in the afternoon
how did you end up with this call ?
it 's a lexington avenue train and i got the lexington avenue desk
it came through my desk
can you think of any reason why you would be UNknown ? someone would wanna hurt you ?
as i said it was a coincidence that it came through my desk
did you pick this desk or was it assigned to you ?
i said did you pick this desk or was it assigned to you ?
can i take my coat off ?
doesn 't make any sense !
he 's a big shot
big shot of what ?
rail control he runs things up there
UNknown he did before i went out
dude like that shouldn 't be answering the phone ?
are you sure you don 't have some sort of relationship with him ?
i 'm sure whatever relationship i have with him is better than yours
jerry my friend was killed while you were talking to ryder
so maybe that 's a question you should be asking yourself instead of asking me
i didn 't have anything to do with this
i didn 't say that
this mr garber is an unknown UNknown
that 's right and peoples lives are at stake
so please excuse me if i try to get more comfortable with you okay ?
now with that in mind would you agree to a UNknown search of your house ?
oh shit look at this !
UNknown 2 what is your overall status ?
alright hold your fire until instructed
pelham 1 2 3 can you hear me ?
yeah loud and clear back at ya !
well you know you got 28 minutes so i 'd advise them to make haste
i 'm sure you will
so is your first name walter ?
your name is it walter
what are you doing UNknown trains ?
i thought you were some sort of UNknown big shot ?
i worked for the UNknown today they put me in dispatch and uh
i thought you didn 't believe in bad luck
i said i didn 't believe in fate do you believe in rig contracts for new trains ?
look what we talking about this for ?
i need to know who i 'm dealing with
you need to know who your dealing with ?
yeah i need to know who i 'm dealing with
are you a bad penny !
let me explain something to you
being accused of something is one thing
be guilty of it is something entirely different
you gotta take me through it my man
you gotta tell me from the top
this whole train thing come on
how long did you do that for ?
i drove them over 6 years i went to operations assistant dispatcher
dispatcher i finally ended up
yeah your assistant chief transportation officer or something right ?
and part of my job is to a go out to the manufacturers you know people who build the trains and bid on contracts for the trains
is that where you took your bribe the japanese train
or the canadian train ?
i did not take a bribe alright ?
i was accused of taking a bribe i have not been proven guilty yet
well they haven t said yet i mean they haven 't decided yet
i don 't care what they decide
it don 't matter what !
is this when they UNknown you ?
that 's correct they UNknown me pending the outcome
and now they tying to humiliate you is that right ?
i know how these things work man okay
everything doesn 't seem to appear like what it is but you gotta be completely honest with me man
i don 't know what you 'r e talking about ?
how did you do it ?
look your talking to a catholic man we UNknown e been over innocent before okay
i UNknown e been through all this man so just tell me how did you do it !
