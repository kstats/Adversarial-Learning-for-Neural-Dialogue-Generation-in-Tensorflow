you said that a being in the UNknown cab that was like being in a confessional right ?
what you trying to say ?
that if i get caught i better get used to it ?
no i 'm just wondering maybe your already used to it
i 'm wondering maybe
how the fuck does he know that !
why don 't you tell me garber ?
then we UNknown l both know
after today 's confession your going to find your ass in prison too !
which is my point
i know you know everybody this way when i come up with my own heist plan you know i UNknown l cut you in
i can see i UNknown e inspired you
okay i UNknown e got a story for you
it might help you in prison you wanna hear it ?
we got a minute ?
yeah i 'd like to hear a little story
UNknown so back in the day when i was a high roller
when were you ever a high roller ?
well you know i told you i fed the city breakfast every morning
bacon and eggs ?
iceland is 6 hours from canada
the night club scene is intense and i thought i 'd take this chick to iceland
what 's her name ?
UNknown she was UNknown
she asked what ?
she was an ass model
she did jeans and magazines and shit
anyway it was a fashion week in new york and a
i took her to iceland
UNknown UNknown ass model iceland
you took her to the ice
for 500 they take you on a dogs sledge ride in the UNknown
dogs sleigh ?
right otherwise your always looking at the asshole of the dog in front of you
that would be funny if i get to that part
it 's funny now
shit always hit 's you man !
i didn 't know at the time but it was profound !
i had trouble going to the toilet you know privacy thing and i
i couldn 't take a shit i was scared UNknown literally
so you know what i thought of ?
you thought of the dog !
that 's right
saved my fucking life !
wow that is profound
like today we didn 't know how today was going to start
yeah but do you know how it 's going to end ?
i 'm tired of talking you garber
you got 4 minutes
fucking talk 's shit ?
he 's got a sexy voice man he can be my bitch in prison
where are we ?
get a radio car put in on a motorcycle and get it there
you got 22 seconds garber
alright we just had a little problem over here that 's all
i don 't care !
i don 't think i should lie
tell him the truth
he 's going to make me do it
tell him the truth !
no ! tell him it 's here
it 's here !
get the lady up come on up up !
i think that 's him
ryder listen to me !
we made a mistake it 's my fault !
the cars hit that 's why the
tell him something
ryder one minute it 's going to take
don 't do this for god 's sake !
it was an accident !
ryder listen !
it was an accident ryder !
we made a mistake
come on mother fucker !
do you have a shot ?
that 's your fault !
got an easy shot please advise
it 's accidental discharge
was it ryder ?
shoot any mother fucker that moves !
it 's an order !
shove your orders !
okay now somebody else has to die !
two people maybe all of us !
did you hear me ?
i heard you but you got to understand
the circumstances they 'r e different now for you
you gotta re think this you gotta adapt
no i gave instructions and you know the consequences !
don 't you have a plan b ?
the minute you stop believing me mother fucker !
that 's it !
bring it man !
what 's the point of that huh ?
what 's the point of that
i told you we all owe god a death and now it 's 2 minutes past the deadline
2 minutes ! which means 2 people almost 3 have to go
they have to die
nobody else has to die
i don 't know what you owe god but i can tell you you can 't pay him in cash
you never see a u horn behind a hearse ryder the egyptians tried it it doesn 't work you can 't take the money with you
all this talk of god
i think i need to pray
give me a minute
we have to except heavy casualties on all sides it 's a hard choice but i say make it !
new york city does not have an acceptable casualty rate
now this is your area of UNknown
what do you suggest ?
in my opinion there are people down there who are alive because of him
until we change the rules or hope runs out we should stick with the situation we have now
do what you need to do
from the next station it would take them about 5 minutes to walk it down
10 minutes to walk it down
no no no !
i don 't understand
i mean you
if you bring it i know the cops aren 't bringing it
well you know
220 pounds stick it in a fucking wheel barrow or something
why we discussing weight ?
shouldn 't you be thinking get the fuck outta there ?
okay get the fuck outta there !
or i kill another hostage you got that ?
you got seven minutes buddy boy
you got 6 minutes and 55 seconds check me
do it !
you don 't have to do this
finally somebody got their head out of their ass
what are you doing ?
what do you mean what am i doing ?
i 'm watching the thing
right right listen
i knew it !
after everything all this
i 'm getting ready to get on the helicopter they want me to take the money down to the tunnel
what it is is he know 's i 'm not a cop so he wants me to come down
is it okay if i wait here ?
can i wait here ?
they need me to take the money down there because they know i 'm not a cop and a
you know they saying they might kill somebody
well then somebody has to die
because you can 't
just like i always tell her okay ?
i gotta go
now you listen to me
yeah i 'm listening
milk okay ?
just bring a gallon
i gotta go
you know go in unarmed ?
yes 2 years ago
and the guy with the gun ?
the guy with the gun didn 't have a role for him
with the guy with the gun
it 's nice seeing it from this perspective huh ?
you can see what your fighting for
i love you so much !
did you hear me ?
i can 't really talk right now
all you have to say is yes
it 's alot less than saying i can 't talk
i 'm having a really fucking weird day
oh god !
what kind of guy would you expect to take a model to iceland
for the weekend ?
it 's set up back there you can talk directly to the train or to rail control
just do everything he say 's and remember everything you see
let 's go
pelham 1 2 3 come in
who am i talking to ?
this is lieutenant UNknown
where 's my money
mr garber is a dependable man
he 's a good man too
is this the part where you try to get through to me ?
i don 't think so mother fucker !
i got 3 instructions for you
i want all the lights green and don 't trip me up with a red one you got that ?
over and out !
safety 's on safety 's off
what if they frisk me ?
we got that covered
you got that ?
just don 't fuck it up
we got an id on ryder
did a 9 year stretch the last 4 in the same cell block as phil ramos
he 's name shows up on an icelandic air passengers list in september of UNknown right after fashion week
dennis ford !
the kind of nonsense we would clean up if i ever get elected mayor yeah
he ran a private equity firm he 's biggest client was the city pension fund
maybe that 's why he 's so pissed off !
the judge gave him 10 years because we didn 't recover all of the city 's money
there was a couple of million UNknown for it was the siege money
siege money ?
you panic the market into a drop
if you know what 's coming you can make a great deal of money with 2 million dollars
what about the hostage money ?
are you kidding that 's nothing compared to the money you can make in the market
let 's get down town get to the UNknown
check the trades
turn around let him frisk you ?
i was worried about you
i thought maybe you UNknown l get lost then i remembered you were a UNknown so
these tunnels don 't change much do they ?
just the people in them
we good ?
let 's go !
your good looking too come on
what do you weigh about 220 ?
err yeah i 'm a 220 on a good day
ah that 's ramos
that 's why you brought me down here ?
well your a UNknown right ? once a UNknown always a UNknown
play your cards right you might get part of the cut
what the fuck ?
but i UNknown e got faith in you man
let me ask you one question
you know that saying when you told your wife about the UNknown how did she react ?
look we gotta talk about it ?
don 't be sensitive
did she freak out or what ?
she wasn 't happy but she understood
well that 's love right ?
no that 's marriage that 's another thing
so what 's the deal ? you think they 'r e going to move the train ?
seems like a possibility
i got a blanket on the UNknown !
i got radios cars manned on every exit from 42nd to south ferry
we got to go
i see red i don 't see green
what 's taking so fucking long ?
the blanket is not tucked in yet
you have to stall i need 2 minutes buy me two minutes
they haven 't cleared the tracks yet
mr ryder will be up and ready in less than two minutes
let 's roll let 's roll
you are bluffing
you got to say what you got to say
you thought by coming down here you 'd be UNknown didn 't you ?
god bless garber
the least the same fucked up
let 's go !
put some speed on it
you 'r e playing with fire my man
i want to see them green
change them to green or i UNknown l put a hole in garber 's head right now
do it !
what happens if they run a red light ?
it will trip the brakes
coming up on the first one
that 's what i 'm looking for
here he comes right now
your man garber is driving the train
the sniper confirmed
there is no fucking way
the sniper killed ramos he was their driver so they probably need garber to drive
when they get to coney island they gonna hit the trip and the brakes are gonna come on
was that a UNknown ?
about a tenth of a mile
stop when you get there we 'r e moving out ?
you got that
they have to they 'r e coming up to the signal point
what is that ?
you tell me
what the hell are they doing ?
why that little stop
some kind of an UNknown ?
yeah yeah some kind of an UNknown
that 's right
let 's go !
which way ?
i told you signal the points
how do you know they didn 't set the throttle and jump out ?
doesn 't matter doesn 't matter we UNknown e got every exit covered
there 's no where to go
listen the throttle can 't be set it has to be held
it 's a fail safe it 's a dead UNknown switch
if it doesn 't have a man 's hand pressing down on it the train stops cold
believe me they 'r e still on board
it 's going faster
let 's go !
that 's it !
the fucking train will pass cross over now !
we don 't have time
let 's go !
i fucking love you too !
believe me they 'r e still on board
yeah but they 'r e all green !
four stops away
there 's no UNknown on board
down the UNknown
the what ? a derelict tunnel built under the waldorf hotel converse everything on that area
i want a goddamn parade over it !
i 'm sorry
go go go !
how do you spell that ?
gar don 't worry about how to spell it just tell lieutenant UNknown that ryder is headed to the manhattan bridge
hey hey !
no no no
he started walking
when you put your socks on this morning huh ?
this make you feel better garber ?
that make everything okay now ?

alice we were just talking
i would prefer a little sister but a little brother is fine too

you haven 't said hello to tina
i will leave tonight
i think you are going to like one of them very much
but i know your parents
they are two very nice people who have experienced many good things together

i 'm so terribly ashamed !
you must choose now
no tonight ?
do you understand ?
here dad !
do you love mom ?
we are married mom and i
and we love our children
can 't we have a baby then ?
when he saw that neither the pillow or the quilt lied where they used to
who has been in my bed mama muff said who found her bed in disorder
in little UNknown 's bed UNknown slept
she heard the voices of the bears and dreamt that UNknown 's voice was the thunder
and mama muff 's voice made her dream about murmuring brooks
but suddenly she heard a high squeaky voice
go out and close the door
may i have a piece of cake ?
do you also want ?
i thought we could have a cosy evening
cosy evening ?
you said cosy evening ?
no i said she could have a piece of cake
i don 't need any
i thought you also wanted some
good night dear mom
answer me !
because you wanted to be close to her so that you could fuck her all summer !
how are the children going to find out ?
look dad UNknown on other women in front of the neighbours !
if you won 't tell i will !
we agreed to be careful with the children
have you been careful with them when you UNknown e been fucking that UNknown ?
shall you or me ?
if you forget something i will tell them
they will know exactly what kind of father they have !
the front door opens and slams
we can 't hear what they are UNknown
are you crazy ?
i can 't live here anymore
what the hell is she doing to my home ?
are you ok ?
it was such a horrible dream
go to bed now
if i tell you you can 't sleep either
yes a hundred million thousand times
what are you doing up this late ?
i just woke up
to me you may
don 't you understand what you could have done ?
it 's a pity i missed but there will be more chances
what are you talking about ?
alice come and lie next to me
let 's lie here together
won 't you undress ?
no it 's so cold here
come let 's warm up each other
are you sick ?
so go ahead !
i get some coffee so we can talk
i want to talk to them UNknown
i want to talk to you alice and
dad has met someone
as you have noticed
we become sad about this we can 't stand to have it like this
you become sad too
because we have tried to solve this
i think we should live in separate places
so you will take turns to be with us
it 's dad who wants to divorce
it 's he who wants to move out
but i want to be here to live here with you but it 's not working how things are now
tell them where you are going to live
i think it 's better if mom lives here with you
then i will live nearby so that you can be with me
and be with mom and then you can run between us
such a little UNknown !
tell them who you are going to live with
it 's perhaps not the right moment
what 's her name ?
when i was
then i met someone who
because mom and i can 't talk and comfort each other anymore
we can 't
and she also liked being with me
and we have met for a while now and you also know who it is
she has been here eating and i
she lives just here nearby
anna in the green house
who is mother to UNknown
dad will be a father to UNknown
stop damn it !
dad will get a new family
i don 't know but dad will probably soon find out what a damn bitch she is
school welfare offlcer
that 's what bothersome about it
she just cries every night
does you dad live with you now ?
no he has moved out
can 't you hear what i 'm saying ?
what the hell are you doing ?
grown ups shouldn 't teach children to swear
should children do whatever they like ?
you both have always been best friends
what happened ?
hanna lies about me in front of the others
no i don 't
alice 's dad has moved out
in UNknown with his new wife
ok that 's the way it is then because you should know
and alice where does your dad live ?
at home but right now he is travelling
ok that 's the way it is then because you should know
do you understand hanna ?
the bell rlngs
if you have problems you can talk to me
is there anything you want to tell me ?
what 's the time ?
i take the bike
i brought my brother 's new UNknown
i don 't know
you have your own key don 't you ?
newly cleaned !
can 't we visit the bathroom ?
UNknown hurry up !
let me out !
because we will re paint
why are all the clothes gone ?
he is wearing them when travelling
your dad doesn 't live here anymore
yes he does !
we must do it now
because we will leave in an hour
i must alice !
perhaps i can help you
alice listen !
let me help you a little
i must tell you some things
or well oh my dear child
he loves me and you very much
he misses you and your little brother so much it hurts
it serves him right
because it serves him right
he is full of shit
you don 't mean that
you don 't know what i mean
no that 's true
but i have seen you and your dad
it 's obvious how close you are together
not mom if you think so
i don 't think of anything about your mom
yes you do !
i have never heard him do that
then you apparently have a bad hearing
yes perhaps i have
so does mom
i have met your mom and she seems to me a very good mom
she will kill you if she sees you
no don 't worry
where have you been ?
do you have to run into the woods like that ?
i become so worried when you disappear
call your parents and ask if you may
the phone is there to the left
why don 't you ask me first ?
because you would have said no
i know what 's best for you
they have been very mean
you haven 't told the truth
dad should be ashamed not you
let 's do something fun now
muslc in UNknown volume
take the cucumber as well
the phone is rlnglng
i 'm helping her moving out
she called and told me you are sad
i 'm waving
i have to see you
mom says you have to call
i hear tell her i want to talk for a minute
he only wants to talk for a minute
i 'm cooking
just one question mom !
after the dinner
tell her that you are going to the toilet anything
it will go quickly
and i think of you dad
but couldn 't i have an old t shirt ?
what for ?
i have to go now
let 's sit here
if you want to talk about it then we can do it
or we could just sit here in silence and think
then i guess i should be heading back to the others
i lied to you
you do ?
i had so many questions but nobody to talk to
tell me how you feel
the school welfare offlce
no but dad seems more happy with that
she is completely alone
no never !
she won 't
but wouldn 't it be good if mom becomes happy that way ?
yes but she only becomes glad if dad comes to her
she loves dad so much she doesn 't know what to do
and dad will understand
i 'm sure
it 's only between me and her
i 'm not asking what you were talking about
i just wonder how you feel now
let 's ignore that repulsive school food
how about a hamburger ?
no mom we forgot the onion
no i can take
no wait !
but hey do you understand ?
haven 't you ?
why is she doing that ?
is she always like this ?
and then we hit a nail there
then there is titanic
we can do that one also
find a warmer jacket alice
please can you wait further away ?
a bit further away
it 's now you are needed as grandmother
that 's right !
you can 't just tramp in here as if the house was still yours

and you and UNknown as often as you like
we live with my mom
where is dad ?
i want to talk to you alone
haven 't you told that i will come here ?
where is UNknown ?
take it easy now
mom would be angry if i told her that anna will be here
i was afraid that she wouldn 't allow you to come here
and that 's why i didn 't say anything but i was just going to tell when anna came
but i understand
you only care about yourself
you give a damn about me !
i don 't know what to do
i just want everyone to be happy
i don 't want to be here
i want to go home to mom
but you just came here

i go out with the boots and the stuff to her
then you can dress UNknown and we will leave
damn it shouldn 't be like this
where are you ?

she is calling us bad words and dad just stands and watches

mom will not be glad if you come home sick
it would be fun if you join us
UNknown come !

do you want to see it ?
add to it a bit ?
you go ahead
now i will chase UNknown
no i don 't want to
don 't you want ?
no let go !
it 's embarrassing !
that was damn unnecessary
so many leaves
do you have to show everything ?
the children can 't handle this
i 'm showing that i love you
it 's too early
UNknown wait for me !
true love in the woods
let 's go !
from the sky i suppose
yes it seems so
let 's go on expedition
shall we go on expedition ?
you and me ?
well done dad !
higher dad higher !
he doesn 't understand
may i ?
UNknown and you
no there will be no food
yes we will eat in 15 minutes
you can taste my pancakes
mother 's are very delicious
don 't pay attention to her
i will make so delicious pancakes
what have you done with the UNknown ?
so let 's see
i will just do this
i use to turn them in the air but now it doesn 't work
this is how to show things
then it usually doesn 't work as well
damn pancake !
it 's that damn UNknown surface !
it becomes like this sometimes
now you UNknown l see
those damn fucking pancakes !
lie in your dad 's bed
that 's my mom 's
no it 's actually my dad 's
nothing here is his
just as much my mom 's !
hello there !
one at a time !
what 's the matter UNknown ?
i lied here first but must go
is this true alice ?
yes i actually want to rest a while and this is my dad 's bed
go out on the veranda then
if UNknown lies here then alice must respect that
they must both respect that this is our bedroom
shall alice be allowed to throw UNknown out ?
be sensible regarding the UNknown
we are five who feel different
i give a damn about this bed
me too !
yes damn it !
she thinks she decides over me
only my dad decides over me
but you don 't have any
are you stupid or what ?
he is a UNknown in canada
he cuts so big trees that you can 't find here
but we are actually 12 years old
do you want them to be together ?
everything to be as before
what do you want ?
i also want everything to be as before
are you deaf ?
incredibly delicious pancakes !
she becomes sorry
aren 't the pancakes to your taste ?
what 's wrong ?
alice are you doing this to your mother ?
no but she isn 't my mother
now damn it
what are you saying ?
i don 't get it
not me either
then you give up then the children win
do you mean that we must conquer them ?
our own children ?
i 'm just saying that we must give them more time
you said it yourself
but how much shit do i have to take from your daughter ?
only alice who is the problem ?
no UNknown also
i get no chance
you are a little sensitive now aren 't you ?
you are blind johan
not a single bad word about my son !
you spit out shit about my daughter
damn you !
go home to your wife
you are still married
without any problems at all !
go home to her !
run out to the woods then damn it !
as all the others !
are you sitting here by yourself ?
i cannot go on any longer
go on what ?
i 'm tired i want to rest
go ahead then
perhaps we should talk you and me
sleep well now
no i UNknown l sleep in there
i know that
i 'm just like that
if i become angry then i become angry
but lots of goodies also
if i become glad then i become glad also
i just want to say that i think you are such a nice girl
i will tell you a secret
something not even johan knows about yet
before i got UNknown i expected another child a girl
the first time i felt her kicking inside my stomach
then i knew immediately that this was a little alice
i don 't know why i just knew
her name will be alice
but when i was going to give birth then there was something wrong so she died
i still don 't know what was the cause
then i meet a wonderful man and she has a girl called alice !
isn 't it strange ?
but his father didn 't want to admit that UNknown is his son
he doesn 't even want to talk to him
UNknown dreams about him all the time
good night then alice
i 'm afraid i want to sleep with daddy
come i UNknown l go with you
is the ghost here ?
they are dreaming
alice told me
i get it !
it 's true
we came to collect the children
in an easy manner for the sake of the children
don 't take it personal
are you making fun of me ?
you must explain
and help UNknown
sonya we can 't just
henry tell them now
lotta was in despair when she heard alice 's cries for help
cries for help ?
you can hear what alice is saying
johan perhaps you should ask grandpa and grandma to walk in
hello my name is anna UNknown and i am johan 's wife
so far isn 't lotta johan 's wife ?
anna UNknown UNknown wife that is
welcome to the cottage
i like that in a man
in women as well
yes perhaps we can offer you a warming brandy ??
a small one
sorry dad sorry
i was just so sad and UNknown
you don 't have to UNknown
you feel what you feel
where UNknown lotta ?
do you really have to answer in that way ? !
by consideration if you recognize that word
sonya UNknown and you talk about consideration ?
you don 't know what consideration is damn it
they are waiting to tack us back
dad i want to talk to you
only a little thank you
you are my dad
yes because i said what i said in the phone and now mom has come here for me
but dad look what i 'm wearing
they are waiting for you now
what to say ?
yes nothing more to it but i want you to go too
shall really me and UNknown ?
i 'm not going to stand on the UNknown for myself
they are coming now
no you know mom
i call you tomorrow
how i have longed for you
how i have longed !
i have longed for you too !
anything particular you are angry with ?
that they are not listening
i love both mom and dad and want to be with both of them
but they always argue over the phone about where i should be and not be
what are you trying to say which they don 't listen to ?
i don 't want to feel myself as a letter which is thrown between two places
i want to feel secure wherever i am
lotta look !
how nice !
have you been driving in a cab ?
are you crazy ?
aren 't you freezing ?
i can smell the horses
come in !
not fancy but clean and warm
won 't we alice ?
i long for dad
when can they return back home then ?
this is their home
this is a mom
but the dads then ?
no they cannot see their dads again
no alice !
he is reporting in usa
tina wants to show you something
and we will check if the school is good here
the children are hungry and tired
alice can call you tonight
if you want something you can write a letter
why haven 't you told me ?
dad has been away
i haven 't talked to him
let me see your mobile phone !
but i can 't take all the calls
i don 't have the strength to talk to him
he has left us alice
he has a new family
we must build something new without him
how are we supposed to do it if he is interrupting us all the time ?
don 't you want me to meet dad ?
of course and UNknown too
but he has hurt us so much that we need to be alone for a while
when he calls like that he is only thinking of his own good thinking of himself
if he was thinking about you then he would leave you alone
he has bad conscience just because he left us
if he would think about your own good then he wouldn 't force you
to meet that woman and her son
you and me can cook something
i UNknown l just finish
i want us to talk now
let 's go then
he is lying in there alice will help you
tina and i will cook something first
we UNknown l fetch you when the food is ready
will you help UNknown ?
i UNknown l come back soon
i 'm not
i know that he has hurt you but your behaviour is not hurting johan
she is old enough for the truth
yes she is old enough but still a child
which truth by the way ?
she is your daughter not your friend
not you either in that case
lotta this is what i 'm trying to be
it 's not that damn easy for me !
you called and told me that you and johan had agreed
have you talked to johan ?
you are my friends both of you
besides i can 't stand watching how you force me to choose side
you already have
i can 't stand watching how you UNknown apart the relation that alice have to her father
you really take care of him
have you been together or something ?
damn it all !
perhaps you were fucking already back then
did you ?
don 't you talk to me about children
you stick to your damn horses !
listen to me !
i want to know where we are heading
if you don 't answer i will scream !
shut up now !
period nothing more to it
but that 's no answer
yes a very good answer !
if i say we are going then we are
but you don 't know where to go
yes i do
i don 't want to live in norway
i want to go home
no problem !
it went well
and anton ?
of course he does
come on !
what did he say ?
did he kiss you ?
when did you see UNknown recently ?
anna and UNknown quarrelled
do you know where he can be ?
when they lived in the green UNknown he was often in cabins in the wood
which wood ?
what did i say ?
UNknown forgive me
i know what you are thinking now but perhaps nothing has happened
he can be somewhere else
but now let the professionals take over
go UNknown back home all of you so that not your parents will be worried too
i will absolutely not
i UNknown l call as soon as we know more
i can accompany UNknown back home
yes that will be fine
forgive me UNknown forgive me
what happened yesterday evening ?
that 's something between UNknown and her
go home now
do you ?
now hurry up to mom and we will search
is mom at home ?
yes i may hello by the way
you have altered that
on the lawn yes
but will you now UNknown ?
have you ?
are you mad ?
but i think it 's best if you leave now
i will call dad
UNknown where have you been ?
when mom told that they were getting married
getting married ?
then she was sorry and then angry and told me that i 'm always nasty
then i said that i didn 't want to live with her and johan
do you know what she did then ?
then she said
then i left
i saw you when you searched today
how long will you be gone ?
a week until they miss me properly
but it 's so damn cold
i have done something wrong
i called mom a moment ago and said
that your mom had locked herself in a refuse container
why did you do that ?
i wanted mom to become worried but no afterwards i
can you say tell mom that i regret this a lot and apologize ?
i 'm no longer afraid of you !
just tell me where the container is !
what are you talking about ?
shut up !
UNknown was in my room just now but he went out in the woods again
he is very afraid of you all of you
oh my god alice
i will not go back to school until patrick is back
lotta of course she is worried
if he is allowed to run like that
your family is here alice
and dad and anna will get married
will they get married ?
come in now !
this is enough damn it !
how much more will he destroy things for us ?
in the nights in school at work !
damn i UNknown l be too late !
you can 't chase a child back home !
but what shall i do then ?
what do you think i should do damn it ?
what shall we do ?
but he can swim can 't he ?
he is twelve !
do you want him to die or what ?
run back home call dad and anna
show them the way
go and get them !
so it may be rather good for him even though he doesn 't feel that way
that my dad can join in as extra dad to him
because he has never had any dad
you agree well with UNknown
agree well but
we both want things as they were before
but we are not best friends

hong kong !!

you UNknown e already blown the UNknown chip twice trying to UNknown the rook and what 'a ve yer !

you are wise my trusted lieutenant
this is alpha calling dug
come in dug
i know i know !
have you seen the bird ?

her babies need her
because you sent her away there 's more for you
you said you had the bird

master will be most pleased we have found them and will ask of them many questions

i 'd be happy to oblige
well this is all a misunderstanding
my dogs made a mistake

it 's really him !
that 's charles UNknown !
it is ?
now you must be tired
they are our guests
the small mailman smells like chocolate
i 'm sorry about the dogs
hope they weren 't too rough on you
we weren 't
we 'r e not actually going inside the spirit of adventure itself ?
would i ?
he has lost the bird
put him in the cone of shame
i do not like the cone of shame
well most of the collection is UNknown in the world 's top museums
new york munich london
did you ever !
oh yes the UNknown
used my shaving kit to bring him down
oh my gosh !
oh you recognize it
he and i fell into a habit of playing gin rummy in the evenings and did he cheat !
oh he was horrible
there you go big fella
thank you master
well dinner is served
almost tempted to go back a few times but i have unfinished work here
oh UNknown you UNknown e done it again !
you know it 's because of you she had this dream to come down here and live by paradise falls
i 'm honored
you 'r e sure we 'r e not a bother ?
i 'd hate to impose
i want a treat !
having guests is a delight
more often i get thieves come to steal what 's rightfully mine
but once i bring back this creature my name will be cleared
beautiful isn 't it ?
i UNknown e spent a lifetime tracking it
sometimes years go by between UNknown
i UNknown e tried to smoke it out of that UNknown labyrinth where it lives
you can 't go in after it
once in there 's no way out
i UNknown e lost so many dogs
and here they come these bandits and think the bird is theirs to take
but they soon find that this mountain is a very dangerous place
hey that looks like kevin
i trained it to follow us
follow you ?
she goes UNknown for it
but it ran off
a surveyor making a map
a UNknown UNknown plants
i mean that 's the best one yet
i can 't wait to hear how it ends
well it 's been a wonderful evening but we better be going
oh you 'r e not leaving
we don 't want to take advantage of your hospitality
come on russell
the boy 's right
UNknown here makes a delicious cherries jubilee
oh you really must stay
master over here
stop you dogs
hang on to kevin !
can 't we help her get home ?
all right but we gotta hurry
you lost them ?
boy they are dumb
what a joke !
a squirrel walks up to a tree and says
i forgot to store acorns for winter and now i am dead
the wilderness isn 't quite what i expected
i mean it 's not how they made it sound in my book
get used to that kid
my dad made it sound so easy
he 's really good at camping and how to make fire from rocks and stuff
he used to come to all my sweat lodge meetings
and afterwards we 'd go get ice cream at UNknown
i always get chocolate and he gets butter UNknown
wait up you overgrown chicken
that 's it
run kevin !

according to the worker 's strike for the magistrate this is the first time in a few decades
that the moment the ship were freed of sight
everybody wants to know where they 'r e going to
there 's no way of knowing where they want us to join in return
we don 't know if they 'r e simply escaping whether he will affect the rescue plan
and as the so called UNknown says whether alien will declare war on us
this is the most known UNknown in this murder
and we can only speculate as what has happened to him
the UNknown UNknown there is state that he 's been captured by by alien or by another government
or by absolute UNknown government agency and is actually being held in captivity
yeah he was
and then that is the most difficult part is just not knowing where he is
because sadly he 's gone but i 'm the one who stays behind of all UNknown
i can 't give up
he died in my mind a long time ago
and that 's it
he was an honest man and he didn 't deserve any of what happened to him
i mean i know i look into the computer system and i found stuff
i mean the whole document is there
they didn 't even do a good job of hiding it
you guys haven 't seen it or what ?
let me show you what i have
my special angel

don 't you see ?
with the white UNknown and looks like an angel
you wanna see his daddy 's wife who 's an angel but this is a real ideal angel on the cameras

i found this at my front door

that 's mine
she dumped me !
you UNknown e never even had a girlfriend
shut up carter
maybe more like fantasy camp
come on you guys
what am i supposed to do now ?
it was all set
dude is that the kind of shit you would say to gina ?
you 'r e fucking lame
what 's up fellows ?
what 's up fletcher ?
what 's up with negative nancy over here ?
gina dumped him
i don 't think i 'm going anymore
that 's too bad
i almost didn 't make it back
almost didn 't make it back ?
dude it 's just college
yeah yeah just college
and then i went and i 'm telling you guys right now it is fucking nuts man
it 's UNknown
basically this is how it went down
i didn 't sleep for three days okay ?
i don 't have any money left in my bank account
i UNknown out my parents credit card which was only supposed to be used in case of an emergency
i lost my cell phone which is actually my dad 's cell phone
so he 's pissed about that and the credit card
i tried smoking a UNknown which i thought was a big fat joint
still got high
played naked frisbee did some whip its wet my brother 's bed twice
shit my pants once but please don 't tell anyone cause i 'm kind of embarrassed about that
saw two girls make out
with tongue !
found a tattoo on my lower back of a UNknown
don 't remember getting that
figure i UNknown l just tell people it 's some sort of killer UNknown
you know ?
come on man
you heard him
you know maybe i UNknown l even get a tattoo
wait you 'r e joking right ?
you got me UNknown
UNknown drinking sex
you know maybe gina 's right i 'm no fun
a weekend like fletcher 's is exactly what i need
UNknown having some crazy weekend to get back at gina is a really bad idea
or a really good idea and i say go for it
in fact i 'm gonna have a better weekend than fletcher
yeah man i UNknown e got a good feeling about this
good feeling ?
like your boy carter 's gonna get laid kind of feeling ?
cause i have that feeling too and i love it !
i don 't know man just everything
i 'm ready to have fun
yeah man good !
and there 's a UNknown UNknown reception tonight before dinner in the main
okay that 's enough !
that is enough
dude morris fuck UNknown man !

i UNknown l never open it !
you don 't have to carter
this is where the UNknown board put me and kevin

i 'm sure if we go there they UNknown l hook us up
yeah my parents would love that
we 'r e supposed to be staying in your room this weekend
so just come back later
probably just working out
pretty good ?
dude relax !
all right dude i 'm not perfect all right ?
all these greek letters look the same to me
maybe we should go back and try the dorm again
you shut your mouth !
shut your mouth !
come on real smooth carter
which she repeated back to me i 'd like to note
looking good goose
this fucking blows man !
what 's the point of college if you can 't have UNknown ?
you can 't graduate
it seems like torturing UNknown that 's all i 'm good at
that 's not true and you know that
you 'r e good at a lot of things
cooper tell him what he 's good at
it 's like a real gift
it is isn 't it ?
hang in there big guy
you 'r e all right
hang in there
hey man is this the beta phi house ?
my cousin is a legacy here
a pussy fart
who 'd want that name ?
yeah he earned it
come on man
we 'r e just up here to party you know ?
is that too much to ask ?
you guys are a bunch of high school kids ?
yeah yeah yeah
toby kicks ass
a couple of high school kids looking to crash here for the weekend
one of them was UNknown 's cousin
remember him ?
that thing he did with his tongue ?
so they 'r e looking for a place to crash huh ?
maybe we should let them stay
what are you serious ?
what the hell are we gonna do with a bunch of fucking high school kids here all weekend ?
i 'm kevin and this is morris and carter
well see technically we 'r e supposed to stay in the UNknown but our roommate 's a little
technically you 'r e a fag ! preoccupied
yeah he 's jerking off
how about i show you guys where you are staying ?
put your stuff away ?
morris do you like the sound of that ?
this is usually where we let our UNknown stay
we call this room the dungeon but don 't let the name scare you
you 'r e gonna love it
watch the step
dude it beats some guy jerking all right ?
like we said all of our guest rooms are taken tonight
is that a rat ?
a rat ?

in fact i think that the UNknown are having a UNknown tonight
are you talking ?
put that away
god i love the new attitude kevin
it looks good on you man
it makes your eyes pop and your hair shine
it makes your shirt look better
hey guys !
check it out !
morris i don 't think they 'r e drunk
who wants to play glow in the dark UNknown now ?
it 's UNknown tag !
it 's UNknown tag !
why would they send us to an all gay fraternity ?
do we look gay ?
maybe they found out how many times you UNknown e been laid and just assumed
real funny carter
i doubt they 'r e gonna do that to us on purpose
don 't worry !
just UNknown 's
did you guys find any dates ?
yeah real funny guys
watch your step UNknown UNknown !
this ain 't high school !
welcome to college boys
let 's rock this bitch
look we feel like absolute shit for what happened earlier
we weren 't trying to be like assholes or anything
let us make it up to you
we 'r e gonna go do some body shots
and we would love it if you guys would come with us
dude we are so down !
actually you know what ?
i just filled up so i 'm cool
yeah i think i 'm gonna take a pass too
lame and UNknown
dude where 's the bathroom ?
fuck it !
just in case
where did the girls go ?
unfortunately the girls had to go home early
so who are we doing body shots off of ?
great question mike
okay we 'r e outta here let 's go
yeah we thought you guys were cool
we thought you wanted to party
guess we were wrong
do it !
i 'm drunk right now
doing shots of tequila out of some guy 's ass crack will do that to you
is that a fat joke you bitch ?
when i miss
what do you say we wrap up this game and bring it up to my room ?
minus the UNknown
could i get the beer ?
who wants a balloon ?
UNknown bar !
whoa whoa whoa !
there you go darling that one 's just for you
i 'm gonna sit
have a balloon !
it makes chicks crazy horny like her
you want to go make out or something ?
oh my god !
do you mind ?
that 's cool
excuse me !
excuse me !
no no no
you UNknown l fit !
i will not fit under this bed
get under !
it 's fine
i UNknown e never really been with a girl before
don 't worry
go for what ?
your hands are like butter !
are like butter
plus i don 't have to worry about my mom walking in and
hey come on
they don 't call it a pocket rocket for nothing
you got it ?
are you sure ?
come on down and check it out
so i don 't really know what this means but amy says that she 's under the bed with your friend carter
should i be worried ?
that 's a good question
so what are you guys ?
i heard they have a really great program here
maybe you can give me a lesson sometime
wow motherfucker i can 't believe we did that shit last night
well you know i don 't even really feel like a college guy
maybe i UNknown l see you around
this is the greatest day of my life
you missed your interview morris
you blew it the scholarship UNknown everything
thank god !
i 'm sorry i 'm late
now behind me is the bronze statue of a revolutionary war hero
general w s UNknown
my life is over
dude they probably didn 't even notice
didn 't notice ?
yeah dude i did
and where the hell is kevin by the way ?
you know he should UNknown e been here by now
this is his campus tour
he probably just hooked up last night
at least someone did
dude it 's college
looking good UNknown
check it out
why would they do this to you ?
i don 't know
there 's some clothes in my car
we 'r e not going anywhere all right ?
i 'm not trying to prove anything
i 'm just trying to have fun
amen to that !
you call this having a good time ?
i UNknown l get back at them
it could have been worse
what could be worse than getting UNknown taped naked to a statue all night ?
you know what ?
we UNknown l post it online
yeah dude don 't push it
you know i mean it 's probably for the best
how 's it for the best ?
because if you went home now you know exactly what would happen
and now at least you could probably talk to that dean chandler guy
you know explain what happened
you really think that would work ?
i think it 's worth a shot
what do you have to lose ?
and you may see that heather chick again and get more than a half hand job
i think he UNknown l definitely see her again
looks like those high school UNknown aren 't as stupid as we thought
they got front row seats to UNknown city
UNknown throw parties and we have charity events
all right bitches you 'r e up !
this isn 't social hour !
so i guess you better go huh ?
yeah but maybe if you 'r e lucky we UNknown l let you guys buy us a few beers tonight at bruno 's
what 's that ?
just make sure you bring this guy
this guy ?
because of me ?
hey i was thinking maybe we could you know finish what we started last night
god that girl fucking rocks
hey kevin !
jesus christ !
hey i don 't suppose you know what happened to my car do you ?
so that 's how it 's gonna be UNknown ?
that 's right UNknown UNknown
in fact we got a job for you three UNknown bags
what kind of job ?
maybe wash my car
where did i put them keys ?
fuck that !
wait are you guys serious ?
well you guys didn 't think your room and board were gonna be free here did you ?
we 'r e not cleaning your house !
no fucking way !
how do you know we didn 't already tell them ?
because if you did they wouldn 't be giving you the time of day you little dicks
better get to work now boys !
pick the keys up
you don 't want my sloppy seconds do you ?
unless you 'r e into that ?
you fucking UNknown !
don 't they got UNknown to do this shit ?
dude i think this weekend we are the UNknown
because i UNknown e been working really hard and you want to ruin that for me
i love that !
yeah get some you punk ass bitch !
come here you steaming fuck !
i don 't know if this is a good idea
you want that scholarship don 't you ?
i believe in you !
you 'r e the UNknown bro !
yeah he 's totally fucked
heck i didn 't even know what some of those words meant
i had to search the internet for them
but i guess that 's what happens when you choose to stay at a UNknown house rather than the dorm room we assigned you
i know sir
christ if i had my way i 'd kick every fraternity off this campus
do you know that those animals suck UNknown UNknown out of balloons just to get high ?
mr hooper there is no doubt that you are UNknown gifted but the UNknown we give out here are about much more than just that
dean chandler that 's me
my family has a long history at UNknown and i 'd like to continue that legacy
well you know son i guess you 'r e gonna have to prove it to me
for as of right now mr hooper you and your scholarship are hanging by a thread
dude where have you been ?
it 's go time !
all my years of hard work have finally paid off !
that 's my boy
what 's wrong ?
or have you forgotten what that feels like ?
i understand man
somehow i have to convince the dean that i actually want to go here
well look there 's nothing you can do about it tonight all right ?
so let 's just go get our girls
let me see it
you guys are both just so ugly
you 'r e a little UNknown but it UNknown l be good
don 't worry about it
you know what ?
you like that when i squeeze them together for you ?
i said no

when we 'r e really in college ?
who knows ?
i know that
would you stop being a girl ?
would you please just shut up ?

thank you for your time detective and for the good police work
blanchard knew the white guy i guess
busted him once
take a look at top billing
you photo men finish taking your pictures now
coroner 's men put a sheet on the body as soon as they are done
we set up a perimeter six feet back
any reporter crosses it arrest him
now gentlemen before this gets out of hand
let 's put the UNknown on something
with publicity you get confessions
with confessions you get UNknown liars and false leads
so we keep some things quiet
the ear to ear facial UNknown UNknown you keep this information to yourselves
not your wives not your girlfriends no other officers and i mean no
UNknown what the hell are you doing here ?
where the hell 's blanchard ?
he 's right here
i heard something on the radio about a shooting
was that nash ?
we need to go check out that room
nash didn 't do this
that 's why he 's our priority UNknown
lee baxter fitch just happened to be there ?
what happened lee ?
i know you lee
dwight was it you or them ?
he saved my life
i know he 's an old beef of lee 's
but he doesn 't want to talk about it and he gets out in a week
you know who he is ?
i 'm scared dwight
you don 't know bobby
what do they feel when they cut their names into somebody else 's life ?
it was the case that made lee 's career
he 'd never said a word about it and i 'd never asked
one of lee 's UNknown fingered bobby dewitt a small time pimp with a yard iong rap as the brains behind the job
lee got kay or maybe it was the other way around
we 'r e supposed to be looking for nash
nice white girl gets UNknown
got to show the voters they did the right thing passing the bond issue
it 's a plus buck
we don 't miss this
maybe she wasn 't such a nice girl
maybe that old lady that nash UNknown was somebody 's loving granny
maybe we let the bureau handle this and we get back to our job before nash UNknown somebody else
got any other UNknown ?
yeah maybe we UNknown e had enough headlines
with or without you buck
with or without you
i can guarantee you this killer will be caught
slow and easy buck
you did what ?
it 's all right
nash is pure UNknown
what 's your problem with this ?
letting nash slip
the cadaver is presented in two halves with UNknown level with the UNknown
through and through UNknown of both mouth corners
no visible UNknown on the neck
UNknown UNknown on the wing tips of the UNknown bones
and oh !
on the palm of the right hand
UNknown stomach spleen liver all removed
is it all right to smoke doctor ?
she won 't mind
both legs broken at the knee
well here 's what she wasn 't she wasn 't raped and she wasn 't pregnant
in terms of the UNknown UNknown the cause of death is either the mouth wound here or she was beaten to death with something like a baseball bat
what about her insides ?
they came out UNknown
have you got a name yet ?
elizabeth ann short
four sisters parents divorced her father 's here in l a
oh and i hear he sold some old photos of her to the herald
i got an alibi just in case you think i did it
tighter than a crab 's ass and that is airtight
detective UNknown mr short
yeah i know who you are
neither of you 'd have lasted a round against jim jeffries
and as for betty she called the tune she paid the piper
you want to hear my alibi ?
yeah since you 'r e so anxious to tell it
johnny on the spot here at the diner
twenty seven straight hours at that grill

some soldier beat her up pretty bad
that 's the last i heard from her

ellis UNknown 's looking to make a career on it
i think lee 's not far behind
what about you ?
the three of us i don 't know
he 's my partner
he 's done even more for me
there 's food in the fridge

was anybody threatening her ?
it was too many friends
i gathered that
how about the movies ?

darling i 'm in
guess after all those screen tests she finally got a part
but she had a tendency to
stretch the truth ?
what is it ?
and she she was wearing a man 's suit and had a man 's short haircut
but it was just that once
miss UNknown are you saying they were talking to a UNknown ?
UNknown UNknown honklng
well then how about you arrest me ?
because the truck don 't wait !
why don 't we take a look inside lorna 's bag and then maybe you can go
they weren 't exactly studios
because i 'm a whiz with UNknown and i basically do every accent in the world
we don 't really need an accent thank you
cause i can be from anywhere
i would have to meet with my dialect coach milton UNknown who was introduced to me by david UNknown
you know david o

and he 's treated me like a lady and with respect and guess what
he was very very very impressed when i did my scarlett for him
no i didn 't audition for gone with the wind but the thing is
gosh i just love that movie so much that i decided that i had to memorize all of scarlett 's UNknown

but i think you 'r e handsome and i 'm going to do it for you right now
as god is my witness

i was worried it was true
slumming miss UNknown ?
UNknown girl you shouldn 't be UNknown
in such UNknown places
i know you knew them so don 't jerk me off

imagine the headlines
UNknown at UNknown nightclub
lorna talked about her stupid boyfriend back in UNknown nebraska or wherever
betty talked about the latest issue of screen world
UNknown hollywood dreams the whole sad nine yards
so did betty ever tell you about a movie she was in ?
on a UNknown level they were right up there with you
if you want UNknown call daddy but please be discreet
so what do i have to do to keep my name out of the papers ?
what do you mean ?
that 's not very convincing
i don 't need your daddy 's money if that 's what you 'r e saying
you know it 's not what i 'm saying
i might be convinced
i know the address
oh one more thing
i UNknown e just learned to type
yes i understand
what if the werewolf is UNknown sheridan ?
yes that would be more efficient
i love tip duty
i was thinking maybe i should talk to him
yeah it 's an earthquake
i heard it
daddy 's heard of you and he insists you stay for dinner
i told him we met at that art exhibit at stanley UNknown 's book shop
so if you have to pump everybody for my alibi be subtle
UNknown was bringing in the paper when daddy found out he made his first million

haute UNknown breeds UNknown
you 'r e in for a cruel UNknown bucky
UNknown 's my pretty one but martha 's my certified genius
what kind of a name is UNknown ?
hitler was a bit excessive
but mark my words that someday we UNknown l regret not joining forces with him to fight the UNknown
you know i killed a lot of your countrymen during the war
mr UNknown have you met UNknown in the hallway ?
we were in the scots UNknown together
when did you move here ?
georgie got work as a lighting man me building houses
georgie introduced me to mack UNknown
i helped him build that housing project he was putting up underneath that god awful sign
he had extras UNknown as laborers and vice versa
georgie and i used to drive them over to UNknown after 12 hours on a silent UNknown
then put in another six hours by UNknown
he even gave us movie credits a couple of times
would you like to contribute to the conversation ?
did you know mr UNknown that UNknown boulevard is named after me ?
i didn 't
are you familiar with the neighborhood mr UNknown ?
i grew up there
i hear many of them know mr
UNknown by name
he 's a common policeman

that 's how he really made his money
he 's got UNknown all over l a
his good friend georgie UNknown in a car crash while running daddy some errands
and now he throws him scraps odd jobs tending daddy 's rental properties
you don 't have to tell me this

last summer i heard about a girl who looked like me
i got curious
your look alike wants to meet you things like that
i left my number

i UNknown e worked hard to be loose
but the way people described betty it was like she was a natural

i try to be
and remember go back to the beginning you 'r e begging him
you 'r e begging him

i 'm an UNknown minor and if you touch me without a matron present i UNknown l sue you !
did you ever get any movie work ?
it 's a movie
something tells me it 's not david o UNknown
now you have to tell us the whole thing sweetheart so think it through
i was UNknown at a bar in UNknown
this man started talking to me
i thought i was pregnant and i was desperate wicked bad for money
he said he 'd give me 200 to act in a UNknown film
he said he needed another girl so i called betty
then he drove us back to l a
where was this house exactly ?
i was pretty out of it if you know what i mean
this got anything to do with the girl 's murder ?
long shot chief
your boy can 't hold his water ?
i got you warrants
you 'r e a punch drunk washed up fighter
stay out of this UNknown !
you 'r e back on warrants as of tomorrow
i want you to report to me at UNknown with a letter of apology for chief green
you are a political animal and for the sake of your pension
i suggest that you grovel
it is now 8 15 in the morning
where 's your partner ?
i don 't know
well it is 8 15 and he is not here and neither are his letters of apology
UNknown get out of my sight
try and be a police officer
offlcer on radlo
here he is dead in the middle of a stickup
he was trash and a killer and i 'd been right from the beginning
we let him slip and the innocent died
for messing up nash
winning the UNknown got me a sprained wrist two UNknown knuckles and the rest of the day off
smile at me
she had a copy of a stag film her and betty short playing les
pretty spooky stuff
no mention of that number leaving note thing that you did
it 's a fair trade but it shakes me
are you sure there isn 't anything you haven 't told me about you and betty ?
betty and i made love once that one time last summer
i just did it to see what it would be like to do it with someone who looked like me
lee always said i 'd be safe
you will be
she was killed when lee was 15 and they never caught the guy
he made me promise never to tell you
he thought it made him too easy to figure
well it sure explains some things
no it doesn 't
if you know you should tell me
kay bobby dewitt just got out
lee 's all hopped up on UNknown so what do you think is going to happen ?
where is he ?
the guy from new year 's ?
bobby 's got a drug deal somewhere in a building friedman owns the olympic i think
keep your hands where i can see them
you 'r e here for a drug deal with UNknown friedman
i know that
lee blanchard 's here
yeah but he 's been on your mind
and you UNknown e been on his mind
i 'm thinking that you let the word out there knowing he 'd come down here
look maybe i UNknown my trap at trial
maybe i was thinking revenge maybe talking trash to my UNknown but all i know is what i read in the papers and when that fucker killed them niggers
what 's your version ?
sir all this between me and blanchard is that i fucked this big UNknown dakota cunt named kay lake
the guy with the choke rope
i assume dewitt brought him for muscle
no identification nothing left of his face after he hit the fountain
you understand why we must handle things like this huh ?
it 's your building
i can 't think of another way can you ?
fire and ice
lee had turned his life inside out and my dad 's apartment into the black dahlia 's house of horrors
i confessed to the only priest i needed
how long have you known about this ?
i don 't know
i don 't know
stupid son of a bitch getting himself killed over a little UNknown like bobby dewitt
well that 's as far as it goes then
mo friedman was right
neither does kay
we are going to make something of this
what 's the matter with you ?
just a bad day
you look like you have a hell of a lot of fun
oh i sure do
you got any special guys that you you know
i have a UNknown
and it was one of those things that was
gosh i don 't know if you UNknown e experienced this before but it was love at first sight
yeah i get it about five times a night
he asked me to marry him that night
and then the next day he was just gone
well that ask you to marry him always works
no he promised he 'd come back
he was an air force captain which is why he had to leave
he went overseas
he used to write me such beautiful UNknown romantic love letters
oh a poet
well the night that he was supposed to come back he was called to do one last mission and his plane crashed over india
and now he 's dead
boy you sure know how to tell a funny story
yeah i sure do
anything new you need him to add ?
wednesday nights were the nights she 'd make lee and me a big dinner so
we haven 't done it since
we 'r e going to try
should we say something ?
we haven 't said anything
to my UNknown
haven 't done anything right
there 's nothing to say
i could UNknown e saved him
UNknown home construction ?
you got it in you to replace a few ?
yeah of course
were you ever going to tell me ?
he 'd given all his money to ben UNknown and he
he wanted to buy us a home
i didn 't know there was any left
were you ever going to tell me ?
something 's burning
don 't get the wrong idea
i don 't know what kind of idea i got right now
things were getting really bad between me and bobby and i had to get out
i knew this guy that bobby made me be with once
he was a UNknown who let it slip that he sometimes UNknown to the cops for dope money
and that 's how you met lee ?
the UNknown ?
he found out that bobby was getting out and he threatened to tell him that we stole from him
he wanted money that we didn 't have dwight
he wanted 10 000
promise me promise me you UNknown l forgive him for dewitt
forgive him for the bank
what was the guy 's name ?
it doesn 't matter
it was baxter fitch
lee killed them both and took the bank money making me witness stooge weak point in a fairy tale triangle
dwight he loved you
this had nothing to do with us dwight !
nothing stays buried forever
i didn 't believe in fairy tales
it was a reunion of UNknown tramps old UNknown who knew they 'd never have it as good with anybody else
we were in the scots regiment together
the way your father described him
that 's very nice of him
i doubt modern art gets you either
but i do
what am i doing here ?
how could you ?
what have i done ?
i lied for you !
i lied for us !
what could i do but lie dwight ?
you could have told me the truth
she looks like that dead girl !
how sick are you ?
you 'r e going to end up like lee
how sick are you ?
you 'r e going to end up like lee
for that i needed to stop worrying about who killed the dahlia and focus on where
i helped him build that housing project he was putting up underneath that god awful sign
there UNknown l be hell to pay
it 's about time i showed the three of you good old scotland
i don 't want to go to europe daddy
you 'r e always talking about how dreadful and provincial it is
yeah but it 's got what you need lassie
what is that emmett ?
UNknown like me ?
you made that stag film with lorna and betty
i UNknown e seen the set
i found it all
you 'r e not the shooting type and i 'm not the dying type
jesus christ UNknown
i UNknown e seen the movie
i UNknown e got you
so you don 't like my taste in art
i don 't think that 's a crime
he saw them make the movie and he got crazy about betty
i put daddy on and he offered her money to date a nice man he knew
you must UNknown e known he was a sick fuck then
well he was UNknown
i mean his father was a surgeon
did you know that ?
famous in scotland
now you let him go !
i would appreciate it if you just stopped shooting things officer though
the rich don 't own art just for themselves
we safe keep it for future generations
how did emmett damage georgie ?
what did he do to make him go so crazy ?
who made what made who crazy ?
it was madeleine
but he was her father
and for that he ruined george 's face
when he got out of hospital
i gave him the hugo book as a present
he had worked construction on that movie with emmett
it was always one of his favorites
that 's right
well that was the UNknown joke of all
he was obsessed with her you know that filthy film !
he 's a shy wee lad but i
it 'd make him very happy i think if you 'd take him out on a wee date
she looked so like my UNknown
it was the UNknown joke of all
you know that
the rich lived differently
hello officer UNknown
i came to talk to you about lee blanchard
he came here didn 't he ?
asking about your sister and the dahlia ?
i UNknown e got business with the lady
he knew everything didn 't he ?
i don 't know what you 'r e saying
i went by your house today
i talked to your sister martha
she told me that a policeman named lee blanchard came by the house asking questions about you and elizabeth short
she told him that the two of you were close
martha was always jealous of me
he was blackmailing your father
for messing up nash
like a dog
i haven 't had a chance to shoot anybody yet
what do you think ?
i think you 'd rather fuck me than kill me but you don 't have the guts to do either
you 'r e a boxer not a fighter
you 'r e a murderer
of my partner
if it weren 't for me you wouldn 't have had the balls to fuck your partner 's girl
you don 't talk about them okay ?
because you 'd rather fuck me
you don 't talk about them
you chose me over her
you UNknown l choose me over him
he was going to take daddy 's money and leave
leave all of you
don 't forget who i look like
because that girl that sad dead bitch she 's all you have
people i 'd betrayed and people i needed to protect

a toast to proposition b
to the UNknown blanchard UNknown bigger than louis UNknown
to my UNknown !
lee and i captured 11 hard UNknown 18 traffic UNknown and three parole and probation UNknown
sometimes she 'd make dinner for us
other times the three of us would go out on the town
always she 'd be there never between us always in the middle
texas state prison
she died last night
of course i didn 't care if he was a hard man or what he thought about anything

he saved my life
i ain 't done nothing !
yeah what do you call that shooting gallery back there ?
fuck you man !
thank you for your time detective and for the good police work
blanchard knew the white guy i guess
busted him once
take a look at top billing
you photo men finish taking your pictures now
coroner 's men put a sheet on the body as soon as they are done
we set up a perimeter six feet back
any reporter crosses it arrest him
now gentlemen before this gets out of hand
let 's put the UNknown on something
with publicity you get confessions
with confessions you get UNknown liars and false leads
so we keep some things quiet
the ear to ear facial UNknown UNknown you keep this information to yourselves
not your wives not your girlfriends no other officers and i mean no
UNknown what the hell are you doing here ?
where the hell 's blanchard ?
he 's right here
i heard something on the radio about a shooting

lee baxter fitch just happened to be there ?
what happened lee ?

but he doesn 't want to talk about it and he gets out in a week
you know who he is ?
i 'm scared dwight
you don 't know bobby
what do they feel when they cut their names into somebody else 's life ?
it was the case that made lee 's career
he 'd never said a word about it and i 'd never asked
one of lee 's UNknown fingered bobby dewitt a small time pimp with a yard iong rap as the brains behind the job
lee got kay or maybe it was the other way around
we 'r e supposed to be looking for nash
nice white girl gets UNknown
got to show the voters they did the right thing passing the bond issue
it 's a plus buck
we don 't miss this
maybe she wasn 't such a nice girl
maybe that old lady that nash UNknown was somebody 's loving granny
maybe we let the bureau handle this and we get back to our job before nash UNknown somebody else
got any other UNknown ?
yeah maybe we UNknown e had enough headlines
with or without you buck
with or without you
i can guarantee you this killer will be caught
slow and easy buck
you did what ?
it 's all right
nash is pure UNknown
what 's your problem with this ?
letting nash slip
the cadaver is presented in two halves with UNknown level with the UNknown
through and through UNknown of both mouth corners
no visible UNknown on the neck
UNknown UNknown on the wing tips of the UNknown bones
and oh !
on the palm of the right hand
UNknown stomach spleen liver all removed
is it all right to smoke doctor ?
she won 't mind
both legs broken at the knee
well here 's what she wasn 't she wasn 't raped and she wasn 't pregnant
in terms of the UNknown UNknown the cause of death is either the mouth wound here or she was beaten to death with something like a baseball bat
what about her insides ?
they came out UNknown

elizabeth ann short
four sisters parents divorced her father 's here in l a
oh and i hear he sold some old photos of her to the herald

neither of you 'd have lasted a round against jim jeffries
and as for betty she called the tune she paid the piper
you want to hear my alibi ?
yeah since you 'r e so anxious to tell it

but it was just that once
miss UNknown are you saying they were talking to a UNknown ?
UNknown UNknown honklng

cause i can be from anywhere
i would have to meet with my dialect coach milton UNknown who was introduced to me by david UNknown

and he 's treated me like a lady and with respect and guess what
he was very very very impressed when i did my scarlett for him

on a UNknown level they were right up there with you
if you want UNknown call daddy but please be discreet
so what do i have to do to keep my name out of the papers ?
what do you mean ?
that 's not very convincing
i don 't need your daddy 's money if that 's what you 'r e saying
you know it 's not what i 'm saying
i might be convinced
i know the address
oh one more thing
i UNknown e just learned to type

yes that would be more efficient
i love tip duty
i was thinking maybe i should talk to him
yeah it 's an earthquake
i heard it
daddy 's heard of you and he insists you stay for dinner
i told him we met at that art exhibit at stanley UNknown 's book shop
so if you have to pump everybody for my alibi be subtle

haute UNknown breeds UNknown

UNknown 's my pretty one but martha 's my certified genius
what kind of a name is UNknown ?
hitler was a bit excessive
but mark my words that someday we UNknown l regret not joining forces with him to fight the UNknown
you know i killed a lot of your countrymen during the war
mr UNknown have you met UNknown in the hallway ?
we were in the scots UNknown together
when did you move here ?
georgie got work as a lighting man me building houses
georgie introduced me to mack UNknown
i helped him build that housing project he was putting up underneath that god awful sign

georgie and i used to drive them over to UNknown after 12 hours on a silent UNknown
then put in another six hours by UNknown
he even gave us movie credits a couple of times
would you like to contribute to the conversation ?
did you know mr UNknown that UNknown boulevard is named after me ?

i grew up there
i hear many of them know mr

i got curious
your look alike wants to meet you things like that

it 's a movie
something tells me it 's not david o UNknown
now you have to tell us the whole thing sweetheart so think it through
i was UNknown at a bar in UNknown
this man started talking to me
i thought i was pregnant and i was desperate wicked bad for money
he said he 'd give me 200 to act in a UNknown film
he said he needed another girl so i called betty
then he drove us back to l a
where was this house exactly ?
i was pretty out of it if you know what i mean
this got anything to do with the girl 's murder ?
long shot chief

i got you warrants
you 'r e a punch drunk washed up fighter
stay out of this UNknown !

i want you to report to me at UNknown with a letter of apology for chief green
you are a political animal and for the sake of your pension
i suggest that you grovel
it is now 8 15 in the morning

i don 't know
well it is 8 15 and he is not here and neither are his letters of apology
UNknown get out of my sight
try and be a police officer
offlcer on radlo
here he is dead in the middle of a stickup
he was trash and a killer and i 'd been right from the beginning
we let him slip and the innocent died
for messing up nash
winning the UNknown got me a sprained wrist two UNknown knuckles and the rest of the day off
smile at me
she had a copy of a stag film her and betty short playing les
pretty spooky stuff
no mention of that number leaving note thing that you did
it 's a fair trade but it shakes me
are you sure there isn 't anything you haven 't told me about you and betty ?
betty and i made love once that one time last summer
i just did it to see what it would be like to do it with someone who looked like me
lee always said i 'd be safe
you will be
she was killed when lee was 15 and they never caught the guy
he made me promise never to tell you
he thought it made him too easy to figure
well it sure explains some things
no it doesn 't
if you know you should tell me
kay bobby dewitt just got out
lee 's all hopped up on UNknown so what do you think is going to happen ?
where is he ?
the guy from new year 's ?
bobby 's got a drug deal somewhere in a building friedman owns the olympic i think
keep your hands where i can see them
you 'r e here for a drug deal with UNknown friedman
i know that
lee blanchard 's here
yeah but he 's been on your mind
and you UNknown e been on his mind
i 'm thinking that you let the word out there knowing he 'd come down here
look maybe i UNknown my trap at trial
maybe i was thinking revenge maybe talking trash to my UNknown but all i know is what i read in the papers and when that fucker killed them niggers
what 's your version ?
sir all this between me and blanchard is that i fucked this big UNknown dakota cunt named kay lake
the guy with the choke rope
i assume dewitt brought him for muscle
no identification nothing left of his face after he hit the fountain
you understand why we must handle things like this huh ?
it 's your building
i can 't think of another way can you ?
fire and ice
lee had turned his life inside out and my dad 's apartment into the black dahlia 's house of horrors
i confessed to the only priest i needed
how long have you known about this ?
i don 't know
i don 't know
stupid son of a bitch getting himself killed over a little UNknown like bobby dewitt
well that 's as far as it goes then
mo friedman was right
neither does kay
we are going to make something of this
what 's the matter with you ?
just a bad day
you look like you have a hell of a lot of fun
oh i sure do
you got any special guys that you you know
i have a UNknown
and it was one of those things that was
gosh i don 't know if you UNknown e experienced this before but it was love at first sight
yeah i get it about five times a night
he asked me to marry him that night
and then the next day he was just gone
well that ask you to marry him always works
no he promised he 'd come back
he was an air force captain which is why he had to leave
he went overseas
he used to write me such beautiful UNknown romantic love letters
oh a poet
well the night that he was supposed to come back he was called to do one last mission and his plane crashed over india
and now he 's dead
boy you sure know how to tell a funny story
yeah i sure do
anything new you need him to add ?
wednesday nights were the nights she 'd make lee and me a big dinner so
we haven 't done it since
we 'r e going to try
should we say something ?
we haven 't said anything
to my UNknown
haven 't done anything right
there 's nothing to say
i could UNknown e saved him
UNknown home construction ?
you got it in you to replace a few ?
yeah of course
were you ever going to tell me ?
he 'd given all his money to ben UNknown and he
he wanted to buy us a home
i didn 't know there was any left
were you ever going to tell me ?
something 's burning
don 't get the wrong idea
i don 't know what kind of idea i got right now
things were getting really bad between me and bobby and i had to get out
i knew this guy that bobby made me be with once
he was a UNknown who let it slip that he sometimes UNknown to the cops for dope money
and that 's how you met lee ?
the UNknown ?
he found out that bobby was getting out and he threatened to tell him that we stole from him
he wanted money that we didn 't have dwight
he wanted 10 000
promise me promise me you UNknown l forgive him for dewitt
forgive him for the bank
what was the guy 's name ?
it doesn 't matter
it was baxter fitch
lee killed them both and took the bank money making me witness stooge weak point in a fairy tale triangle
dwight he loved you
this had nothing to do with us dwight !
nothing stays buried forever
i didn 't believe in fairy tales
it was a reunion of UNknown tramps old UNknown who knew they 'd never have it as good with anybody else
we were in the scots regiment together
the way your father described him
that 's very nice of him
i doubt modern art gets you either
but i do
what am i doing here ?
how could you ?
what have i done ?
i lied for you !
i lied for us !
what could i do but lie dwight ?
you could have told me the truth
she looks like that dead girl !
how sick are you ?
you 'r e going to end up like lee
how sick are you ?
you 'r e going to end up like lee
for that i needed to stop worrying about who killed the dahlia and focus on where
i helped him build that housing project he was putting up underneath that god awful sign
there UNknown l be hell to pay
it 's about time i showed the three of you good old scotland
i don 't want to go to europe daddy
you 'r e always talking about how dreadful and provincial it is
yeah but it 's got what you need lassie
what is that emmett ?
UNknown like me ?
you made that stag film with lorna and betty
i UNknown e seen the set
i found it all
you 'r e not the shooting type and i 'm not the dying type
jesus christ UNknown
i UNknown e seen the movie
i UNknown e got you
so you don 't like my taste in art
i don 't think that 's a crime
he saw them make the movie and he got crazy about betty
i put daddy on and he offered her money to date a nice man he knew
you must UNknown e known he was a sick fuck then
well he was UNknown
i mean his father was a surgeon
did you know that ?
famous in scotland
now you let him go !
i would appreciate it if you just stopped shooting things officer though
the rich don 't own art just for themselves
we safe keep it for future generations
how did emmett damage georgie ?
what did he do to make him go so crazy ?
who made what made who crazy ?
it was madeleine
but he was her father
and for that he ruined george 's face
when he got out of hospital
i gave him the hugo book as a present
he had worked construction on that movie with emmett
it was always one of his favorites
that 's right
well that was the UNknown joke of all
he was obsessed with her you know that filthy film !
he 's a shy wee lad but i
it 'd make him very happy i think if you 'd take him out on a wee date
she looked so like my UNknown
it was the UNknown joke of all
you know that
the rich lived differently
hello officer UNknown
i came to talk to you about lee blanchard
he came here didn 't he ?
asking about your sister and the dahlia ?
i UNknown e got business with the lady
he knew everything didn 't he ?
i don 't know what you 'r e saying
i went by your house today
i talked to your sister martha
she told me that a policeman named lee blanchard came by the house asking questions about you and elizabeth short
she told him that the two of you were close
martha was always jealous of me
he was blackmailing your father
for messing up nash
like a dog
i haven 't had a chance to shoot anybody yet
what do you think ?
i think you 'd rather fuck me than kill me but you don 't have the guts to do either
you 'r e a boxer not a fighter
you 'r e a murderer
of my partner
if it weren 't for me you wouldn 't have had the balls to fuck your partner 's girl
you don 't talk about them okay ?
because you 'd rather fuck me
you don 't talk about them
you chose me over her
you UNknown l choose me over him
he was going to take daddy 's money and leave
leave all of you
don 't forget who i look like
because that girl that sad dead bitch she 's all you have
people i 'd betrayed and people i needed to protect
and for the first time in my life
i had people that knew that for the UNknown of times in the darkest of places
i had been so so good at some things
everyone should just die
we finally meet
be careful with it
that 's none of your concern
this evening there was a divine message from god
everything will be over in an instant
there aren 't any survivors here
she 's alive !
a police unit set up to counter UNknown
starting with UNknown we UNknown l request an official announcement of level 1 on all international UNknown
you still can 't get a listing of the russian terror group ?
it has a working team under the defense ministry
hurry up !
no courtesy at all
it seems like the whole area has been sealed off by the military
the town has disappeared
the citizens died in an instant
i didn 't think i 'd meet a beautiful woman like you in tokyo
i want to know more about you
just because you want to know more
i hate hasty guys
what are you planning to do in tokyo ?
soon tokyo will disappear
soon tokyo will disappear
inside his body this chip was found
according to the message left in it it is uncertain what happened in UNknown
there is a possibility of a terror attack
we think the next target is tokyo and that they will strike within a few days
leaving that aside we must find out what exactly happened in russia
is there any news from UNknown san in russia ?
there isn 't
that guy might be able to do it
the genius UNknown from that incident
do you mean falcon ?
falcon ? !
the last blood national holiday is coming soon
what are you doing let go !
god punishment dealt in an instant
the last key
it 's been a long time UNknown UNknown
three years since then ?
until two years ago you were a legendary UNknown
your internet alias was falcon
when we discovered that you were only a junior high student we were really surprised
moreover that you are UNknown 's son
soon they UNknown l try to do the same with tokyo
i want you to find out what happened
in this town there 's a major russian military installation
we want you to hack into their computer
i thought you could do it
you mean you want me to commit a crime ?
if you think that way you already committed a crime two years ago
since your ability could save people why don 't you use it ?
what can that brat do ?
this isn 't child 's play
right UNknown san ?
everyone will vanish
soon he will bring judgment upon this world
soon he will bring judgment upon this world
everything will be over in an instant

ah you 'r e really angry
do you think this is the time to play games ?
ouch ouch ouch !
isn 't it you ?
at this rate even from my point of view i can 't avoid UNknown you from school
what would be best ?
is it all right ?
because she doesn 't want to trouble them with tuition or living expenses she has to work part time
two weeks ?
do you mean to write about it in this month 's student newspaper ?
i think school 's attention to rules should be changed too
but on the other hand won 't fussing about it and creating an uproar hurt UNknown ?
and if we screw up we might be in the focus of the school superiors
now 's not the time to be saying those things is it ?
it hurts !
hey UNknown !
was it okay ?
oh you 'r e overdoing it
it 's been a long time since we all ate together
that 's why this food
you shouldn 't expect too much
has that guy ever kept a promise ?
don 't call dad 't hat guy
people who come up with those ideas are great aren 't they ?
it would sell really well
what a shame
please eat dinner with UNknown
i 'm sorry
shut up !
as proof i attached a picture
you will do anything huh ?
please come to the staff room right away
i see an idiot
hurry get to your classroom !
sensei could it be you don 't know about it yet ?
look at that idiot !
biology teacher UNknown sensei is retiring
though his replacement has yet to be confirmed all student do not worry and please continue to work hard towards a higher goal
reduction of discipline
maybe god exists after all
that can 't be
someone probably sent an UNknown virus to UNknown UNknown 's computer
then that person found an embarrassing picture of UNknown and flooded the net with it
who could it be ?
i think he 's definitely somewhere in this school
hm do you think so ?
but this will become an article for sure won 't it ?
UNknown UNknown do you know anything ?
let 's go
i UNknown l remember that later
i told you we don 't have anything to do with each other

you hacked into a school computer last night didn 't you ?
that 's a crime !
it hurts it hurts i said it hurts !
then you UNknown l UNknown come with us won 't you ?
that 's blackmail isn 't it ?
this UNknown is being provided only for the special third division
it 's a present for you
what if i don 't want it ?
then we will arrest you
that 's dirty !
that 's our job
spies and terrorists are crawling around
if we use proper means we can 't protect this country
with your ability the country could be saved
why don 't you use it ?
can you let me talk to my dad ?
i 'm sorry UNknown
this is the first time somebody said they would arrest me if i wouldn 't commit a crime
i will refuse the matter in your place
as a father ?
i wouldn 't have known about you at all
if something happens i might not be able to protect you until the end
i know that
you 'r e right
enough of your excuses !
i have one condition
UNknown always makes dinner and waits for you at home !
i 'm okay but please do something more father like for UNknown !

a part of russia 's UNknown is secretly selling japan 's enterprise at the future 's market
it means that japan 's shares will UNknown before long

there 's the UNknown
it 's a bother if you guys who are trying to rescue the country cause such a riot
what did you say asshole ? !
try saying that again !
stop it UNknown
he probably received training from an army somewhere
what are you doing ?
what is this ?
we can 't let you do that
he must have been following either me or chief UNknown
but you would have recognized that right away
you both are not amateurs
didn 't you guide the murderer here to kill chief UNknown ?
what ? !
UNknown san it was you
that 's stupid !
this thing is slow
please apologize to UNknown for me
you promised her didn 't you ?
i involved you in something unexpected
stop the UNknown right now
if you don 't you UNknown l become their target too
also please protect UNknown
we won 't see each other anymore but please believe me on this
i will always be on your and UNknown 's side
no matter what others say
what do you mean we won 't see each other anymore ?
i will say them only once
don 't say them to anyone at all until you absolutely need them
it 's bloody monday
everything will be over in an instant
please take care of me
i will say only one thing
don 't speak to that guy no matter what happens
if you do you will be UNknown by him
you 'r e UNknown UNknown UNknown right ?
did your father contact you ?
honestly he killed a person and ran away
that must be some kind of mistake because my dad is
well if he contacts you could you call this number here please ?
i 'm UNknown from the police headquarter investigation section
this is UNknown
dad doesn 't come home that often
welcome home UNknown chan
try it !
let 's see i think he UNknown l come soon
dad won 't come home right ?
a detective came by earlier
dad killed a person and is being chased by the police
that must be a mistake !
there 's no way dad would do such a thing
i 'm sorry UNknown
what happened ?
who is it ?
right i ordered that
this must be some genetic information right ?
UNknown UNknown UNknown UNknown
by the way what happened to UNknown ?
please sit down
do you want to eat it ?
a young and beautiful woman coming here is rather welcome
UNknown is missing at the moment
UNknown into illegal channels ?
that must be a mistake
if you hear anything from UNknown could you please contact us ?
yes i will
stop UNknown into russia at once !
this is an official UNknown from UNknown i
dad told me the same thing
he contacted you ?
russia must be involved in this incident somehow
i might be able to prove my dad 's innocence
don 't say stupid things
your life UNknown l also be in danger if you continue
it 's better if you do not take this job lightly
it 's got nothing to do with you
this is a matter just between me and my father
moreover if an act of UNknown happens millions of people will die right ?
if i run away now it 's still the same
as expected of UNknown 's son
i will get authorization from chief UNknown
this is a free UNknown
do not UNknown in any UNknown UNknown get it free at d addicts com
please visit us at UNknown UNknown com UNknown
stop it !
get away !
i 'm preparing for a festival right now i 'm really busy
that means everything 's going well
everything except you that is
why do you think i let you go to falcon ?
falcon is wandering around russia 's military installations
it 's all right
also that kid is only
it 's better not to take falcon lightly
he recognized the bugs we planted right away
but we already got hold of the most important information
important information ?
if falcon catches a spoil in russia
judgment will be dealt
i already have back up for the required procedures
you know UNknown like that are expensive
i finally reached the target 's computer but it 's strange
it seems like someone invaded it before me
this guy bluebird
that 's why there are weak spots in the system
he made a wide gaping UNknown
i will break in now
yes i did it !
it looks like there are only system files
what could that be ?
can you UNknown it ?
i have only ten seconds for the UNknown
if it takes longer i will be caught
here we go
it 's slow this scrap machine !
capture complete !
first i have to find out the password 's UNknown method
it 's russian
go to school today
i 'm okay
though his father 's being chased he 's still going to school huh ?
that 's cute
that should be all right
well then UNknown chan you go first
i UNknown l come after you later so that the detective doesn 't see me
don 't worry i will protect you for sure UNknown chan
okay let 's go
wake up or i UNknown l get angry
come see me after class
here as an apology for last time
eh ? !
how is it ?
wow thank you !
you 'r e the only student who sleeps in my class
even though i did you a favor by especially wearing a short skirt
actually there 's a job i was asked to do
no but it 's a really important job
i have to hurry
i UNknown l excuse you for the next lesson somehow
frankly speaking it seems interesting
UNknown UNknown you 'r e a really interesting person
ah well then can i borrow that ?
say you can 't use the present i gave you ?
but i 'm afraid the wireless lan might be UNknown
hmm go ahead
i can transform the data with the password key
if i found the password key i 'd be able to put it back to its former state
how long will it take ?
even if you use a high performance computer a month and a half
that long ?
UNknown is a peer to peer file sharing program much like UNknown
well it 's like UNknown
using that i was able to create a powerful UNknown computer on the internet
on the internet there are millions of computers connected
and they 'r e not always using their full performance level all the time
if you connect them and split all the work between them this round robin UNknown me to go into offense
it 's like distributed UNknown
it 's here
is falcon flying ?
but don 't worry if it were the real thing
i would quickly
falcon has to become one of us
h h h UNknown help
what is this ?
it 's called bloody x
bloody x ?
the data that public safety special third division 's chief UNknown obtained in russia contained the dna base sequence that matched with bloody x
sensei if this virus were spread how many victims would there be ?
this virus spreads through the air easily floating from one person to the next
because of the really gruesome way of dying and the quick spreading the former soviet union abandoned the development of it as a chemical weapon
if the virus were spread the number of victims in the first week would be more than eight million people
eight million ? !
what about an UNknown virus ?
two years ago you should have started developing one
bloody x UNknown UNknown
knowing all this the ones who decided to abandon the development midway were all of you right ?
the terrorists are going to use this in japan the next time you said ?
it 's unlikely that UNknown will contact her during the UNknown
did something happen ?
hack into the system of UNknown 's electric power central control center
get me the administrator password
are you listening ?
don 't say ridiculous things !
ah you mustn 't tell anyone about this
the police are unreasonable you know ?
what is she doing ? !
it 's UNknown
it 's my fault
go to UNknown UNknown UNknown right away
the kidnapper should be UNknown him
because i didn 't listen to dad UNknown is
what happened UNknown ?
you promised to protect us didn 't you ?
don 't mess around !
i UNknown l apologize for not protecting her
but more important now is UNknown chan 's rescue
i attached a transmitter to her bag so we can locate her through UNknown
let 's go
we UNknown e followed them until UNknown
at the worst priority is given to the criminal 's life over the hostage 's
so you don 't care what happens to your sister right ?
what are you saying ?
are you listening ?
i will wait only ten minutes
only five minutes left
and now stand up
one two three four
i decided to work for that person
i UNknown e always lived with all my might
more than you !
thanks to you millions of people will die
millions of people ?
where are you right now ?
UNknown an UNknown drug
there 's nothing wrong with her
i think my wife will wake up soon too
thank you very much
i am sorry
it seems like he contacted him once because of the russian UNknown incident
that 's all ?
i told the criminal the administrator password to UNknown 's electric power central control center
you 'r e just UNknown kid
what are you saying ?
my little sister 's life doesn 't mean anything to you right ?
but she 's my precious little sister !
there wasn 't any other way to save her !
right now the UNknown are trying to invade the electric power central control center by using the UNknown UNknown and UNknown its program
do you understand what you UNknown e done ?
if that happens all of tokyo will experience a huge blackout !
there won 't be a blackout
i 'm different from you idiots
what did you just say ? !
i put a jail around the system
they can do nothing but struggle
we have succeeded in UNknown the control system
it would be nice if you 'd catch the UNknown during that time
you understand don 't you ?
it 's the UNknown UNknown !
we have to check which districts it supplies !
i can 't trust the things this kid says
the UNknown UNknown supplies electricity to the whole UNknown district
but what does the enemy want to achieve by causing a blackout ?
what 's the UNknown district 's population UNknown distribution in this time zone ?
i 'm looking it up right now
you don 't have any courtesy do you UNknown ?
the station or the subway system ?
those are surely possibilities
if there 's a blackout the air conditioning system will stop
if the air conditioning system stops they UNknown l have the best environment to spread the virus
actually this mall is in danger of a terrorist virus attack
to all units
inspect strange people trash boxes plants and such where there might be a virus weapon
make the withdrawal of equipment as fast as possible !
the break in force is on standby at the 2nd front gate within 50 metres
wait for instructions !
get the customers UNknown outside
at all costs we have to avoid panic
don 't play around kid
your job 's over right ?
it 's time for adults now !
get lost !
that brat said there wouldn 't be a blackout and there is one after all !
UNknown what 's the situation in the control room ?
no UNknown here
please wait a moment
from headquarter UNknown
UNknown there 's no answer from UNknown
head over to the emergency system room and confirm what 's going on there
someone has cut the supply from the UNknown UNknown UNknown
i UNknown l go check the situation there
UNknown UNknown let both groups head for each other
it could be the virus
to all units
main gate gate 2 blocked
UNknown the people on the main and shopping courts
letting down the fire UNknown shutters in mall blocks UNknown
the tokyo fire defense agency UNknown rescue will arrive in ten minutes
UNknown is leading them
i will now let the people outside
until we confirm the virus is real or not you must not let a single person outside !
from now on i want you to strictly abide by my orders !
calm down !
are you okay ?
public safety 's special third division 's UNknown
something virus like has been spread in this mall
it 's a possible terrorist attack
then the fire brigade will go in and collect some of the substance
please do so !
analysis result confirm the analysis result
there 's no reaction at the moment
with all those people in an uproar that 's impossible
UNknown san !
let us go !
open up !
it 's the worst case scenario isn 't it ?
a possible virus infection occurred inside the mall so they made the following decision
whatever happens don 't let people outside !
if it happens
we 'r e prepared to shoot !
wait a second chief !
this is an order UNknown !
if the virus was bloody x eight million people will lose their lives
but tokyo will vanish just like UNknown in russia
we won 't let that happen
i won 't give up till the last minute !
everyone inside is desperately fighting too !
don 't go out !
please don 't go outside !
those who try to
it 's not your fault
they directly attacked the UNknown UNknown to cause this blackout
it didn 't have anything to do with what you did
will everyone die ?
what are the people outside doing ?
why aren 't they rescuing us ?
it 's the opposite
if even one person in here gets out he UNknown l be the source of infection and will be responsible for millions of people 's deaths
this is what it means to protect something
idiot why didn 't you tell me earlier ?
where did the guy with the balloons go ?
this is it
the one dressed like a clown
let 's search for him !
our last duty before we die !
we have no choice but to open it !
let 's pull !
are you all right ?
out of the way !
out of the way !
it 's fake !
please stop !
soon the chosen ones will receive the real judgement
is there someone you want to kill ?
shopping mall had an explosion or UNknown gas uproar
turned out to be a prank the police are stupid
but nobody died what a pity
please sign here
i will kill that person for you
what are you doing ?
let 's go !
is UNknown all right ?
don 't worry the UNknown will be over soon
project leader UNknown chan

at the hospital
time limit is thirty minutes
who are you ?
is it ok ?
if that had been the real thing and there had been an infection
i don t even want to think about that
UNknown san !
i ve sent the real virus
the name is UNknown yukiko
the address is UNknown UNknown 1 26 9
it s falcon
why do you want him ?
secure UNknown UNknown !
yukiko s UNknown
turned to out to be a prank the police are stupid
but nobody died what a pity
based on the UNknown disease law your UNknown has been recommended
if you want to stop it hack into UNknown i and completely UNknown the copy of the christmas massacre data file
a complete UNknown is impossible !
you can do it falcon
if it s you
falcon has taken off
please take care of this
UNknown UNknown go to the server room !
third unit s UNknown
i wonder if bluebird could have done the same
capture falcon as planned
stop it !
please open your mouth
we are still examining
looking at the amount of explosive substance i presume it has a range of five meters
stop it !
there s no time left !
let go !
the festival has begun
come back !
orders are to be obeyed
i am sorry
i m planning to keep watching their movements
UNknown into UNknown i is real UNknown
it was you who involved us in this !
i will protect UNknown
the virus is bloody x
won t you eat a bit more ?
where are my examination results ?
when can i go home ? !
i will ask the doctor
could you lend me a computer ?
people are waiting for my posts
i will ask
8 46 pm
what that man said bothered us
but the examination was UNknown i s decision
that s the first infected person
in two to three hours the symptoms will show
she il start running a high fever and bleeding from from her nose mouth and every UNknown UNknown of her UNknown organs
what s the chance of saving her ?
UNknown yukiko didn t have a boyfriend and didn t stand out at her UNknown
writing in her UNknown seems to be her only hobby
we couldn t find any connection to the terrorists
it didn t matter who their victim was
they re continuing their rehearsal to test the virus destructive power next
if i were a terrorist i d do that
you re saying this as if you know
we will restore the system server soon
was the copy of the russian data the only thing he UNknown ?
yes but we don t know if we can recover it
UNknown UNknown is only a high school student
we can t risk him doing what the terrorists say if they threaten him again
it s dangerous for him to continue UNknown in the investigation
wouldn t it be better to protect him through isolation ?
and i don t care if it s a little extreme
you want to use him as bait ?
the probability of UNknown UNknown UNknown him is also high
moreover we have very little information on the terrorists
so we have to rely on that
why are you getting cold feet ?
attack is the best defense isn t it ?
you re digging your own grave by thinking like that
to be used by a high UNknown don t you have any pride ?
disorder in an organization s command system eventually leads to its collapse
don t let a spy like UNknown UNknown get out again
i already made a proposal to the chief cabinet secretary
perhaps this time we can expect good communication
it s probably too late
nothing abnormal showed up in the examination results
i see what a relief
let s go home
12 14 am
part time work ?
you should sleep properly
we il know for sure if we stay here
more importantly please protect UNknown
sorry but our job is to arrest a murderer
you don t need to worry
i don t need to worry right ?
are you all right ?
we il amputate your arm
what is it ?
what happened to your father was terrible
there s no way he would do something like that
yeah that s right
well well we re your friends from the newspaper club
a school friend fighting against adversity believing in his father protecting his little sister
how s that for a UNknown ?
we il take this up in this month s issue
let s dig out the truth behind this incident and prove your father s innocence okay ?
look you re also worried about UNknown chan s health
we can all help you
it s got nothing to do with you
what is it ?
the files were UNknown here too
i il restore them now
i found it ; this is it
massacre during christmas
on christmas last year there was a virus terror attack in russia
last night the terrorists ordered me to hack and UNknown this data
that s why there must be an important secret hidden in this data
i il copy it
to bring in a murderous virus like that
what the hell were you doing ? !
because of your failure she will die here alone without knowing anything !
at least watch over her until her last moment
watch and burn it into your mind !
excuse my rudeness but where were you and what were you doing on christmas eve last year ?
why this suddenly ?
what happened ?
do you have the membership card for that store ?
what s going on ?
can i borrow this ?
by the way the woman in the data earlier wasn t UNknown sensei
we were 100 wrong
and she was alone
it s all right
she s got an alibi
as i thought i am dying
yes it s within the limits
there s no problem
please give your stupid male students another chance !
hey UNknown !
sensei is there something you would like to eat ?
i know a good restaurant
i m going to the ladies room for a bit
i had a great life
did she run out of material and so said she died ?
if you would just die
4 34 am
she wasn t just a patient she was UNknown yukiko
you re right
the key s experiment succeeded
start the preparations for the festival
the door has been opened
festival of blood
she s the first victim
idiot hurry and run !
i can t let it end here bye
UNknown UNknown what happened ?
eh is it a burglar ?
then sensei i il go first
how is it ?
seems like it was a UNknown
that s good to hear
UNknown UNknown what happened ?
ah yes i lost my wallet
i think it s here somewhere
that s great
we went out to eat together
ah you re back already ?
i il try to call him now
ah UNknown ?
she s with me right now
it s a dangerous atmosphere
i might get attacked by sensei !
is it ?
is it in another room ?
i il go look for it
ah that s okay
ah you re right
isn t it ?
you seem worried about something in that room
is something there ?
on december 24th of last year
asking where you were that day doesn t have any meaning
because christmas in russia is on january 7th right ?
UNknown told me

let 's in the control tower
tis now struck twelve get thee to bed francisco
for this relief much thanks
tis bitter cold and i am sick at heart
have you had quiet guard ?
not a mouse stirring
give you good night
bernardo has my place
a piece of him
what has this thing appeared again tonight ?
i have seen nothing
touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us
therefore i have UNknown him along with us to watch the minutes of this night that if again the apparition come he may approve our eyes and speak to it
tush tush 't will not appear
then let us once again UNknown your ears that are so fortified against our story what we have two nights seen
well let us hear bernardo speak of this
in the same figure like the king that 's dead
thou art a scholar speak to it horatio
looks it not like the king ?
mark it horatio
it would be spoke to
question it horatio
by heaven i charge thee speak !
it is offended
tis gone and will not answer
before my god i might not this believe without the sensible and true UNknown of mine own eyes
thus twice before and jump at this dead hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch
in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion this UNknown some strange UNknown to our state
who is 't that can inform me ?
that can i at least the whisper goes so
our last king whose image even but now appear 'd to us
i UNknown l cross it though it blast me
stay illusion !
if thou art UNknown to thy country 's fate which happily UNknown may avoid o speak !
do if it will not stand
tis here !
for it is as is the air UNknown and our vain blows malicious mockery
it was about to speak when the cock crew
and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons
it faded on the crowing of the cock
so have i heard and do in part believe it
but look the morn in UNknown mantle clad walks o UNknown r the dew of UNknown high UNknown hill
break we our watch up and by my advice
let us UNknown what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him
though yet of hamlet our dear brother 's death the memory be green
and that it us UNknown to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe
yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves
for all our thanks
so much for him
we have here writ
and we here dispatch you good cornelia and UNknown as our ambassadors to old norway
in that and in all things we show our duty
we doubt it nothing
you told us of some suit what is 't laertes ?
what says UNknown ?
i do beseech you give him leave to go
take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will !
but now our cousin hamlet and our son
a little more than kin and less than kind
how is it that the clouds still hang on you ?
not so my lord i am too much i the sun
good hamlet cast thy UNknown colour off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark
do not for ever with thy UNknown ed UNknown seek for thy noble father in the dust
thou know 's t 't is common all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity
ay madam it is common
if it be why seems it so particular with thee ?
seems madam !
tis not alone my UNknown cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black together with all forms moods shapes of grief that can UNknown me truly
these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play
but i have that within which UNknown show these but the UNknown and the suits of woe
tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father
but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do UNknown sorrow
but to UNknown in obstinate UNknown is a course of UNknown stubbornness
tis UNknown grief
UNknown UNknown it is most UNknown to our desire
and i beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our UNknown UNknown cousin and our son
let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet
i pray thee stay with us go not to UNknown
i shall in all my best obey you madam
why 't is a loving and a fair reply
be as UNknown in denmark
but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell re speaking earthly thunder
thaw and resolve itself into a dew !
or that the everlasting had not fix 'd his canon UNknown UNknown self slaughter !
o god !
fie on 't !
things rank and gross in nature possess it merely
that it should come to this !
but two months dead nay not so much not two !
so excellent a king that was to this
UNknown to a UNknown
that he might not UNknown the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly
heaven and earth !
let me not think on 't
UNknown thy name is woman !
a little month or UNknown re those shoes were old with which she follow 'd my poor father 's body
like UNknown all tears why she even she !
o god !
married with my uncle
ere yet the salt of most UNknown tears had left the flushing in her UNknown eyes she married
o most wicked speed to post with such UNknown to UNknown sheets !
it is not nor it cannot come to good
but break my heart for i must hold my tongue
hail to your lordship !
i am glad to see thee well
the same my lord and your poor servant ever
sir my good friend i UNknown l change that name with you
and what make you from UNknown horatio ?
good even sir
we UNknown l teach you to drink deep ere you depart
my lord i came to see your father 's funeral
i pray thee do not mock me fellow student
i think it was to see my mother 's wedding
indeed my lord it follow 'd hard upon
UNknown UNknown horatio !

i shall not look upon his like again
saw who ?
the king my father !
season your admiration with an UNknown ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you
for god 's love let me hear
two nights together had these gentlemen
marcellus and bernardo on their watch in the dead vast and middle of the night been thus encounter 'd
a figure like your father
armed at point exactly cap a UNknown appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and UNknown by them
this to me
i knew your father these hands are not more like
but where was this ?
my lord upon the platform where we watch 'd
did you not speak to it ?
my lord i did but answer made it none
't is very strange
and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it
hold you the watch tonight ?
we do my lord
arm 'd my lord
my lord from head to foot
then saw you not his face ?
o yes my lord he wore his beaver up
what look 'd he UNknown ?
a countenance more in sorrow than in anger
pale or red ?
it would have much amazed you
very like very like
while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred
his beard was UNknown ?
it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silver 'd
i will watch tonight perchance 't will walk again
i warrant it will
i UNknown l speak to it though hell itself should UNknown and bid me hold my peace
i pray you all if you have UNknown conceal 'd this sight
let it be UNknown in your silence still and whatsoever else shall hap to night give it an understanding but no tongue
i will UNknown your loves
so fare you well
my father 's spirit in arms !
all is not well
would the night were come !
till then sit still my soul
foul deeds will rise though all the earth o UNknown UNknown them to men 's eyes
my UNknown are embark 'd
do you doubt that ?
for hamlet and the trifling of his favour hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of UNknown nature
forward not permanent sweet not lasting
the perfume and UNknown of a minute no more
no more but so ?
think it no more
but you must fear his greatness weigh 'd his will is not his own
for he himself is subject to his birth
he may not as UNknown persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the safety and the health of this whole state
and therefore must his choice be UNknown unto the voice and UNknown of that body UNknown he is the head
to his UNknown 'd UNknown
fear it ophelia !
be wary then
youth to itself rebels though none else near
i shall the effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart
a double blessing is a double grace occasion smiles upon a second leave
yet here laertes !
the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stay 'd for
there my blessing with thee !
and these few UNknown in thy memory see thou character
give thy thoughts no tongue nor any UNknown thought his act
be thou familiar but by no means vulgar
those friends thou hast and their adoption tried UNknown them to thy soul with UNknown of steel
but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each new hatch 'd UNknown comrade
give every man thy ear but few thy voice take each man 's UNknown but reserve thy judgment
costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not express 'd in fancy !
rich not UNknown for the UNknown oft UNknown the man
neither a UNknown nor a lender be for loan oft loses both itself and friend
and borrowing UNknown the edge of UNknown
this above all
and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man
most humbly do i take my leave my lord
the time invites you go your servant tends
tis in my memory lock 'd and you yourself shall keep the key of it
so please you something touching the lord hamlet
marry well UNknown
given private time to you and you yourself have of your audience been most free and UNknown
give me up the truth
he hath my lord of late made many UNknown of his affection to me
do you believe his UNknown as you call them ?
i do not know my lord what i should think
marry i UNknown l teach you
think yourself a baby
tender yourself more dearly or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase running it thus you UNknown l tender me a fool
my lord he hath UNknown me with love in honourable fashion
ay fashion you may call it go to go to
and hath given countenance to his speech my lord with almost all the holy vows of heaven
ay UNknown to catch UNknown
i do know when the blood burns how prodigal the soul
lends the tongue vows
this is for all
look to 't i charge you
come your ways
the air bites UNknown it is very cold
it is a UNknown and an eager air
what hour now ?
no it is struck
the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse
keeps UNknown and the swaggering up spring reels
and as he drains his UNknown of UNknown down
the kettle drum and trumpet thus UNknown out
the triumph of his pledge
is it a custom ?
ay marry is 't
angels and ministers of grace defend us !
be thou a spirit of health or UNknown damn 'd ?
bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell ?
be thy UNknown wicked or charitable thou UNknown in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee
i UNknown l call thee hamlet
king father royal dane
why the UNknown wherein we saw thee quietly UNknown 'd hath UNknown his UNknown and marble jaws to cast thee up again
it UNknown you to go away with it
as if it some UNknown did desire to you alone
it waves you to a more removed ground
but do not go with it
no by no means
do not my lord
i do not set my life in a pin 's fee
and for my soul what can it do to that being a thing immortal as itself ?
it waves me forth again i UNknown l follow it
you shall not go my lord
hold off your hands !
be ruled you shall not go
my fate cries out and makes each petty artery in this body as hardy as the UNknown lion 's nerve
still am i call 'd
unhand me gentlemen
i say away !
he UNknown desperate with imagination
let 's follow 't is not fit thus to obey him
something is rotten in the state of denmark
heaven will direct it
speak i UNknown l go no further
alas poor ghost !
speak i am bound to hear
so art thou to revenge when thou dost hear
i could a tale unfold whose UNknown word would UNknown up thy soul freeze thy young blood make thy two eyes like stars start from their UNknown
but this eternal UNknown must not be to ears of flesh and blood
list list o list !
if thou didst ever thy dear father love
o god ! revenge his foul and most unnatural murder
haste me to know 't that i with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love may sweep to my revenge
i find thee apt
but know thou noble youth
the serpent that did sting thy father 's life now wears his crown
o my UNknown soul !
my uncle !
o hamlet what a falling off was there !
from me whose love was of that dignity that it went hand in hand even with the vow
i made to her in marriage and to decline upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor to those of mine !
but lust though to a radiant angel link 'd will UNknown itself in a celestial bed and prey on garbage
but soft !
brief let me be
thus was i sleeping by a brother 's hand of life of crown and queen at once dispatch 'd
o horrible !
let not the royal bed of denmark be a couch for luxury and damned UNknown
but UNknown thou UNknown this act taint not thy mind nor let thy soul UNknown against thy mother aught
leave her to heaven and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge to prick and sting her
fare thee well at once !
the glow worm shows the UNknown to be near and UNknown ins to pale his UNknown fire
adieu adieu !
o all you host of heaven !
o earth !
o fie !
remember thee ? !
remember thee ? !
i UNknown l wipe away all trivial fond records
all saws of books all forms all UNknown past that youth and observation copied there
and thy commandment all alone shall live within the book and volume of my brain UNknown 'd with UNknown matter
yes by heaven !
o villain villain smiling damned villain !
my tables meet it is i set it down that one may smile and smile and be a villain
so uncle there you are
now to my word
heaven secure him !
UNknown ho ho boy !
come bird come
what news my lord ?
o wonderful !
no you UNknown l reveal it
not i my lord by heaven
nor i my lord
would heart of man once think it ?
but you UNknown l be secret ?
ay by heaven my lord
there 's ne UNknown r a villain dwelling in all denmark but he 's an UNknown knave
there needs no ghost come from the grave to tell us this
why right you are i the right
and so without more circumstance at all i hold it fit that we shake hands and part
you as your business and desire shall point you for every man has business and desires such as it is and for mine own poor part
look you i UNknown l go pray
these are but wild and whirling words my lord
i 'm sorry they offend you heartily
yes UNknown UNknown heartily
yes by saint patrick but there is horatio and much offence too
touching this vision here it is an honest ghost that let me tell you for your desire to know what is between us
o UNknown UNknown 't as you may
and now good friends as you are friends scholars and soldiers give me one poor request
what is 't my lord ?
nay but swear it
nor i my lord in faith
upon my sword
indeed upon my sword indeed
art thou there UNknown ?
come on you hear this fellow in the UNknown consent to swear
propose the oath my lord
never to speak of this that you have seen swear by my sword
come hither gentlemen and lay your hands again upon my sword
never to speak of this that you have heard
swear by my sword
canst work i the earth so fast ?
a worthy pioneer !
o day and night but this is wondrous strange !
and therefore as a stranger give it welcome
there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in our philosophy
but come !
this not to do so grace and mercy at your most need help you swear !
loud UNknown volce
the time is out of joint
o cursed spite
give my son this money and these notes UNknown
i will my lord
my lord i did intend it
marry well said very well said
and in part him
ay very well my lord
and in part him but you may say not well
but if 't be he i mean he 's very wild
addicted so and so and there put on him what UNknown you please
ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling UNknown you may go so far
my lord that would UNknown him
faith no as you may season it in the charge
but my good lord
ay my lord i would know that
marry sir here 's my drift and i believe it is a fetch of wit
very good my lord
by the mass i was about to say something
where did i leave ?
at closes in the consequence
at closes in the consequence ?
ay marry !
i saw him yesterday or t other day
or then or then with such or such
and as you say there was a gaming
there a falling out at tennis or perchance
i saw him enter such a house of sale
UNknown a brothel or so forth
see you now your bait of UNknown takes this carp of truth and thus do we of wisdom and of reach by UNknown find directions out
you have me have you not ?
my lord i have
good my lord !
i shall my lord
well my lord
o my lord my lord i have been so UNknown !
with what i the name of god ?
my lord as i was sewing in my closet
my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it
what said he ?
for out o doors he went without their help and to the last UNknown their light on me
i am sorry
no my good lord but as you did command
i did repel his UNknown and denied his access to me
that hath made him mad
i am sorry that with better heed and judgment
i had not quoted him
i fear 'd he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee but UNknown my jealousy !
come go we to the king
this must be known
moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending
something have you heard of hamlet 's transformation
what it should be more than his father 's death that thus hath put him so much from the understanding of himself we cannot dream of
but we both obey and here give up ourselves in the full bent to lay our service freely at your feet to be commanded
thanks UNknown and gentle UNknown
thanks UNknown and gentle UNknown
and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changed son
go some of you and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is
heavens make our presence and our UNknown pleasant and helpful to him !
ay amen !
thou still hast been the father of good news
have i my lord ?
i assure my good liege i hold my duty as i hold my soul both to my god and to my gracious king
and i do think that i have found the very cause of hamlet 's lunacy
o speak of that that do i long to hear
first give UNknown to the ambassadors my news shall be the fruit unto the feast
thyself do grace to them and bring them in
he tells me my sweet gertrude that he hath found the head and source of all your son 's UNknown
i doubt it is no other but the main his father 's death and our o UNknown UNknown marriage
we will UNknown him
most fair return of greetings and desires
he sent out to suppress his nephew 's march
the which he thought proposed against the poles but better look 'd into he truly found it was against your highness and our state
so UNknown receives UNknown from him and vows before his uncle never more to give UNknown of arms against denmark here
most welcome home !
my liege and madam to UNknown what majesty should be what duty is why day is day night night and time is time
were nothing but to waste night day and time
therefore since UNknown is the soul of wit and UNknown the limbs and outward UNknown
i will be brief
but let that go
madam i swear i use no art at all
that he is mad 't is true tis true 't is pity and pity 't is 't is true a foolish figure
but farewell it for i will use no art
i have a daughter have while she is mine who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this
now gather and surmise
that 's an ill phrase a vile phrase
UNknown is a vile phrase but you shall hear
he UNknown etc
good madam stay awhile i will be faithful
doubt thou the stars are fire doubt that the sun doth move
doubt truth to be a liar but never doubt i love
this in obedience hath my daughter shown me and more above
but how hath she received his love ?
what do you think of me ?
as of a friend faithful and honourable
i would fain prove so
but what might you think
when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i UNknown it i must tell you that before my daughter told me what might you
or my dear majesty your queen here think
if i had given my heart a UNknown mute and dumb or look 'd upon this love with idle sight ?
no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did UNknown
lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star
this must not be
which done she took the fruits of my advice
do you think 't is this ?
it may be very likely
hath there been such a time i 'd fain know that that i have positively said tis so when it proved otherwise ?
not that i know
if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the centre
how may we try this further ?
you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby
so he does indeed
be you and i behind an arras then mark the encounter
if he love her not
and be not from his reason fallen UNknown
let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and UNknown
we will try it
sweet gertrude leave us
i shall obey you
i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlet 's UNknown
so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his UNknown way again to both your honours
madam i wish it may
ophelia walk you here
i hear him coming
to be or not to be that is the question
whether 't is nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles
and by opposing end them ?
to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heart ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to
tis a UNknown UNknown to be wish 'd
to die to sleep
ay there 's the rub
for in that sleep of death what dreams may come
when we have UNknown off this mortal coil must give us pause
there 's the respect that makes calamity of so long life
for who would bear the whips and UNknown of time but that the dread of something after death ?
the UNknown 'd country from whose UNknown no traveller returns puzzles the will
and makes us rather bear those UNknown we have than fly to others that we know not of ?
thus conscience does make cowards of us all
soft you now !
good my lord how does your honour for this many a day ?
i humbly thank you well well well
my lord i have UNknown of yours that i have long ed long to re deliver
i pray you now receive them
not i i never gave you aught
mine honour 'd lord you know right well you did and with them words of so sweet breath composed as made the things more rich
their perfume lost take these again for to the noble mind rich gifts wax poor when UNknown prove unkind
there my lord
i did love you once
indeed my lord you made me believe so
you should not have believed me i loved you not
i was the more deceived
get thee to a UNknown
why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners ?
i am myself indifferent honest and yet i could accuse me of such things it were better my mother had not borne me
what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven ?
we are UNknown knaves all believe none of us
go thy ways to a UNknown
where 's your father ?
at home my lord
if thou dost marry i UNknown l give you this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape UNknown
get thee to a UNknown go farewell
or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them
to a UNknown go and quickly too
you jig you UNknown and you UNknown and nick name god 's creatures and make your UNknown your ignorance
go to i UNknown l no more on 't it hath made me mad
i say we will have no more marriages
those that are married already all but one shall live the rest shall keep as they are
to a UNknown go
the UNknown 's soldier 's scholar 's eye tongue sword
the UNknown and rose of the fair state the glass of fashion and the mould of form the observed of all UNknown quite quite down !
and i of ladies most UNknown and wretched that suck 'd the honey of his music vows now see that noble and most sovereign reason
like sweet bells UNknown out of tune and harsh
that UNknown 'd form and feature of blown youth blasted with ecstasy
o woe is me to have seen what i have seen see what i see !
there 's something in his soul o UNknown r which his melancholy sits on brood and i do think the hatch and the disclose will be some danger
how now ophelia !
away i do beseech you here he comes
i UNknown l bore him presently
how does my good lord hamlet ?
excellent well you are a UNknown
not i my lord
honest my lord !
that 's very true my lord
for if the sun breed UNknown in a dead dog being a god kissing carrion
have you a daughter ?
i have my lord
conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive
friend look to 't
still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i was a UNknown
he is far gone far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much UNknown for love very near this
i UNknown l speak to him again
what do you read my lord ?
between who ?
UNknown sir for the UNknown rogue says here that old men have grey beards
that their faces are wrinkled
their eyes UNknown thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a most UNknown lack of wit well together with most weak hams
all which sir though i most UNknown and UNknown believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down
for you yourself sir should be as old as i am if like a crab you could go backward
though this be madness yet there is method in 't
will you walk out of the air my lord ?
into my grave ?
how pregnant sometimes his replies are !
my honourable lord i will most humbly take my leave of you
you cannot sir take from me anything that i would more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life
fare you well my lord
these tedious old fools !
you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is
god save you sir !
my honoured lord !
my excellent good friends !
how dost thou UNknown ?
ah UNknown !
as the indifferent children of the earth
happy in that we are not over happy
on fortune 's cap we are not the very button
nor the soles of her shoe ?
neither my lord
faith her UNknown we
most true she is a strumpet
what 's the news ?
none my lord but that the world 's grown honest
then is doomsday near !
but your news is not true
let me question more in particular
what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither ?
prison my lord ?
a UNknown one in which there are many UNknown wards and dungeons
denmark being one o the worst
we think not so my lord
why then 't is none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so
to me it 's a prison
why then your ambition makes it one
tis too narrow for your mind
shall we to the court ?
we UNknown l wait upon you
no such matter
but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at UNknown ?
to visit you my lord no other occasion
were you not sent for ?
is it your own UNknown ?
a free UNknown ?
come nay speak !
why anything but to the purpose
you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your UNknown have not craft enough to colour
i know the good king and queen have sent for you
to what end my lord ?
that you must teach me
but let me UNknown you by the rights of our fellowship be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no ?
what say you ?
if you love me hold not off
my lord we were sent for
i will tell you why
so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen UNknown no feather
i have of late but wherefore i know not
lost all my UNknown
and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this UNknown frame the earth seems to me a sterile UNknown this most excellent canopy the air
how noble in reason !
how infinite in faculty !
in form and moving how express and admirable !
in action how like an angel !
in UNknown how like a god !
the beauty of the world !
the UNknown of animals !
and yet to me what is this UNknown of dust ?
man delights not me
my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts
why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me ?
to think my lord if you delight not in man what UNknown entertainment the players shall receive from you
we UNknown them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service
what players are they ?
even those you were wont to take delight in the UNknown of the city
he that plays the king shall be welcome
his majesty shall have tribute of me
car horn there are the players
gentlemen you are welcome to UNknown
come then your hands
in what my dear lord ?
i am but mad north north west
when the wind is UNknown i know an 'a UNknown from an 'a UNknown
well be with you gentlemen !
hark you UNknown and you too
at each ear a UNknown
that great baby you see there is not yet out of his UNknown UNknown
happily he 's the second time come to them for they say an old man is twice a child
i will UNknown he comes to tell me of the players mark it
you say right sir monday morning 't was so indeed
my lord i have news to tell you
my lord i have news to tell you !
when UNknown was an actor in rome
the actors are come hither my lord
buzz buzz !
the best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy history UNknown UNknown comical historical UNknown UNknown historical UNknown comical historical UNknown scene UNknown or poem unlimited
seneca cannot be too heavy nor UNknown too light
o UNknown judge of israel what a treasure UNknown thou !
what a treasure had he my lord ?
why one fair daughter and no more the which he loved passing well
still on my daughter
if you call me UNknown my lord i have a daughter that i love passing well
nay that follows not
you are welcome masters welcome all
i am glad to see thee well
welcome good friends
what my young lady and mistress !
by 'r lady your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when i last saw you
pray god your voice be not cracked within the ring
we UNknown l have a speech straight
come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech
what speech my lord ?
i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million
twas UNknown to the general
one speech in it i chiefly loved 't was UNknown tale to UNknown and UNknown of it especially where he speaks of priam 's slaughter
if it live in your memory begin at this line
let me see let me see
the rugged UNknown like the UNknown beast it is not so
it begins with UNknown the rugged UNknown
he whose sable arms
when he lay couch ed in the ominous horse
hath now this dread and black complexion smear 'd
with UNknown more dismal head to foot
now is he total
and thus o UNknown r sized with UNknown UNknown
with eyes like UNknown the hellish UNknown
UNknown match 'd
then senseless UNknown
and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing
but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the UNknown below as hush as death
anon the dreadful thunder doth UNknown the region so after UNknown pause UNknown ed vengeance sets him new a work
and never did the cyclops hammers fall on mars his UNknown forged for proof UNknown with less remorse than UNknown bleeding sword now falls on priam
this is too long
prithee say on
say on come to UNknown
the UNknown queen ?
and for a robe about her UNknown and all o UNknown r UNknown loins
a blanket in the alarm of fear caught up
who this had seen with tongue in venom steep 'd
UNknown fortune 's state would treason have pronounced
pray you no more
do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstract and brief UNknown of the time
my lord i will use them according to their desert
god 's UNknown man much better !
use every man after his desert and who should 's cape whipping ?
dost thou hear me old friend ?
can you play the murder of UNknown ?
ay my lord
you could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which i would set down and insert in 't could you not ?
ay my lord
you are welcome to UNknown
good my lord !
now i am alone
for UNknown !
what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have ?
like john a 'd UNknown UNknown of my cause and can say nothing
no not for a king upon whose property and most dear life a damn 'd defeat was made
am i a coward ?
who calls me villain ?
breaks my UNknown across ?
UNknown off my beard and blows it in my face ?
UNknown me by the nose ?
gives me the lie i the throat as deep as to the lungs ?
who does me this ?
i should have fatted all the region kites with this slave 's UNknown
bloody UNknown villain !
o vengeance !
this is most brave
i UNknown l have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle
i UNknown l observe his looks i UNknown l tent him to the quick
if he but UNknown
yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits UNknown me to damn me
i UNknown l have grounds more relative than this
the play 's the thing wherein i UNknown l catch the conscience of the king
and can you by no drift of conference get from him why he puts on this confusion ?
he does confess he feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak
nor do we find him forward to be sounded but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state
did he receive you well ?
most like a gentleman
UNknown of question but of our demands most free in his reply
did you UNknown him ?
to any pastime ?
with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him thus inclined
good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights
we shall my lord
he shall with speed to england
UNknown the seas and countries different with UNknown objects will expel
this something settled matter in his heart UNknown his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself
what think you on 't ?
it shall do well but yet do i believe
the origin and UNknown of his grief sprung from neglected love
my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play
let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief
let her be round with him and i UNknown l be placed so please you in the ear
of all their conference
it shall be so
speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to you UNknown on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of your players do
i had as UNknown the town UNknown spoke my lines
it out UNknown herod
suit the action to the word the word to the action
with this special UNknown that you o UNknown UNknown not the modesty of nature
o reform it altogether
go make you ready
will the king hear this piece of work ?
and the queen too and that presently
bid the players make haste
we will my lord
horatio thou art e UNknown n as just a man as e UNknown r my conversation UNknown withal
o my dear lord
dost thou hear ?
give me that man that is not passion 's slave and i will wear him in my heart 's core ay in my heart of heart as i do thee
something too much of this
there is a play tonight before the king
one scene of it comes near the circumstance which i have told thee of my father 's death
i prithee when thou UNknown that act afoot even with the very comment of thy soul observe mine uncle
if his UNknown guilt do not itself UNknown in one speech it is a damned ghost that we have seen and my UNknown are as foul as UNknown 's smithy
well my lord if he steal aught the whilst this play is playing and 's cape UNknown i will pay the theft
i must be idle
how fares our cousin hamlet ?
excellent i faith of the UNknown 's dish i eat the air promise crammed
i have nothing with this answer hamlet these words are not mine
no nor mine now
that did i my lord and was accounted a good actor
what did you UNknown ?
i did UNknown julius caesar
i was killed i the capitol
brutus killed me
be the players ready ?
ay my lord they stay upon your patience
come hither my dear hamlet sit by me
no good mother here 's metal more attractive
o ho !
lady shall i lie in your lap ?
no my lord
ay my lord
i think nothing my lord
that 's a fair thought
to lie between maids legs
what is my lord ?
who i ?
what should a man do but be merry ?
for look how cheerfully my mother looks and my father died these two hours
nay 't is twice two months my lord
so long ?
o heavens !
marry this is UNknown UNknown
it means mischief
we shall know by this fellow the players cannot keep counsel
they UNknown l tell all
for us and for our tragedy
here UNknown to your clemency we beg your hearing patiently
is this a prologue or the UNknown of a ring ?
tis brief my lord
so many journeys may the sun and moon make us again count o UNknown r ere love be done !
faith i must leave thee love and shortly too
my UNknown powers their functions leave to do
and thou shalt live in this fair world behind honour 'd beloved and UNknown one as kind for husband shalt thou
o confound the rest !
such love must needs be treason in my breast
in second husband let me be UNknown !
none wed the second but who kill 'd the first
a second time i kill my husband dead when second husband kisses me in bed
i do believe you think what now you speak but what we do determine oft we break
so think thou wilt no second husband wed but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead
nor earth to me give food nor heaven light !
sport and repose lock from me day and night !
both here and hence pursue me lasting strife if once a widow ever i be wife !
if she should break it now !
tis deeply sworn
my spirits grow dull and fain i would UNknown the tedious day with sleep
sleep rock thy brain and never come UNknown between us twain !
madam how like you this play ?
the lady doth protest too much methinks
have you heard the argument ?
is there no offence in 't ?
no no they do but jest poison in jest
no offence i the world
what do you call the play ?
the mouse trap
UNknown is the duke 's name his wife UNknown
you shall see anon
your majesty and we that have free souls it touches us not
let the gall ed jade UNknown our withers are UNknown
ah this is one UNknown nephew to the king
you are as good as a chorus my lord
i could interpret between you and your love if i could see the puppets UNknown
you are keen my lord you are keen
come the UNknown raven doth UNknown for revenge
thoughts black hands apt drugs fit and time agreeing
confederate season else no creature seeing
thou mixture rank of midnight weeds collected with UNknown 's ban thrice blasted thrice infected
thy natural magic and dire property on wholesome life UNknown immediately
he poisons him in the garden for his estate
his name 's UNknown
you shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of UNknown 's wife
the king rises
how fares my lord ?
give o UNknown r the play
give me some light
didst perceive ?
i did very well note him
come some music !
good my lord UNknown me a word with you
sir a whole history
is in his retirement marvellous UNknown
with drink sir ?
good my lord put your discourse into some frame and start not so wildly from my affair
i am tame sir
you are welcome
oh oh oh sir i cannot
what my lord ?
my wit 's diseased
then thus she says your behavior hath struck her into wonder and UNknown
o wonderful son that can so UNknown a mother !
we shall obey were she ten times our mother
have you any further trade with us ?
my lord you once did love me
so i do still by these pickers and UNknown
good my lord what is your cause of UNknown ?
you do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your UNknown to your friend
sir i lack advancement
ay but sir while the grass grows
the proverb is something musty
o the recorder !
o my lord if my duty be too bold my love is too UNknown
i do not well understand that
will you play upon this pipe ?
my lord i cannot
tis as easy as lying
govern these UNknown with your fingers and thumb give it breath with your mouth and it will discourse most eloquent music
look you these are the stops
but these cannot i command to any UNknown of harmony
i have not the skill
why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of me !
you would play upon me
you would seem to know my stops
you would pluck out the heart of my mystery
call me what instrument you will though you can fret me
you cannot play upon me
god bless you sir !
my lord the queen would speak with you
they play UNknown and presently !
do you see yonder cloud that 's almost in shape of a camel ?
by the mass and 't is like a camel indeed
methinks it is like a weasel
it is backed like a weasel
or like a whale ?
very like a whale
they fool me to the top of my bent
i will come by and by
i will say so
leave me friends
tis now the very UNknown time of night when UNknown yawn and hell itself breathes out UNknown to this world
now could i drink hot blood and do such bitter business as the day would quake to look on
i like him not nor stands it safe with us to let his madness range
therefore prepare you
the terms of our estate may not endure hazard so dangerous as doth UNknown grow out of his lunacy
we will ourselves provide
never alone did the king sigh but with a general groan
for majesty is like a UNknown wheel fix 'd on the summit of the highest mount to whose huge UNknown 10 000 lesser things are UNknown and UNknown 'd
arm you i pray you to this speedy voyage for we will UNknown put upon this fear which now goes too free footed
we will haste us
behind the arras i UNknown l convey myself to hear the process i UNknown l warrant she UNknown l tax him home
fare you well my liege
i UNknown l call upon you ere you go to bed and tell you what i know
thanks dear my lord
it smells to heaven
pray can i not though inclination be as sharp as will my stronger guilt UNknown my strong intent
and like a man to double business bound
i stand in pause where i shall first begin and both neglect
what if this UNknown ed hand were thicker than itself with brother 's blood ?
is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens to wash it white as snow ?
UNknown serves mercy but to confront the UNknown of offence ?
and what 's in prayer but this two fold force to be UNknown ere we come to fall or pardon 'd being down ?
then i UNknown l look up
my fault is past
forgive me my foul murder ?
that cannot be since i am still possess 'd of those effects for which i did the murder my crown mine own ambition and my queen
may one be pardon 'd and retain the offence ?
what then ?
but what can it when one cannot repent ?
o wretched state !
o lime ed soul that struggling to be free art more engaged !
help angels !
all may yet be well
now he is praying
and so he goes to heaven and so am i UNknown
that would be UNknown 'd
a villain kills my father and for that
i his sole son do this same villain send to heaven ?
o this is hire and salary not revenge
he took my father UNknown full of bread with all his crimes broad blown as flush as may
and how his UNknown stands who knows save heaven ?
am i then UNknown to take him in the UNknown of his soul when he is fit and season 'd for his passage ?
my mother stays
my words fly up my thoughts remain below
words without thoughts never to heaven go
he will come straight
tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with
and that your grace hath screen 'd and stood between
much heat and him
pray you be round with him
knock at door
withdraw i hear him coming
hamlet thou hast thy father much offended
mother you have my father much offended
come come you answer with an idle tongue
go go you question with a wicked tongue
why how now hamlet !
what 's the matter now ?
have you forgot me ?
no by the UNknown not so
you are the queen your husband 's brother 's wife and would it were not so ! you are my mother
nay then i UNknown l set those to you that can speak
come come and sit you down you shall not budge
you go not till i set you up a glass where you may see the UNknown part of you
what wilt thou do ?
thou wilt not murder me !
help help ho !
nay i know not
o what a rash and bloody deed is this !
a bloody deed !
as kill a king !
ay lady 't was my word
thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell !
i took thee for thy better
take thy fortune
what have i done that thou UNknown wag thy tongue in noise so rude against me ?
such an act
calls virtue hypocrite makes marriage vows as false as UNknown oaths
ay me what act that roars so loud and UNknown in the index ?
look here upon this picture and on this
the counterfeit UNknown of two brothers
see what a grace was seated on this brow
UNknown 's curls the front of jove himself
an eye like mars to threaten and command
here is your husband like a UNknown 'd ear blasting his wholesome brother
have you eyes ?
eyes without feeling feeling without sight ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all or but a sickly part of one true sense
could not so UNknown
o hamlet speak no more
thou turn 's t mine eyes into my very soul and there i see such black and grain ed spots as will not leave their UNknown
nay but to live in the rank sweat of an UNknown ed bed stew 'd in corruption UNknown and making love over the nasty sty
o speak to me no more !
these words like daggers enter in mine ears
no more sweet hamlet !
a murderer and a villain
a slave that is not twentieth part the UNknown of your precedent lord
a vice of kings a UNknown of the empire and the rule who from a shelf the precious UNknown stole and put it in his pocket !
no more !
what would your gracious figure ?
alas he 's mad !
do you not come your UNknown son to UNknown that UNknown in time and passion lets go by the important acting of your dread command ?
o say !
but look UNknown on thy mother sits
o step between her and her fighting soul
conceit in weakest bodies strongest works
speak to her hamlet
alas how is 't with you that you do bend your eye on vacancy and with the UNknown air do hold discourse ?
forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep
o gentle son upon the heat and flame of thy UNknown sprinkle cool patience
UNknown do you look ?
on him on him !
look you !
do not look upon me
lest with this UNknown action you convert my stern effects
then what i have to do will want true colour tears perchance for blood
to whom do you speak this ?
do you see nothing there ?
nothing at all yet all there is i see
nor did you nothing hear ?
no nothing but ourselves
look how it steals away !
my father in his habit as he lived !
look where he goes even now out at the portal !
this is the very UNknown of your brain
this UNknown creation ecstasy is very cunning in
it is not madness that i have utter 'd
bring me to the test
i the matter will re word which madness would UNknown from
mother for love of grace
lay not that flattering UNknown to your soul that not your trespass but my madness speaks
it will but skin and film the UNknown place whilst rank corruption mining all within UNknown unseen
confess yourself to heaven repent what 's past avoid what is to come and do not spread the UNknown on the weeds to make them UNknown
o hamlet thou hast UNknown my heart in twain
o throw away the UNknown part of it and live the UNknown with the other half
good night but go not to mine uncle 's bed
assume a virtue if you have it not
refrain tonight and that shall lend a kind of UNknown to the next UNknown
once more good night
i UNknown l blessing beg of you
for this same lord
i will bestow him and will answer well the death i gave him
so again good night
thus bad begins and worse remains behind
one more word good lady
what shall i do ?
not this by no means that i bid you do
let the UNknown king tempt you again to bed pinch wanton on your cheeks call you his mouse
alack i had forgot
but i will UNknown one yard below their mines and blow them at the moon
o 't is most sweet when in one line two UNknown directly meet
this man shall set me packing
i UNknown l lug the guts into the neighbour room
mother good night
come sir to draw toward an end with you
good night mother
you must translate
where is your son ?
ah my good lord what have i seen tonight !
what gertrude ?
in his lawless fit behind the mirror hearing something stir whips out his weapon cries a rat a rat !
and in this UNknown UNknown kills the unseen good old man
o heavy deed !
his liberty is full of threats to all
to you yourself to us to every one
alas how will this bloody deed be answer 'd ?
it will be laid to us whose providence should have kept short restrain 'd and out of haunt this mad young man
but so much was our love we could not understand what was most fit
but like the owner of a foul disease to keep it from UNknown let it feed even on the UNknown of life
where is he gone ?
to draw apart the body he hath kill 'd o UNknown r whom his madness UNknown for what is done
o gertrude come !
and this vile deed we must with all our majesty and skill both countenance and excuse
hamlet in madness hath UNknown slain and from his mother 's closet hath he UNknown 'd him
go seek him out
i pray you make haste
oh gertrude come
UNknown it with dust UNknown 't is kin
tell us where 't is that we may take it thence and bear it to the chapel
do not believe it
besides to be demanded of a sponge !
what UNknown should be made by the son of a king ?
take you me for a sponge my lord ?
ay sir that UNknown up the king 's countenance his rewards his authorities
but such officers do the king best service in the end
he keeps them
first mouthed to be last swallowed when he needs what you have UNknown it is but squeezing you and sponge you shall be dry again
i understand you not my lord
i am glad of it
a UNknown speech sleeps in a foolish ear
my lord you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the king
the body is with the king but the king is not with the body
the king is a thing
a thing my lord !
i have sent to seek him and to find the body
how dangerous is it that this man goes loose !
yet must not we put the strong law on him
he 's loved of the distracted multitude who like not in their judgment but their eyes
and where tis so the offender 's scourge is weigh 'd but never the offence
to bear all smooth and even this sudden sending him away must seem deliberate cause
diseases desperate grown by desperate measure are relieved or not at all
how now ! what hath befall 'n ?
where the dead body is bestow 'd my lord we cannot get from him
but where is he ?
without my lord guarded to know your pleasure
bring him before us
a certain UNknown of UNknown worms are e UNknown n at him
your worm is your only emperor for diet
we fat all creatures else to fat ourselves we fat ourselves for UNknown
alas alas !
what dost you mean by this ?
nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar
where is UNknown ?
but indeed if you find him not within this month you shall nose him as you go upstairs into the lobby
seek him there
hamlet this deed for thine UNknown safety which we do tender as we dearly grieve for that which thou hast done must send thee hence with fiery UNknown
therefore prepare thyself
for england !
i see a UNknown that sees them
come for england !
come for england !
delay it not
for every thing is seal 'd and done that else UNknown on this affair
the present death of hamlet
do it england for like the hectic in my blood he UNknown and thou must cure me
till i know 't is done UNknown UNknown r may hap my joys were ne UNknown r begun
i will not speak with her
she is UNknown indeed distract
her mood will needs be pitied
what would she have ?
she speaks much of her father says she hears there 's tricks i the world speaks things in doubt that carry but half sense
her speech is nothing yet the UNknown use of it doth move the UNknown to collection
UNknown good she was spoken with for she may UNknown dangerous UNknown in ill breeding minds
let her come in
so full of UNknown jealousy is guilt it spills itself in fearing to be spilt
where is the UNknown majesty of denmark ?
how now ophelia !
from another one ?
and his UNknown UNknown
say you ?
he is dead and gone
at his head a grass green turf
at his heels a stone
nay but ophelia
UNknown with sweet flowers
with true love showers
well god 'i ld you !
they say the owl was a baker 's daughter
o lord we know what we are but know not what we may be
god be at your table !
conceit upon her father
but when they ask you what it means say you this
tomorrow is saint valentine 's day
all in the morning UNknown
and i a maid at your window
to be your valentine
and UNknown 'd the chamber door
let in the maid that out a maid never departed more
i UNknown l make an end on 't
by UNknown and by saint charity
alack and fie for shame !
young men will do 't if they come to 't
by cock they are to blame
UNknown she before you UNknown me
you promised me to wed
so would i ha done by yonder sun
an thou UNknown not come to my bed
how long hath she been thus ?
i hope all will be well
we must be patient but i cannot choose but weep to think they should lay him i the cold ground
my brother shall know of it and so i thank you for your good counsel
come my coach !
follow her close
o this is the poison of deep grief
it springs all from her father 's death and now behold
o gertrude gertrude
first her father slain
the people UNknown sick and UNknown in their thoughts and whispers for good UNknown death and we have done but UNknown in UNknown UNknown thus to UNknown him
poor ophelia divided from herself and her fair judgment without the which we are but pictures or mere beasts
where are my UNknown ?
bid them guard the door
save yourself my lord
the rabble call him lord
they cry choose we laertes shall be king
caps hands and tongues applaud it to the clouds
laertes shall be king laertes king !
how cheerfully on the false trail they cry !
o this is counter you false danish dogs !
banglng the doors are broken
o vile king give me my father !
calmly good laertes
what is the cause laertes that thy rebellion looks so giant like ?
let him go gertrude
there is such divinity doth hedge a king that treason can but peep to what it would acts little of his will
tell me laertes why art thou thus UNknown
let him go gertrude
how came he dead ?
i UNknown l not be UNknown with
to hell allegiance !
conscience and grace to the UNknown pit !
i dare damnation
who shall stay you ?
my will not all the world 's
to his good friends thus wide i UNknown l UNknown my arms and like the kind life UNknown pelican UNknown them with my blood
why now you speak like a good child and a true gentleman
that i am UNknown of your dear father 's death and am most sensibly in grief for it
it shall as level to your judgment pierce as day does to your eye
let her come in
o heat dry up my brains !
tears seven times salt burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye !
o rose of may !
dear maid kind sister sweet ophelia !
o heavens !
they bore him UNknown on the UNknown
hey UNknown UNknown UNknown no
and in his grave rain 'd many a tear
fare you well my dove !
UNknown thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge it could not move thus
you must sing a down a down an you call him a down this nothing 's more than matter
there 's rosemary that 's for remembrance
pray love remember
there 's UNknown for you and UNknown
there 's rue for you and here 's some for me
we may call it herb grace o sundays
o you must wear your rue with a difference
there 's a daisy
they say he made a good end
for bonny sweet robin is all my joy
thought and affliction passion hell itself she turns to favour and to UNknown
and will he not come again ?
and will he not come again ?
no no he is dead
go to thy death bed
he never will come again
his beard was as white as snow
all UNknown was his poll
he is gone he is gone
and we cast away moan
god ha mercy on his soul !
and of all christian souls i pray god
god be wi ye
go but apart make choice of whom your wisest friends you will
let this be so
let the great axe fall
go captain from me greet the danish king
tell him that by his licence UNknown UNknown the UNknown of a promised march over his kingdom
i will do so my lord
go safely on
they are of norway sir
how UNknown sir i pray you ?
against some part of poland
who commands them sir ?
the nephew to old norway UNknown
goes it against the main of poland sir or for some frontier ?
truly to speak and with no addition we go to gain a little patch of ground that hath in it no profit but the name
to pay five ducats five i would not farm it
why then the polack never will defend it
yes it is already garrison 'd
two thousand souls and 20 000 ducats will not debate the question of this straw
i humbly thank you sir
god be wi you sir
how all occasions do inform against me and spur my dull revenge
i do not know why yet i live to say this thing 's to do
UNknown i have cause and will and strength and means to do 't
examples gross as earth UNknown me
witness this army of such mass and charge
o from this time forth
my thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth !
laertes was your father dear to you ?
or are you but the painting of a sorrow a face without a heart ?
why ask you this ?
hamlet comes back
to cut his throat i the church
no place indeed should murder UNknown
revenge should know no bounds
but good laertes will you do this stay close within your chamber
hamlet return 'd shall know you are come home
we UNknown l set on those who UNknown l praise your excellence and for your UNknown most especially bring you in fine together and wager on your heads
if this should fail and that our drift look through our bad performance
UNknown better not UNknown 'd
therefore this plot should have a back or second that might hold if this did blast in proof
i UNknown l have prepared him a chalice for the UNknown UNknown but UNknown if by chance he escape your venom 'd stuck our purpose will hold there
how now sweet queen ?
one woe doth tread upon another 's heel so fast they follow
your sister 's drown 'd laertes
drown 'd ?
alas then she is drown 'd ?
i forbid my tears but yet
it is our trick nature her custom holds let shame say what it will
adieu my lord
let 's follow gertrude
now fear i this will give it start again
is she to be buried in christian burial that UNknown seeks her own salvation ?
i tell thee she is
and therefore make her grave straight
well how can that be unless she drowned herself in her own defence ?
why 't is found so
it must be se UNknown it cannot be else
for here lies the point
if i drown myself UNknown it UNknown an act
and an act hath three branches
it is to act to do to perform
UNknown she drowned herself UNknown
nay but hear you goodman UNknown
give me leave
here stands the man good
if the man go to this water and drown himself it is will he UNknown he he goes mark you that
but if the water come to him and drown him he drowns not himself
UNknown he that is not guilty of his own death UNknown not his own life
UNknown thy brains no more about it
go get thee to UNknown
fetch me a UNknown of liquor
in youth when i did love did love
methought it was very sweet
has this fellow no feeling of his business that he sings at grave making ?
custom hath made it in him a property of UNknown
tis e UNknown n so
that skull had a tongue in it and could sing once
how the knave UNknown it to the ground as if it were cain 's jaw bone that did the first murder !
it might be the UNknown of a politician one that would UNknown god might it not ?
it might my lord
here 's fine revolution an we had the trick to see 't
there 's another
where be his UNknown now his UNknown his tricks ?
why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the UNknown with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of his action of battery ?
whose grave 's this UNknown ?
for such a guest is meet
i think it be thine indeed for thou UNknown in 't
thou lie out of it sir and therefore it is not yours
for my part i do not lie in 't and yet it is mine
thou dost lie in 't to be in 't and say it is thine
tis for the dead not for the quick therefore thou UNknown
tis a quick lie sir UNknown away gain from me to you
what man dost thou dig it for ?
for no man sir
one that was a woman sir but rest her soul she 's dead
how absolute the knave is !
how long hast thou been a grave maker ?
of all the days i the year i came to 't that day that our last king hamlet UNknown UNknown
how long is that since ?
cannot you tell that ?
every fool can tell that
it was the very day that young hamlet was born he that is mad and sent into england
ay marry why was he sent into england ?
why because he was mad
he shall recover his wits there or if he do not it 's no great matter there
there the men are as mad as he
how came he mad ?
very strangely they say
upon what ground ?
how long will a man lie i the earth ere he rot ?
why he more than another ?
i UNknown e lain you in the earth three and 20 years
whose was it ?
whose do you think it was ?
nay i know not
he poured a UNknown of UNknown on my head once
this same skull sir was UNknown 's skull the king 's jester
he hath borne me on his back a thousand times and now how UNknown in my imagination it is !
my gorge rises at it
here hung those lips that i have kissed
i know not how oft
where be your UNknown now ?
your UNknown ?
not one now to mock your own grinning
quite chap fallen
let her paint an inch thick to this favour she must come
make her laugh at that
prithee horatio tell me one thing
what 's that my lord ?
dost thou think alexander looked o this fashion i the earth ?
e UNknown n so
UNknown caesar dead and turn 'd to clay
might stop a hole to keep the wind away
UNknown to consider too curiously to consider so
not a jot
and with such UNknown rites this doth UNknown the UNknown they follow did with desperate hand UNknown its own life
twas of some estate
what ceremony else ?
her death was doubtful
must there no more be done ?
no more be done
lay her i the earth
and from her fair and UNknown flesh may violets spring !
i tell thee UNknown priest a UNknown angel shall my sister be when thou UNknown howling
what the fair ophelia !
sweets to the sweet
i thought thy bride bed to have deck 'd sweet maid not have UNknown 'd thy grave
o UNknown woe fall ten times UNknown on that cursed head whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense deprived thee of
hold off the earth awhile
till i have caught her once more in mine arms
whose phrase of sorrow UNknown the wandering stars and makes them stand like wonder wounded UNknown ?
this is i
thou pray 's t not well
i prithee take thy fingers from my throat
for though i am not UNknown and rash yet have i something in me dangerous which let thy UNknown fear
hold off thy hand !
pluck them asunder
why i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer wag
o my son what theme ?
i loved ophelia
what wilt thou do for her ?
o he is mad laertes
for love of god UNknown him
UNknown show me what thou 'i t do
woo 't weep ?
woo 't drink up UNknown ?
eat a crocodile ?
dost thou come here to whine ?
to UNknown me with leaping in her grave ?
be buried quick with her and so will i
and if thou UNknown of mountains let them throw millions of acres on us till our ground UNknown his UNknown against the burning zone make UNknown like a UNknown !
nay an thou 'i t mouth i UNknown l UNknown as well as thou
this is mere madness
anon his silence will sit UNknown
hear you sir
i loved you ever
let hercules himself do what he may the cat will UNknown and dog will have his day
good horatio wait upon him
strengthen your patience in our last night 's speech
we UNknown l put the matter to the present push
good gertrude set some watch over your son
there 's a divinity that shapes our ends rough UNknown them how we will
that is most certain
why man they did make love to this employment they are not near my conscience
why what a king is this !
does it not think 's t thee stand me now upon ?
for by the image of my cause i see the UNknown of his
i UNknown l court his favours
but sure the bravery of his grief did put me into a UNknown passion
peace ! who comes here ?
your lordship is right welcome back to denmark
i humbly thank you sir
dost know this water fly ?
no my lord
tis a UNknown
i will receive it sir with all UNknown of spirit
put your bonnet to his right use 't is for the head
i thank your lordship it is very hot
no believe me 't is very cold
the wind is UNknown
but yet methinks it is very UNknown and hot for my complexion
exceedingly my lord it is very UNknown as 't were i cannot tell how
but my lord his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head
sir this is the matter
i beseech you remember
sir here is newly come to court laertes believe me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent differences of very soft society and great showing
indeed to speak UNknown of him he is the card or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see
the UNknown sir ?
of laertes ?
i would you did sir
yet in faith if you did it would not much approve me
well sir ?
i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself
i mean sir for his weapon
but in the UNknown laid on him by them in his UNknown he 's UNknown
what 's his weapon ?
UNknown and dagger
what call you the carriages ?
the carriages sir are the UNknown
the king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him he shall not exceed you three hits
it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would UNknown the answer
how if i answer no ?
i mean sir the opposition of your person in trial
sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty
tis the breathing time of day with me i will win for him an i can if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits
shall i re deliver you e UNknown n so ?
to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will
i commend my duty to your lordship
he did comply with his mother 's dug before he sucked it
you will lose this wager my lord
i do not think so
since he went into france i have been in UNknown practise
i shall win at the odds
but thou wouldst not think how ill all 's here about my heart
but it is no matter
nay good my lord
i will UNknown their repair hither and say you are not fit
not a whit
if it be now 't is not to come
if it be not to come it will be now
if it be not now yet it will come
the readiness is all
give me your pardon sir
i UNknown e done you wrong
but pardon 't as you are a gentleman
this presence knows and you must needs have heard how i am punish 'd with sore distraction
what i have done that might your nature honour and exception roughly awake i here proclaim was madness
i do embrace it freely
and will this brother 's wager frankly play
give us the UNknown
your skill shall like a star i the darkest night stick fiery off indeed
you mock me sir
cousin hamlet you know the wager ?
very well my lord
i do not think it
i have seen you both
but since he is better 'd we have therefore odds
this is too heavy let me see another
this likes me well enough
these UNknown have all a length ?
ay my good lord
let all the UNknown their ordnance fire
the king shall drink to hamlet 's better breath
and in the cup an union shall he throw richer than that which four UNknown kings in denmark 's crown have worn

as thou 'r t a man give me the UNknown !
o good horatio what a wounded name
things standing thus unknown shall live behind me !
if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
absent thee from felicity awhile and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain to tell my story
good night sweet prince and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
hey slow down !
thank you for coming tonight darwin
this room is secure so we can speak freely
why the secrecy ?
shut us down ?
our target is leonard saber
as you know he is a former arms dealer and current UNknown of UNknown industries
the bureau 's intel shows saber has developed a new UNknown with possible military applications
they suspect he has sold his technology to the far east under the code name UNknown
now darwin we need to find out how saber plans to use this technology
your mission is to UNknown the UNknown files from saber 's personal computer located in his library right here
ben we 'r e gonna get you that evidence
we UNknown l prove once and for all what we can do
we UNknown l give UNknown m no choice
they UNknown l have to keep the program and make us special agents
look i believe in you but ifwe fail we blow a case they UNknown e been trying to crack for two years
hey i 'm nine inches tall
i only see the upside
right this way sir
UNknown do you copy ?
he 's wearing a 6 000 suit 50 000 watch and according to my UNknown scope UNknown size 36 UNknown UNknown
saber 's about to start his speech
remember the clock is ticking dude
blaster UNknown what 's your twenty ?
of course i am
time to get this party started
talk to me do we have any activity ?
UNknown is secure
darwin you 'r e behind schedule
you all right ?
do you want to UNknown ?
no no it 's ok
i UNknown e been trained to do this
i 'd follow you into a snarling pack of UNknown !
what are you looking at ?
move along pal
darwin do you copy ?
yeah you 'r e right
i 'm in the morgue
don 't you wish your blowtorch was hot like mine
good thing i took shop
welcome to my home
get back on mission
a secret which is at the core of any successful family communication
that 's cold
you are clear to UNknown saber 's study
ok i 'm in
and nothing will be the same
why did they put the q so far away from the o ?
ok i 'm in
you and me i mean you know
copy that UNknown
ok UNknown i think i found it
thank you and good night
saber wrapped his speech
UNknown i 'm going upstairs for a drink
darwin saber 's heading up
about 50 seconds
UNknown are you seeing this ?
i see it
it 's about global UNknown
i 'm UNknown now
execute delay strategy b
i 'm a mole
switching to wireless UNknown
i can 't
come on baby come on
if he doesn 't make it are you free thursday night ?
he UNknown l make it
ok drop the line
stop drop and roll !
we got it
oh no !
i 'm going after the dog !
wait blaster !
UNknown blaster 's gonna need backup
hey UNknown !
let 's go old buddy
we 'r e out of here
let 's go
blaster UNknown UNknown
we should celebrate over dinner
hang on UNknown
yo UNknown did you catch the little leg twitch at the end of my death ?
that was acting baby
ok you can laugh now but some of those people back there were crying
it was like the end of old yeller
the game 's over for saber
it 's all there
i knew you could do this
this is great
like you know green UNknown or navy seals
does this make me look fatter ?
how much longer UNknown ?
just a few more touches to UNknown saber 's UNknown system
to access the information on darwin 's UNknown
i have to factor a UNknown UNknown over a UNknown field
i haven 't worn a jacket since the prom
you look very sharp
what does that mean ?
men are like government bonds
they take way too long to mature
but if you 'r e a woman trying to make it in a man 's world you have to learn to think like they do and keep them guessing
i 'm not interested
don 't you get it ?
i want him interested in me
and he UNknown l only be interested if he thinks i 'm not
but you are interested ?
ok everybody they 'r e here
g force in your positions
it 's UNknown
that 's neat
time is money
now our work UNknown on developing communication between humans and animals
now these cockroaches right here have been trained to carry UNknown into surveillance UNknown which is i think really kind of neat
this is a UNknown
so you UNknown l notice the extremely developed sense of motor skills
that 's because their brains have close to a billion UNknown and a UNknown UNknown
that 's a thousand times stronger than any UNknown
it gives them exceptional like eye hand reflexes
it 's a video game
ok we UNknown l go over here
you 'r e really gonna be amazed by this
it 's a language UNknown
it UNknown animals to talk to humans
without it they sound like normal animals
go ahead take a look
you 'r e doctor UNknown
you talk to animals
getting them to talk back that 's the hard part
yeah just like we 'r e gonna be
hey how you doing ?
that 's impossible
think that 's something ?
check out UNknown
who 's UNknown ?
his family was UNknown
you ran a mission without my authorization ?
wait a second you broke into leonard saber 's house ?
we accomplished in one night what you guys couldn 't do in two years
and without a warrant
all right then show me
what 'd you get ?
UNknown you 'r e on
darwin 's UNknown contains classified
just open it
right computer wrong file
well this is all we have
i 'm sorry
it 's about global UNknown
i saw it
i 'm shutting you down
you can 't do this
yeah i can
this means we 'r e in big trouble now
c UNknown ya !
thanks to you those UNknown can speak
but sadly that means they 'r e now capable of exposing the derelict activities committed on my watch
yeah but i
i 'm not going down in washington as the crazy gopher guy
dr kendall 's coming with me
cage anything that moves
here 's an idea
we UNknown e got to get out of here
the document capsules
lock and load
let 's go
and you tell him this isn 't over
hey hey !
put it down
light bends around them
now let me see now
why are you letting them out ?
i don 't see anything
on the floor
what was that ?
be cool if there were though
UNknown what 's the situation ?
i UNknown l need to inspect your goods
let 's go
yes i know
go go go !
this facility 's closed
i don 't do cages !
UNknown let go !
what do you think ?
is this the frying pan or the fire ?
let 's all agree right now
none of this goes on our r sum
this is UNknown
if those animals bolted then i got a problem
i want them all back dead or alive zero exposure
three guinea pigs and a mole
got it ?
don 't they have a gym around here ?
a UNknown juice or something ?
lay off the nuggets man
all right my UNknown little friends
welcome to your new home
good luck getting out
i thought it might cheer us up
you can 't just UNknown it out anytime
it ruins the effect
we got to get out of here
then what ?
they UNknown l never take us seriously
well we did get the wrong file
no i downloaded the right file and we 'r e gonna prove it as soon as we find a way out of here
well let 's ask that guy
he looks cute and friendly
excuse me my UNknown little friend
may i ask you a question ?
don 't move !
that 's all i 'm saying
is he talking to us ?
did someone order a knuckle sandwich ?
because i 'm about to make a delivery
buddy ? no
and if you want to stay alive do not cross that line !
take cover !
don 't pay any attention to him
he 's a quarter ferret
i have no ferret in me hurley
that has never been proven
then why are you marked down ?
i 'm on sale !
everyone goes on sale eventually
this should come as no surprise but he grew up in the UNknown ward at UNknown
mice are on sale
we agreed this was my zone
we all agreed that right ?
you guys are all idiots right ?
not a ferret !
where is the bathroom ?
well for me this morning the sports page which is pretty much where you 'r e standing
we don 't have time for this
locate escape options
i wouldn 't do that if i were you
this might be a good time for a nap
they simply dated
now stop looking at the line !
darwin please let me pull his tongue out
you try to pull my tongue out you UNknown l see what happens
let 's check that lock
g force delta formation
the circus !
we 'r e specially bred UNknown altered
and highly trained secret agents
known as g force !
i get it
darwin it 's locked
UNknown launch is in 29 hours
are you ok ?
well i told them we shouldn 't be shut down
and then i got to the bit where i talk to guinea pigs
and then that 's where i lost UNknown m
darwin told me before he left that he was positive he downloaded the right file
where is the UNknown ?
it 's still back at the warehouse
well we gotta go get it
security 's probably crawling all over the place
that 's all right
ok what do we do about the g force ?
they 'r e highly professional
they 'r e probably halfway back to my house
it 's pretty simple
except that well they never pick me
now go act cute
how cute is that ?
come on UNknown
grandpa what is that ?
that 's a hideous crime against nature i 'd say
i 'm outta here
i want a UNknown
finally the recognition i deserve
watch the hands buddy
that little girl has no idea what she 's in for !
i 'm gonna put nail polish and lipstick on her and a dress
a dress ?
what about that little fur ball there ?
he looks like he 's full of life
i 'm not fat
he 's a little plump as it is
that 's probably a good thing
oh mama !
i UNknown l show you
hey guys i can see my future !
it 's all cakes and cuddles !
i think he 's gonna throw him in with the snake
i would UNknown e hit you so hard you would have shed yourself
then i would have turned you into a nice pair of UNknown boots
that kid 's a monster
he just lifted him up and
come on kid
poop in his hand
oh no no not upside down not upside down
hold him like this
i don 't know
there you are
i can see it in your eyes
at UNknown local time
he left a message saying the launch was on track for project UNknown
since then nothing
sir with respect if you were to authorize a search warrant
on what grounds ?
saber comes from the defence supply industry
he knows how to cover his tracks
where is blaster ?
i think you need lipstick too
don 't you look pretty ?
oh my gosh
let me do this UNknown
i UNknown l come back and get you
once i 'm in the ground i can tunnel to freedom and rescue you
you get it out of here before it starts to smell up my shop
that 's not the plan
no no no
oh no !
she was way cuter than the other one
he 's got the UNknown
what the hell was that ? !
ok i got him
i got him
what 's that on your butt ?
it 's a birthmark
i have seen that birthmark
look at this
don 't point that thing at me
it might go off
you see ?
ben spent years training us
we do things that people only dream of doing
so you UNknown l do tricks for them
but you my friend are a common everyday pet shop guinea pig just like me
we must have been separated at birth
but fate has brought us back together my brother
don 't say that
i have a brother !
come here brother
i 'm good with that
i am not your brother
i sit here every day hoping to get adopted to find family
and now because of you family has found me
hurley there is no way that we are related so just get that through your head ok ?
can you open this ?
i don 't know
ok just UNknown the computer
no no no !
don 't cross the line
a UNknown nut perhaps ?
so this is why i never saw you eat
not once in all these years
all these treats and you never shared ?
you think i wanted to spend my nights sneaking out to feed myself ?
starving by day and praying for night to come so i could take a bite without the threat of you eating everything i have ?
you drove me to this !
my friend UNknown got crushed in a garbage truck and you said nothing about this
i 'm outta here
i am going
you got a job to do
you can 't jeopardize it for me
i wasn 't going to
you 'r e only saying that so i won 't have to feel the pain so bad when you leave
keep believing that
i got to go
you got to go
let go of me
you 'r e gonna find the family you 'r e looking for someday
the cage is mine !
and it 's all true
my grandfather was a ferret !
now who 's been marked down ?
so there 's the north star which means ben 's is east
ok i need to head that way
go back hurley
you think you 'r e the only one who can survive in the big bad world ?
well the truth is hurley is out of his cage and it 's time to hit the town !
guinea pigs gone wild !

one more word and i UNknown l turn you into a small side of bacon
well you are sizzling hot !
don 't need that or that or that !
although maybe this can stay
UNknown you are fine china !
what exactly are we doing anyway ?
two days ago my team UNknown on a mission
today i 'm gonna finish it
my brother 's a loon !
i love him but he 's
i UNknown e heard of places like this !
they sell something called layer cake !
it 's UNknown one cake it 's many in layers !
often up to six !
it is the holy UNknown of human food !
i can 't believe you 'r e getting so excited about cake
hurley i got to check out that UNknown
i hope you 'r e keeping track of all these parts
don 't watch me
just act natural
hurley do you know what this is ?
yeah i 'm pretty sure it 's called UNknown
this is a military grade multiple array UNknown developed for the military 's UNknown weapons program
sorry i tuned out there
what were you saying ?
i gotta get this chip back to ben 's
ok that 's weird
come on move it !
why are we stopping ?
we 'r e gonna fight it
we 'r e gonna do what ?
we have to get that chip
good luck with that !
suck in your gut !
i am !
watch out bro !
don 't think the UNknown is gonna cover that
ok thanks hurley !
what is this thing ?
this is UNknown
we have to get this back to ben 's
how are we gonna do that ?
hey bro ?
i could get used to all this secret agent stuff if you 'r e ever looking for a new recruit
hurley just be quiet and lean right
look who i found out back
hey guys !
what do you mean he didn 't make it ?
he was gonna break out and engineer our escape but then the mission went bad
he got crushed in a garbage truck
this is all my fault
ben there 's nothing you could UNknown e done
no i could UNknown e told you the truth UNknown you really are
darwin i misled you
any of you
no engineering ?
i wanted you guys to think of yourselves as more than just balls of fur waiting for your next pellet
well maybe you can explain that to UNknown
ben we need to know
tell us who we are
ok you guys want to know ?
UNknown we rescued you at a roadside UNknown stand in the UNknown
i guess there you 'r e some kind of you know delicacy
blaster we found you at a UNknown company
they were testing you know some kind of hair UNknown for allergic reactions
and UNknown we found you know right before his home was dug out to build a golf course
and darwin i
your parents abandoned you because you were the runt of the litter
i was a runt ?
what do you mean ?
i never even had a chance
this is carter
dispatch just got a report of two giant UNknown riding a UNknown on pacific
let 's finish this
i am just an average everyday pet store guinea pig
since when did you start listening to me ?
my parents didn 't even want me
look darwin you saved us from the dogs you defeated the UNknown read the stars like a map and got us here
i couldn 't have done any of that
do you have any idea how many guinea pigs could UNknown e done all those things ?
i mean literally like three
and they 'r e all in this room
yeah you 'r e right
i may not be UNknown engineered but i 'm no house pet either
hey team come over here
he wanted us to believe in ourselves
and we did believe
blaster you 'r e a graduate of west point
yeah correspondence course
two hundred thousand
we may be guinea pigs but we 'r e not ordinary
we 'r e special
ben we don 't have much time
that UNknown 's no UNknown
when i tried to disconnect this chip it came alive and it attacked us
it was so UNknown !
if i hadn 't been there to take cover fire for darwin who knows
the UNknown UNknown caused it to transform
ben UNknown and UNknown are the same thing
and if every saber product in the world has that chip that means that every UNknown on earth is gonna be a killing machine
i tried to access the UNknown file on your UNknown but saber he protected it with some nasty virus
i mean i 'm a little bit at a loss
sorry to interrupt
i UNknown l go back in the box
oh UNknown !
wait a second
well that 's not entirely true
this is a little UNknown i UNknown e been working on called the rapid UNknown vehicle
she UNknown l do 65 with the throttle wide open
and blaster it has a rocking UNknown
that 's what 's up !
pimp my ride !
and we know our mission
UNknown saber 's mansion locate the main network core and dock this infected UNknown
bring down big mama with baby disease
i don 't know what that means
but yeah that 's good
here are the keys
open the door !
you too hurley
UNknown plot us a course to saber 's
i 'm on it
mooch we need eyes in the sky
call for backup
my stomach doesn 't do well with action adventure
hurley don 't you dare
that 's real professional guys
mooch where 's that UNknown ?
ok here come the bad guys
better have their a game
may i ask why we 'r e chasing UNknown ?
no you may not
we got three party UNknown on our tail
hurry up !
they 'r e boxing us in !
yeah i got UNknown m i got UNknown m
maybe they want to adopt us !
not likely hurley
unlock it and rock it
see ya !
where 'd he go ?
how low can you go ?
there he goes !
bye bye UNknown !
you might want to buckle up
he paid for UNknown
hey what 's that ?
this is my little friend
did we win ?
they 'r e rolling around in little plastic balls
this one 's not getting away from me !
darwin i need some help here
mooch i need a visual on UNknown
i can 't get these guys off my tail
we don 't have tails
hang on UNknown
blaster hard right

i 'm gonna flatten this little varmint !
mess with the bull you get the horns
look out !
that was great !
face it UNknown
guys i 'm going in
hurley suck in your gut
blaster i need to tell you something about UNknown
you have nothing to worry about
she 's not interested in me
she told you that ?
yeah well maybe she told you she wants me in order to look not interested in you which makes you more interested in her
are we ready to change the world ?
go go go go !
it 's very important that you stand guard
whatever you do don 't leave this spot
we 'r e counting on you
there 's the network core
behind the glass
ok follow me
don 't touch it or this place UNknown l blow
tick tick boom
as i press this button we move forward to a brave new world order owned and operated by UNknown
we 'r e too late
we can still stop it ifwe UNknown the virus into saber 's computer
let 's go
oh come to papa !
it 's all saber sir
is this enough probable cause ?
UNknown report common household UNknown
coming to life and chasing people
those are UNknown UNknown !
but they 'r e just supposed to communicate with each other
bravo echo !
it 's heading for the UNknown
it 's got hurley !
oh hey guys !
cook me ?
move it blaster !
we got to save him !
get me out !
blaster UNknown that thing !
i 'm on it !
don 't let it hit the UNknown !
i want to go home !
why is this happening ?
this wasn 't the plan !
saber what 's going on ?
get us out of here !
take saber down to the command truck !
i 'm not a chicken
didn 't drop the cake
hurley let 's go !
hunk UNknown !
run for cover !
i 'm all right
not without us
hurley i told you stay put and guard the UNknown
didn 't i tell you that ?
i thought i could depend on you
good luck darwin
ok this is good
you have to believe me
i don 't know what 's going on
i only wanted to be the biggest UNknown manufacturer in the world
what do you want ?
i got major problems here
there 's your problem
g force went in to shut it down
g force ?
sir i 'm picking up a video feed
it 's one of ours
let 's see it
that 's darwin
what 's he gonna do UNknown his way out of there ?
he 's gonna insert a virus into the core and take down the network
you UNknown the bad guy 's lair
where is he ?
well i hid in a soup can
rode it all the way to the city dump
and it was stinky
actually you may call me mr UNknown
you tricked saber into helping you build UNknown ?
how could you do this to us ?
i thought we were friends
i put my life on the line for you
UNknown was in my basement this whole time ?
and he wasn 't a man
he was a mole
UNknown was just a cover
i created an army of UNknown UNknown and they created an array of giant UNknown UNknown
UNknown capable of pulling down all the space junk UNknown the planet and driving every human underground
so what do you think ?
you UNknown e betrayed us
three million UNknown
the humans came and destroyed our home destroyed our home
son if you ever get the chance to bring mankind to its knees do it
they showed us no mercy darwin
well now it 's my turn to do a little pest control
if you UNknown l excuse me it 's UNknown
going up !
i think i UNknown l stay here and guard the UNknown
what 's our plan ?
stop UNknown and save the world
that 's more of a goal than a plan
it 's working !
no place like home
that UNknown l leave a mark
come on !
how big is this thing going to get ?
you humans stole my home !
now i will steal yours
look out !
i have no quarrel with you darwin but mankind must pay
you know i can 't let you do that
then you leave me no choice my friend
i gotta get you back up there
no hurley !
it 's the only way !
coming hurley !
everybody hold on !
well that 's kind of the point here
i lost my family
we 'r e your family
me and blaster and UNknown and ben and UNknown
UNknown ben took us in when nobody else wanted us
and he made us a family
we 'r e a family
oh no !
what have i done ?
it 's too late darwin !
i can 't stop it !
but we can
UNknown come with me
hold it right there
he was my man
i don 't know what they call it back in the pet shop but out here we well we call it being a hero
all you ever wanted was a family
i never got to tell you this but
i 'd be proud proud to call you my brother
you bet i did
this is great !
oh come here
oh this is great !
not to worry
ok but i 'm telling you now i don 't do well with UNknown
easy there tiger
which one of us are you interested in ?
no no blaster !
thirty 42 83
hey guys ?
and he 's getting help from somebody quite UNknown about the UNknown
three down 178 000 to go

your friend agent UNknown has been UNknown

get him on the good foot !
all right hurley !

good thing i took shop
finally the recognition i deserve
i 'm jeff gordon !

this time we 'r e in north wales splitting slate exploring castles and steaming up mountains
thanks for joining us
from UNknown mount UNknown to UNknown castles to sweeping victorian UNknown it 's a poem written in landscape
i think this area has as much site seeing UNknown and interest as any place in britain
we UNknown l mountain climb on a steam train
learn some welsh follow a miner deep into a slate mine shepherd sheep get passionate about castles and UNknown ourselves in britain 's top UNknown wonders
the british isles UNknown of england and three UNknown lands
our target this time is north wales where we UNknown l visit a beach resort two castle towns a slate mine and a national park with wales UNknown peak

the traditional pagan worship in the city now UNknown with the jews and an UNknown religion up to now banned christianity
library of alexandria 391 a d
after taking the library many UNknown were converted
UNknown continued teaching and UNknown while his former students held important positions in the social elite
the empire was split in two forever
many christians saw this as a sign of the end of the world and decided to prepare by practicing a more holy life
the order of UNknown monks was charged to go through the streets and watch for christian morality now uneven by the presence of the jews
how many fools have wondered why not the stars fall from the sky
here bodies do fall

christians have met in the UNknown
they mocking the gods
he may not fear him
but fear our swords !
are you going to attack them ?
are you going to staying your hands with blood for an insult ?
the gods !
if you feel so bad report them to the prefect
it might seem that you protecting them i try to protect our disciples
you who are inciting them to be murderers
UNknown as director you have the last word
the insult must to be answered
the jews can do what they want is not your battle
ask to your christians you would do well join us with your rank
you will not caused my disciples out of this house !
glory to serapis !
wait for my command !
no one should suspect until we have surrounded
do you hear her complain ?
their mouths do not speak their eyes do not see his nose does not smell

UNknown is my brothers i will go as prisoner with them
if necessary so do that
if anyone anyone dares laying finger on one of my brothers

how could i UNknown e been so wrong ?
see you here locked because my fault y
i am free
where are they ?
which one ?
what do you think lady ?
you are so bold
but i do not know i have simple minded
no should be simple
what if there were simple explanation about the wanders
what theory is that ?
the behavior of the wandering is only an optical illusion produced by our movement in combination with his around the sun
his work was lost in the fire that destroyed mother 's library
that 's way we have to take great care of this place
is all that remains the wisdom of men
and the wind always blow against us
and the birds would be wipe on
i told you the hypothesis of UNknown that no sense at all
i feel that what you said be UNknown
but right now i do not know how
make way for the prefect !
make way !
make way !
let me UNknown be forgiven and released
in exchange for my generosity the UNknown leave the UNknown and the library immediately and make use of facilities whatever you like
what can we expect ?
we destroy everything !
obey immediately !
we will send the rest later
on the cross !
what are the minor works ? take only important !
the soldiers retreated !
just get out here and help !
we can not with so many !
we need for help
are they crazy ?
come on !
we gotta go !
if you want to die by our gods let him
UNknown do not
UNknown my dear friend calm down
let bishop cyril begun his own depend
prefect our blessed UNknown
and stones !
on the sabbath you should honor god in your UNknown instead stopping yourself set in theater
therefore i UNknown stones
we are brothers !
jesus was a jew !
jesus was jewish !
he just wants to scare the jews but why you say then before
what if really interesting you and not them ?
yes but forget that many of your friends that circle are not
a full sail prefect
and now lady
when UNknown drop the sack the boat will be moving forward
therefore the sack not fall at the foot of the mast but will fall further back
yes but this is definitely proved
has behaved as if the boat stationary
but it works
a few years ago you was not so UNknown prefect
a few years ago i spoke first before thinking
my father would have celebrated something like a good wine
the stars will not fall
do not you know that the universe is a huge chest don 't you ?
they laid on top and the earth ground
in this idiot not been told that the earth is round !
the earth is flat
read the scriptures !
why not the people that live in the bottom fall out ?
what about the one sides ?
why not slip ?
does the earth is flat or round ?
only god knows these things
leave them in the ground !
where they are belong !
lady do not despair
why do the wandering very that UNknown so unexpected ?
and what is worse
why is change size summer to winter ?
perhaps it 's because and sometimes farther ?
but UNknown watch
with us the earth traveling in a circle around him
therefore and this is the key
we are always exactly same distance
if as you say accept that changes the distance that forces us to add UNknown into orbit earth
it is a fire
where 's the fire ?
now i say to you
grave no longer for our dead brothers weep not
said you killed for the others but they are UNknown
i do not know because in this day who repeated the scriptures without understanding at all
it is they who saw only a man when the son of god standing on the front of us
and it is they who
damn and UNknown !
now whole the jews want revenge !
i 'm afraid you do not understand what is really happening
lady you know risk to coming here
where are the troops ?
why do not more soldiers on the streets ?
no army can contain entire city

you 'r e disgusting !
i was distinction !
i was i 'm not anymore
i return to you UNknown !
and you have faith
very simply very humbly i ask forgiveness
it will be hard but i know that one day you will forgive me
i know it !
spare me your tears i 'm embarrassed !
i knew him in 6th class he was a charming child
i 'm sorry
so the same school
his family lived in misery
the father was a mason but unemployed 9 months of the year
hardship we can barely imagine
no water no gas
they rarely had meat
in our UNknown and our twenties i don 't deny it i was under his spell !
how he disappointed me
they 'r e sleeping
one day he decided he 'd smoke no more
so he never smoked again
subsequently someone asked if it had been tough he replied
answered you know with pride !
boys your father has never been what one would call an attentive father
often and until very recently he 's UNknown abandoned your mother and you
well those days are over !
tonight your father declares to you that you UNknown l have a father who will be here who will never be absent again !
a father who will be a father
i have not declared this to you out of vanity
i UNknown e declared this largely because i love you with all my heart
mama and both of you
that 's all
i 'm obliged to
you know it 's hard to follow you ?
i hope so !
that 's for sure
the greatest is UNknown
there 's genius in that man and i love him
i love him profoundly
i UNknown e seen him
esther you asked me to go and see your sister 's husband
i UNknown e seen him
everything you asked i UNknown e done
i UNknown l go no further !
today im telling you it stops immediately
in your mind what does he represent ?
a symbol ?
is it important for you to imitate UNknown ?
no i don 't have that desire i have no sense of UNknown
see what i did there ?
UNknown UNknown me
i am not aiming for UNknown
i 'm much more of an inspector marlowe
a question of
daft question !
i 'm inquiring about a murder !
esther you asked me to go and see your brother in law
i UNknown e seen him
you asked me to go and see your sister 's husband
he clearly is a UNknown being
a pathological liar it 's quite obvious
violent without hesitation but not a composed violence UNknown i 'd say
i UNknown l spare you the professional UNknown the post UNknown nonsense
he is everything you say but not a killer
not at all
your sister 's killer is a complete madman
but his illness has a name
he 's called mu oz
who is he ?
i tell you he 's dead mu oz !
he 's dead !
what are you looking for ?
so it 's regrettable
excuse me !
there they are your keys
me i think not
and you want to stop ?
and your sister ?
my sister is completely against the idea that intellectuals have no balls !
i may have no balls but i have children !
i UNknown l ask them !
at my age and in my position these things happen
eh miss UNknown UNknown ?
yes it happens !
i love you
a young man a very courteous boy very much requires me
professor do me the service of UNknown this committee
do me the honour i agreed
but i can still say no
sir i think not
we don 't sweat with decency miss UNknown UNknown !
you don 't know everything !
we 'r e bathing in the irrational !
i promised to go out less now that 's translated to no longer go out at all !
so what can i do ?
excellency my wife doesn 't want me to ! is that it ?
it 's not possible !
yes what ?
minister of culture dispute with her illustrious husband
UNknown the minister
UNknown UNknown mr president
your first name is jocelyn is it not ?
yeah put something specific that will make me smile
i 'd like that
i had a rifle through my library unfortunately i only have the UNknown here
you know i have all your work but at my place in the countryside
in la UNknown ?
didn 't you hear ?
UNknown over in UNknown
too much professor too much !
in the UNknown you wrote
i have no imagination
imagination the less you have the better you UNknown l feel
i 'm not talking about books i 'm talking about in life
so in that way my niece esther has gone mad ?
let 's not exaggerate
well so it seems !
to get you to come and see me she must have had to pester you
but you shouldn 't get too attached to her sort !
as you know i have two
the older one the lawyer nothing to say
she works for me
in my farming days she 's what we called a UNknown mare
there 's always one
i don 't tolerate them
hello shoot that horse
but there are people who are the same as animals
what is that esther is saying ?
for example that her brother in law killed her sister
i ask you !
i UNknown l answer with the truth
gen UNknown is not dead
i can tell you !
i loved the missing girl
but she was fragile to the core
a guy that passed by an UNknown she was taken by those things
goodbye family goodbye all
and the husband you UNknown e seen him ?
good for nothing !
i 'm not interested
one thing that upset our poor esther
her sister disappeared in london
i happened to be there on business
she disappeared in london the same day as he was found hanging from a bridge there
that italian swindler what 's his name ?
i must say that these days big international business is hard !
it 's like the middle ages
it 's barbaric !
i see that you replaced your windows
gentlemen i will not detain you
one two three bags four five six seven a little piece of dior !
and now for the UNknown UNknown de resistance
yes yes you 'r e tired
we 'r e going to go now
sleep my dear
etienne i UNknown l give her a kiss from you too ?
one from me too
if you say it to yourself i must be able to say it to myself !
the blood flows
the middle ages barbaric can 't get it out of my head
through our teenage years
you were UNknown in those days
you had the UNknown haircut
you also a big nose
i never had a big nose !
why were we talking about UNknown ?
i don 't know
this idea of a fragile little detective in the big hostile city
but i would go further
it 's a helpless cop
helpless thus thus UNknown UNknown
doctor UNknown ?
tell me was it an emergency ?
you were on call ?
a growth on the UNknown
they lack the mental UNknown
they don 't make a fuss
we can 't imagine
about blood we went to see your uncle
result they beat up our friend 's girlfriend two hours later
not even two hours
we thought we were doing good !
you shouldn 't have !
we believed excuse us that you wanted us to look into it a bit
not at all
thank you anyway !
maybe you think it was for pleasure that we visited the hunchback ?
if that 's it you know we can move on to something else !
you there stir yourself
out you go
where is our taxi ?
hold mr UNknown
how amusing your friend is
so you two kept me from sleeping
i was thinking about my niece UNknown UNknown all night long
you have me reflecting your anxiety
please no misunderstandings !
the other the missing one i 'm indifferent about her
missing or murdered it 's not my problem and i 'm not involved !
understood say no more
a name came back to me
the name UNknown
won 't find him won 't be looking for him
of course of course
he was her sweetheart for a long time
she told him everything
i surely won 't go to geneva
as you wish professor
are you going to geneva ?
surely not !
we have just landed in geneva
the ground temperature is 14 degrees UNknown
it 's raining
what 's with her !
she said she 's upset
yeah yeah yeah
we 'r e nearly there
stay cool my dear stay cool
madam your bag please
we do not claim a universal fame but i hope for you
i repeat for you
you know not really
a little yes
ah ok !
that 's not possible
i UNknown l just send you for a UNknown
and then if that 's negative you can quietly go about your business
what 's happening ?
honestly i UNknown e never seen her
i 'm thinking but it UNknown nothing
did you say mr UNknown ?
i 'm afraid not
my son paul mr UNknown junior
where would we find him ?
you won 't find him
he was the king of rock climbing and then he came loose up in the UNknown
but his employees a secretary remain
names and addresses please ?
go see his widow
the hunchback !
what 's going on ?
what right have you ?
what 's this ?
i don 't know !
and UNknown ?
he made a small
ireland norway west germany UNknown italy spain back in italy
all accidents !
so say interpol
one you introduced drugs to our territory
what did you do ?
you knew this young UNknown ?
not at all
please there are words you shouldn 't use !
UNknown suspect relationships real motives for the trip
you UNknown you put them on ice
you know i was never very ill
even at the clinic ?
even at the clinic
it 's going well ?
yes i think so
but that 's standard
yes of course
a drink at my place ?
another time yes
nor you sidekick for that matter
ah that 's better !
especially for him i feared for him
when will we be released ?
maybe later in the day but don 't count your chickens yet !
another good thing the suspect from the airport the injured woman the drugs she was carrying were not real drugs
it was an unknown substance
weep no more i bring you a snack
i don 't cry !
and you can have wine but that decision costs six cents
is it true that all your windows were smashed ?
no we know who it was
who ? d h of course !
yes the windows it 's funny but i feel d UNknown could pose you big problems
he 's saying incredible things about the death of someone called mu oz
you know what
what are you thinking ?
thanks to you !
being looked down the nose at by 148 paranoid passengers !
thanks dear thanks switzerland !
i didn 't tell you to go !
this amuses her !
that was just the summary !
i UNknown e already been told
by who ?
still i didn 't tell her !
woke me up at UNknown with her UNknown
but it wasn 't a bother !
she 's right she had to lie too
she thought we were in brussels
don 't do that !
it 's only you
how many ?
two each that 's good
expecting someone ?
do we scare you ?
come raoul come
mu UNknown she live
do i have to go by the street ?
muriel 's not here
you 'r e getting ideas if the employer ordered it they 'd have already killed you
no they enjoy it
what have you done for jocelyn ?
i meant the killers i haven 't said that it was jocelyn !
no you didn 't say it
i quit for x reasons but i was very correct fair and all !
to who ?
we never said it was down to him
so someone else must have told him
or mentioned it
that 's what i think
mu oz was it you ?
what do you want from me ?
admit that it was you it stays here between us
he died december 13th you were in madrid from the 8th
feel free to check i never set foot there
you were there !
my dear can you feel his artery to the right ?
my li 'i guy
she 's crazy
she may cut you
mu oz knew it was you and not UNknown ?
you have ten seconds
i can 't
i can 't say yes
i must never
so do otherwise
i UNknown l know that means UNknown es !
i UNknown l spare your modesty that 's all
go on UNknown ten seconds
the others ?
you UNknown e got nothing
you UNknown e no human decency
i cried as much as you over UNknown UNknown
maybe more !
there are limits !
that 's sacred
i have no human decency
this is not the time
leave me alone !
my heart bleeds too
let 's walk
the media have spoken a lot of it
but that boy that spirit !
very brilliant !
i won 't name him
i guess you were informed of their difficulties with the swiss ?
let 's walk
well ma 'a m she is the cause of our UNknown
this kid she 's made your husband take leave of his senses
and it 's more serious there is a mutual fascination
it 's that dramatic !
not to UNknown you but she 's been locked up twice
how much has she involved him ?
is there still time ?
now ma 'a m it 's your turn
alert the faculty
otherwise keep away from him !
he is already condemned
and especially for your little boys
i 'm telling you i UNknown e been thrown out of my place
i have no wife i have no children
i 'm 53 years old
yes that 's really tough
i 'm 53 years old and i 'm on the street
yes that 's
i UNknown e come live with you
a tramp has come to live with you !
i 'm your brother !
not at all on the contrary
i UNknown l call reception they probably have another room
two bedrooms that would be better don 't you think ?
as you wish
crushed you like that eh ?
what i want right now is a shower
may i ?
who knows !
i understand !
you are quite right !
i don 't know
turn on the light can 't see a thing
veal with UNknown
the only place you get UNknown in macao
take a trip coco !
you know how i see our relationship ?
i see myself as the latest pretty little housewife in the neighbourhood and you as the awful UNknown neighbour who 's trying to turn my head
it 's like that yes
you UNknown l have to try hard
give it a go !
is my virtue supposed to fall immediately or do i struggle a bit ?
ah my old man that 's up to you
it 's about your uncle
he 's in my sights
in believing himself very clever he may well sign his death warrant
how so ?
you know left weekly ?
know how many readers ?
two hundred and fifty thousand !
we have a weapon but the truth it will hurt !
they have reserved two pages
we see them tomorrow at UNknown
no do it without me
excuse me someone 's waiting for me
all monsters !
i think of just one thing
geneva your wife all that
it wasn 't very perilous
why does the hunchback persist like that ?
perhaps for fun
haven 't you ever seen a kid torturing flies ?
but why us ?
jean paul where were we exactly ?
plus 4 my father my mother my uncle l UNknown my aunt marie
7 is already plenty
how did you get this ?
i got it that 's all
that makes 11 ?
what 's that dear etienne ?
at a close shave you 'd have had 14 !
dear etienne !
show it to mr UNknown please
what goes there ?
c 'm on !
i agree with you nobody cares !
the UNknown that 's me
don 't insist you UNknown l laugh !
because a UNknown for profit as you say is still very vague
not vague at all
i have custody of UNknown documents
the UNknown is by me
is he the only 1 ?
i needed it as a UNknown
only i didn 't realise it 's influence
they UNknown l back it all up !
especially today !
it 's a pleasure to suffer for her
tell me dear last evening you didn 't want to come here right ?
if it had UNknown you 'd be dead and that would be awful so i UNknown e no choice i must use my proof
she is very UNknown !
oh it hurts !
do you work for the UNknown lodge or for the vatican ?
i am profoundly religious
i didn 't say that
sir did not say UNknown
a hazardous UNknown
i admit however that if miss UNknown the UNknown lodge from the UNknown that would also be hazardous
sir must live
if i understand correctly he s advising you to make me disappear too ?
but you never really bothered me
i never imagined you could bore me so much
gen UNknown bothered you a lot ?
yes she was just too bright
so he had to killer her ?
she had to be crushed dear
but she didn 't suffer
it 's too late anyway
know where i UNknown e come from ?
yes i ve just been informed
i told them everything
not the law
however the political complexion of these people does not give UNknown and i agree that a weekly UNknown paper cannot do him great harm
yet i wonder if sir should not be concerned with seeing this a little beyond the local level
all things considered i fear much less the inconvenience for sir 's affairs here than the deplorable impression given to sir 's friends elsewhere
will they like it ?
will they like it ?
as miss is sir 's niece and bears his own name won 't they reproach sir for failing to muzzle miss ?
yes they il know very quickly !
i think i understand miss
miss UNknown to destroy sir but it also seems that miss wants to give sir a chance
knowing sir 's silent partners a breed of UNknown usually blunt and very UNknown if i were sir
i think i should beat it !
i have the advantage to say sir is aware of how much i will miss him
miss may think i couldn 't care less but i have always thought sir very fine when he moves away like that deep in his own thoughts
my uncle 's not here ?
haven 't seen him
stop dreaming !
open up idiots it 's me !
what is it ?
when i say killers all signs show them to be professionals
among the victims a young lawyer ms muriel UNknown riot a lawyer working mainly in business the business concerns of her uncle jocelyn UNknown director of the firm
in any case it seems that this lovely young woman ms muriel UNknown riot was the main target of the killer
if i were you i 'd weigh up the pros and cons
i must be at the funeral
that 's how it is with UNknown
not when they drag you into all sorts
they only rarely drag you into the cemetery
finally you are a very conventional
that 's what i tell myself too
the carton behind you it 's UNknown
a guy who makes cakes the day they murdered his wife you don 't think he deserves his UNknown ?
you think they UNknown l shoot the baker ?
an adorable boy !
i can 't thank you enough !
this is the best story in paris
i told you ! revealed in a rather different light this afternoon with the killing of 4 people at a very mysterious business office on boulevard UNknown
by chance it 's director jocelyn UNknown also seems to have disappeared just before the massacre
this morning a 5th death has occurred near paris at UNknown
g UNknown you arrived this instant from UNknown
yeah but firstly a word
i UNknown l say a word about the victim
l on UNknown riot was a journalist and a few of us in this place will hold on to the memory of him as an adorable guy
he was shot 8 times
with 6 shots fatal
right it 's 7 UNknown
we 'r e going to take a break
with this boy was it ?
yes very much so !
i remember you admired me
no i didn 't admire you
i wanted you
there is no place in the world where you feel safer
wait until you see her place
her house is
it 's very old very beautiful
renata 's house is at the top
nothing can escape you you rule
you can 't imagine the grace the UNknown
you UNknown l see you UNknown l see
no one will ever find us !
i 'm homeless !
they burned my house
nobody knows what to say
i would say one thing
yes what ?
she loves me enormously !
i 'm sure she is moving heaven and earth
you 'r e repeating yourself !
whether i repeat myself or not she has connections everywhere
she is a princess
wouldn 't think so
discussions are tough
i UNknown e been on lookout since midnight !
who 's next ?
no really isn 't
she said for you i will knock on the highest door
what the UNknown ?
i cannot tell you what it cost me !
they took me to a bank
i can still participate
no you UNknown l never know
it 's very UNknown !
the fundamental UNknown is the existence of god !
if god exists it 's all good !
that all powerful hand you always guarantee it ?
it 's very UNknown !
the fundamental UNknown is the existence of god !
if god exists
it 's all good !
it 's all good
i don 't want to see him
he passed !
it wasn 't here last time
it wasn 't a big deai so we had it built
for the doctor !
don 't be silly woman
our boy 's so impressed he 's speechless
come on !
two bathrooms here and upstairs
the stairs are solid comfortable
come i UNknown l show you the upper floor
this can be your office
master bedroom with a back door
children 's room when you get married at last
and this will make a perfect guest room UNknown nice view
i 'm sure you and your wife will entertain a lot of important people
it 's internet ready and all
what 's the problem ?
the house can wait untii you decide
to come back
find his miss right
let me tell you something my boy
she doesn 't have to be pretty
a horse has to be pretty
a woman has to be pure breed
we UNknown e got pretty horses
you just need to bring us a pure breed woman
you do need a good match
men like you are easily hurt
for the mother her son stays a child forever
alright we UNknown e had enough
let 's have a man to man conversation
come with me !
i understand dad
i know dad
even the bible says a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife
you want to see the freak ?
come on !
i 'm totally absent minded today
it 's the wrong floor !
there 's plenty to do at home
i may lose you under the UNknown
hello ? !
serves you right for showing up on the wrong UNknown
and refusing st mary 's network !
i UNknown l tape it anyway !
on your pilgrimage video !
because you annoy the hell out of me !
where 's that UNknown ?
you UNknown l never find it
i lent it out
of the fourth republic
it 's to avoid confusion
i 'd rather make my allegiance clear
your dinner 's in the kitchen ! for it might turn out that we not only represent UNknown UNknown
but live in two different worlds
let 's get to the point
i consider these things essential
i had a sneezing fit again
are you sure you did the UNknown properly ?
we UNknown l have to check under the bedroom furniture there may be some dust left and it UNknown my nose
you were to get me the new pills
you forgot right ?
the nights are going to be cool they say
just be carefui not to bring back more dust or i UNknown l sneeze even worse
your preaching manner is better fit for the pulpit than the parliament !
the third republic you miss so much made this country the UNknown stable
that was a good one eh ?
rolled up !
to punish you for your UNknown
that 's very true
the books gather dust and UNknown my UNknown
moths dust UNknown
it 's my study
it was your study when you wrote
now it 's more like a UNknown hall
our savings are UNknown we UNknown l have to borrow from my parents
don 't stick in here if you won 't write
go get those UNknown
come out will you ?
maybe i 'm allergic to you ?
perhaps you UNknown UNknown smoke in secret ?
i think you 'r e allergic to yourself
the sun brings it out
when are you coming back ?
it 's a few hours work
don 't take too long
my anxiety is back
like when you were invited to give lectures
i don 't want to be alone
i left the UNknown behind in my office again
they used to call me UNknown back home did you know ?
did i sleep long ?
i 'm not sure
fifteen minutes or so
what upset me so
i was in my study
perhaps you were watching the news
i don 't remember anything
my neck 's bothering me
because you slept on the floor
let me make an appointment with the doctor for tomorrow
it 's been quite a while since he last saw you
who were you UNknown ?
i was setting the alarm that 's all
you UNknown e changed the password ?
darling give me the phone ok ?
i need to know who you UNknown
you should take your pills
why are you cheating on me ?
am i not good enough ?
please take your pills
i never remember
and when you wake up do you
sometimes feei unable to move ?
UNknown UNknown UNknown immediately after waking up
try to avoid extreme UNknown states
no peace no improvement
i 'm grounded here round the clock !
i want to live go back to work !
no such option yet i 'm afraid
you 'r e too vulnerable
you might fall asleep again
at the least desirable moment
but i want to be among people
this silence is head splitting
the time 's not ripe yet
please be patient
you have a caring husband a wonderfui home
doctor is it UNknown to have a UNknown dream again and again even though you don 't want it ?
and it 's so very real ?
that my husband is a goddamn son of a bitch
we must bring her body clock into line
she should sleep all night
i make sure she takes her pills
if she fails i give her a shot
proceed with caution
your wife 's UNknown is that she has no recollection of the moments prior to falling asleep
it 's rather embarrassing
thus she 's always thrill hungry but once she UNknown her desire she goes to sleep and the cycle repeats itself
if this UNknown she UNknown l never come back to the stage
how could i possibly help her ?
was it worth it ?
i played a sucker
i said no
i need his id
hang in there !
you UNknown e got to live right ?
having a high risk job you should get insured
we UNknown l put your arm in a cast bandage the broken ribs
no UNknown for the time being
a cast ?
pickpocket championship ?
in broad daylight !
got a UNknown ?
where 's this one from ?
watch out !
how are you mom ?
we agreed to respect your choices
the house can wait until you 'r e ready
now tell us when we could come to see you
we 'd bring you some goodies
i 'd do some cleaning ironing
i 'm sure you have no time to take care of that
just tell me when
mom i don 't really need anything
there you go again
besides there are ways not to get pregnant
but none is 100 sure
you 'r e such a nag
and all talk
i can 't concentrate
ever since i started sleeping with you i haven 't had dreams
are you sure you 'r e all right ?
you 'r e not quite yourself
a life without sleep is pointless
quit UNknown ok ?
try to write something !
even animals have dreams
be quiet ok ?
my dear certain messages are better voiced UNknown so that people can accept them as their own
how 's your writing ?
i can help
what ? !
get a grip on yourself and get to work !
or else we UNknown l have to support you
i 'm sorry i can 't
my words have worn out
wrong floor again ?
oh yeah ?
excuse me ?
there was a lot in the papers
by the way what do you do in this basement ?
you 'r e writing something ?
did he pay you at least ?
for spying on me huh ?
to hear that i peek at ladies panties instead of writing
he 's done that before to check if i 'm working
what really matters is finding a good UNknown point
do you see this window ?
for two years i UNknown e been UNknown the world through it
what do you see ?
how would i know ?
she 's going to an exam
in a navy blue high schooi skirt
it 's her third attempt
her friends are already done so for the first time she 's alone
her UNknown is usually like this
she UNknown l plant her heels down first
UNknown click UNknown the sidewalk
when she flunked her UNknown became uncertain
a drink or two to forget ?
what about this guy ?
walking back from work ?
four five six
when he worked he walked twice as fast
his shoes were shiny
i bet his shave is uneven
please give it to my father in law
it 's my new novel
what is this ?
i watched and drew conclusions
as time went by the apparent chaos began to fall into patterns
some legs would pass by always at the same time
i started to recognize people by their UNknown
details became important shoes and pants runs in UNknown
it seems that human lives resemble one another
i learned to tell people 's ups and downs from their legs
i started using index cards to keep my records in order and not to leave out any pair of legs
i substituted numbers for
the idea was not to miss anything and to elaborate on it sometime later at leisure
but i UNknown e lost my zeal
you 'd better go
how can you say that ?
ignore those UNknown that 's all they deserve
if someone heard you
big deal !
those twenty two make money
and yours ?
i found him this cozy job for what ?
he chooses to UNknown in a pad to kill the time !
what 's his idea of providing for you ?
you wanted a creative son in law !
and forbid me to shack up !
don 't talk to father like that !
we take a beating from everybody on this planet
we UNknown l screw up every game !
it 's in our genes !
are you hiding from me ?
how are you today ?
like newly born
not learning brushing up
i just need to access it again
i 'm hungry like a dog
better pour in some wine
i didn 't say open
is it good ?
not when cooked
are they the red kind with white dots on the cap ?
the ancient drug of UNknown it put them into a trance
nor in any store
and poison an army
i can 't talk now
i UNknown l call you
am i to apologize for your dreams ?
i have work to do excuse me
i swear i am !
it hurt me
quit snooping around
does it hurt ?
lock the door if you want to go out
your emergency money mom
help me up !
they broke my nose and took my watch
are they coming ?
try again ok ?
i found him on the street
are you sure it 's here ?
this is what i have
what a slum house !
adam my boy !
good morning !
you have a patient
how come ?
what about your watch ?
you go through my pockets ?
i bought it
your gang beat a man badly
i should report it to the police !
hey what 's your problem ?
what the fuck do you want ?
the news isn 't good
i warned you last time the problem was serious
the only option left at this stage is UNknown UNknown
there 's no knowing if it UNknown l work
your immune system is weakened

for money maybe
that i would make a new start someday
and now this bolt out of the blue
i didn 't live the way i wanted to
maybe at least i UNknown l die my way
no rush take your time
how long will i live without treatment ?
not too long
she can hardly tolerate my not being around
i need to prepare her
you need to have the will to live
but all i see is the will to die
final to put it bluntly
if you need anything
you woke up early
who was here ?
i can smell her
why are you doing this to me ?
you insult me and don 't even remember it later on
that 's what they call getting up on the wrong side of the bed

then i 'm standing over my own tomb ?
we 'r e all mortal

that premiere must have been a success
you walked happily barefoot shoes in hand accompanied by the same man as usual
it was the last i saw of you
i dozed off and crashed my car
amazing how much you know
more coffee ?
please stay untii my husband 's back
i 'm always alone isolated from the world
it 's good listening to you
the man who kept you company

what do you mean current ?
have you seen him again ?
you know something about him ?
come on tell me !
please be honest with me

i don 't want to inconvenience you
what if you collapse again ?
it 's hot
my husband believes i shouldn 't leave this place

poppy seed ?
it 's some sort of weed ?
very hot that dish
what did you give me ?
i love your cooking
sweet ann i 'm your man !
you UNknown e met her though you don 't remember
she 's jealous of you
she can 't believe that when you get aroused UNknown you go to sleep !
she rushed in once you froze
what are you doing here ? i ask
UNknown her you did fall asleep and couldn 't remember a thing !
i 'm tired of you sleeping and her making scenes
it 's hell
i UNknown e no time for myself !
it 's either you or her
plus i 'm not to stress you

that small dose was only supposed to stop you iying
how come you can listen to it ?
how could you do it to me ?

chill out !
you who else ?
apparently you were in my dream as another woman
what about your wife ?
aren 't you happy with her ?
i care for you
i dreamt about your shoes next to mine
with you around me i feei i 'm living again
it looks like your fits were caused by UNknown and not amnesia
you wouldn 't admit that you were cheated on and used the illness as a crutch
this way you felt your husband would stick around longer
that turned out to be a no win situation
you have my sympathy
you can live with UNknown
depression is more of a problem
how do you feei now ?
all packed up ?
but be aware that i regret it
i forgive you for being unfaithful
but not for iying to me
let 's keep the door open
is that all you came up with ?
what 's this ?
to kingdom come
honest in any case
what 's the matter with you ?
you 'r e out all saturday without my permission
now you UNknown e packed
what is it all about ?
i 'm leaving
pack and go ?
i 'm not leaving you
how do i explain ?
i 'm leaving everybody for good
i intended to do it for ten years to UNknown change my life
to pack my stuff and leave
but there was always a reason not to
i pitied you UNknown UNknown you loved me
i thought i loved you too i felt guilty i was too lazy
i kept postponing my life day after day
lodged by his former secretaries
stop him !
what are you up to moron ?
even if he wins the case his political career is doomed
i UNknown e got something for you
we were losing hope
with you in the spotlight again it UNknown l be a UNknown
don 't worry about promotion
i UNknown l handle it myself
i UNknown l be in the stable
any UNknown movement ?
thank you doctor
all he needs is peace and quiet
i don 't want to go to hell
first thing in hell they show you all your missed opportunities
how your life would have been if you had made the right choices
then you see the moments of happiness wasted when you were asleep
and what your life would have been like had you UNknown in time
then you 'r e left alone for eternity
there 's nobody and nothing
only you and your guilty conscience
the grand UNknown theatre
maggie got some info for us ?
she was attending a UNknown party at the theatre
when her ex husband just followed her into the dressing room and
made her watch the whole thing in the mirror
crime of passion
let 's take a look
a really good UNknown
i like maggie
we felt that for the good of the team it was just better this way
that what she said ?

five hundred twenty five thousand moments so dear
five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
how do you measure measure a year ?
in daylights in sunsets
in inches in miles
how do you measure a year in the life ?
how about love ?
five hundred twenty five thousand journeys to plan
five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
how do you measure the life of a woman or a man ?
in truths that she learned ?
or in times that he cried ?
in bridges he burned ?
or the way that she died ?
it 's time now to sing out
though the story never ends
let 's celebrate remember a year in the life of friends
remember the love

the music UNknown the night with passionate fire
the UNknown UNknown and pops with incendiary wit
zoom in as they burn the past to the ground
and feel the heat of the future 's glow
how do you leave the past behind
when it keeps finding ways to get to your heart ?
it reaches way down deep and tears you inside out
till you 'r e torn apart rent
how can you connect in an age where strangers landlords lovers
your own blood cells betray ?
what binds the fabric together
when the raging shifting winds of change keep ripping away ?
draw a line in the sand and then make a stand
use your camera to UNknown use your guitar
when they act tough you call their bluff
we 'r e not gonna pay
we 'r e not gonna pay
we 'r e not gonna pay
last year 's rent
we 'r e not gonna pay rent
cause everything is rent

whose charity is only matched by talent i must say
a new member of the alphabet city UNknown garde
angel UNknown UNknown
today for you tomorrow for me
and you should hear her beat you earned this on the street ?
it was my lucky day today on avenue a
when a lady in a limousine drove my way
she said darling be a dear haven 't slept in a year
i need your help to make my neighbor 's UNknown dog disappear
this akita UNknown just won 't shut up i believe if you play UNknown
that pup will breathe its very last high strung breath
i 'm certain that cur will bark itself to death
today for you tomorrow for me
today for you tomorrow for me
we agreed on a fee 1000 guarantee tax free
and a bonus if i trim her tree
now who could foretell that it would go so well ?
but sure as i am here that dog is now in doggy hell
after an hour UNknown in all her glory
on the window ledge of that 23rd story
like thelma and louise did when they got the blues
swan dove into the courtyard of the gracie UNknown
today for you tomorrow for me
today for you tomorrow for me
back on the street where i met my sweet
where he was moaning and groaning on the cold concrete
the nurse took him home for some UNknown
then i dressed his wounds and got him back on his feet
sing it today for you
tomorrow for me
i say today for you
tomorrow for me today for you
i really need your help
i hired joanne as my production manager and i don 't think she knows what the hell she 's doing
if you could just please baby come to the performance space
i mean first she just dumps me
maureen dumped you ?
now she wants me to help her fix her sound equipment
weil mark you could UNknown e said no
i know but
you should come
okay yeah i 'i i be there but first i got a protest to save
weil it 's christmas
you 'r e mark ?
weil don 't hold your breath
this is so typical
i UNknown e hired an engineer
he 's three hours iate
the samples won 't delay but the cable
there 's another way say something anything
test one two three
very weird fuckin weird
fighting with UNknown freezing down to my bones
and to top it all off i 'm with you
feel like going insane ?
got a fire in your brain ?
and you 'r e thinking of drinking gasoline ?
as a matter of fact honey i know this act
it 's called the tango
as she keeps you dangling you 'r e wrong
your heart she is UNknown it 's different with me
and you toss and you turn
cause her cold eyes can burn
yet you yearn and you UNknown and rebound
i think i know what you mean
this is spooky
every time so be cautious
did she moon over other boys ?
more than moon i 'm getting UNknown
where 'd you iearn to tango ?
with the french ambassador 's daughter in her room at miss porter 's
and you ?
it 's hard to do this backwards
you should try it in heels
she cheated she cheated
gotta look on the bright side with all of your might
i 'd fall for her still anyhow
when you 'r e dancing her dance you don 't stand a chance
her grip of romance makes you fall
so you think might as well dance a tango to hell
at least i UNknown l have UNknown at all
you pretend to believe her
cause in the end you can 't leave her
but the end it will come still you have to play dumb
till you 'r e glum and you bum and turn blue
why do we love when she 's mean ?
and she can be so obscene
i feei UNknown
first i just want to welcome you ail
why don 't we start by going around and introducing ourselves
i 'm here with
does anyone have a problem if i film a iittle of this for a documentary ?
make yourself comfortable mark
weil i 'm
what was your reaction ?
right now ?
i 'm a new yorker
fear 's my iife
because i 'm used to relying on intellect
but i try to open up to what i don 't know
because reason says i should have died
three years ago
no other road
well it 's gotta be close to midnight
my body 's talking to me it says time for danger
it says i wanna commit a crime
wanna be the cause of a fight
i wanna put on a tight skirt
and flirt with a stranger
i UNknown e had a knack from way back
at breaking the rules once i learn the game
get up life 's too quick i know someplace sick
where this chick UNknown l dance in the flames
we don 't need any money
i always get in for free
you can get in too
if you get in with me

looking for romance ?
no other road
but if you 'r e so wise then tell me
why do you need smack ?
take your needle
long ago you might have lit up my heart
but the fire 's dead ain 't never ever gonna start
another time another place
it 'd be another song we 'd sing another way
you wanna prove me wrong ?
come back another day
no other course
my only goal
there 's only now there 's only here
barging in on me and my guitar give in to love or live in fear

at the life UNknown ? after maureen 's show
i found myself in a desert cailed UNknown
it was hot
out of the abyss walked a cow
in UNknown we only drink
it 's like i 'm being tied to the hood of a yellow rental truck
being packed in with fertilizer and fuel oil
pushed over a cliff by a suicidal mickey mouse
i UNknown e
gotta gotta find a way
to jump over the moon
only thing to do is jump over the moon
his name we have iearned was benny
and although he once had principles he abandoned them to iive as a UNknown to a wealthy daughter of the revolution
a one two three that 's bull he said
ever since the cat took up the fiddle that cow 's been jumpy
the dish and the spoon were evicted from the table and eloped
she 's had trouble with that milk and the moon ever since
maybe it 's a female thing
cause who 'd wanna leave UNknown anyway ?
walls ain 't so bad
the dish and the spoon for instance they 'r e down on their luck
they come UNknown on my doghouse door
and i say not in my back yard UNknown
go back to china
climb onboard she said
i awoke singing
leap of faith leap of faith
only thing to do
only thing to do is jump over the moon
only thing to do is jump over the moon
over the moon

he can catch a bullet faster than a speeding train
he leaps tall buildings in a single bound
up in the sky
he protects new york from the forces of evil
the world has been protected by extraordinary men and women who have dedicated themselves to fighting crime
he has powers far beyond the UNknown of mere UNknown
i always wondered why nobody did it before me
i mean all those comic books
is everyday life really so exciting are schools and offices so thrilling that i m the only one who ever UNknown about this ?
c 'm on
that 's not me by the way
that 's some UNknown guy with a history of mental health problems
who am i ?
guess i was the last person you 'd expect to become a superhero
not saying there was anything wrong with me
but there 's not nothing special either
i wasn 't into sports
i wasn 't a UNknown or a hard core UNknown
i didn 't have a piercing or an eating disorder or three thousand friends on UNknown
my only UNknown was being invisible to girls
but out of my friends man i wasn 't even the funny one
like most people my age i just existed
good morning class
kick in my bedroom door you UNknown d probably find me watching tv
or talking to my friend todd on UNknown
you watching family guy ?
or jerking off
david UNknown don 't think i haven 't noticed you looking at my tits ?
oh ! i want your hand all over me dave please
sure a lot of what got me through the average school day was making deposits in the UNknown off warehouse for later
though to be honest i didn 't take much to set me off
i swear when hormones balance out shares in UNknown are gonna take a dive man
yes mrs UNknown
i like girls in my own age too
especially katie UNknown
hey look i 'm todd 's mom
oh that 's funny this is your dad
no that 's still my mom actually what the fuck ?
i was just a regular guy
no radioactive spiders
you know what ?
they just don t sell it in the store anymore
my mother was killed by an UNknown in the kitchen as opposed to a gunman in an alley
so if you were hoping for any
i will avenge you mother ! you 'r e outta luck
in fact in the eighteen months since my mother died the only UNknown i had was realizing that life just goes on
did they change the bee 's face ?
probably cause it 's fucking impossible dip shit
what putting on a mask and helping people ?
how is that impossible ?
that 's not a superhero though
it has to have super
super is like being stronger than everybody and flying and shit
that 's just hero
yeah but he had all expensive shit that doesn 't exist
i thought you meant like how come no one does it in real life
yeah todd that 's what i meant
dude if anybody did it in real life they 'd get their ass kicked
they 'd be dead in like a day a day
o k i 'm not saying they should do it
i just can t figure out why nobody does
seriously out of all the millions of people who love UNknown you 'd think one would give it a try
why do thousands of people wanna be paris hilton and nobody wants to be spider man ?
yeah what 's with that ?
she has like no tits at all
maybe it 's the porn tape
he doesn 't have a porn tape
you never saw one night in spider man ?
guess who ?
yeah must be terrible to have a rich dad and everything you want
i wish you hadn 't said anything
UNknown UNknown i feel like i 'm gonna start crying
no the fact that it
yeh but he 's always on his own
we should like talk to him
see if he wants to hang with us
i 'm not saying that we should talk to him but
think about it
if he was our friend no one would ever fuck with us again !
go on then todd
want me to talk to him ?
you are a pussy
you think i just UNknown my pants or what ?
when did you ever kick anyone 's ass ?
whatever man i would UNknown e just gone for his knees
you are not making sense
what i 'm saying is that in the joker portion when he got in UNknown when he vowed to penetrate the joker 's force field leaving him totally vulnerable
pussy patrol !
somebody else UNknown it last week !
look at this asshole just watching
come on be honest with yourself would you do anything differently
we see someone in trouble and we wish we can help
but we don 't
but i guess that would have been ok if bad guys were make believe too
but they are not
this fucking guy
this would be the guy that looks like batman
i didn 't say look like batman
you did tre
and you said like a mask and stuff and a cape ?
yeah like batman
our mole with the russians tells things a little different
according to him you UNknown e sold him my coke and you took the money
that 's a fucking lie !
i can 't believe that you would believe this shit from a fucking russian man
let 's see tre
that you 'r e a greedy little UNknown
or that all my coke was stolen by superman ?
and i UNknown gonna to disappoint him
joe you 'r e in charge
thanks that 's gotta be the worst fuckin excuse i ever heard tre
the movie is starting in 10 minutes
it 's o k we 'r e cool
we 'r e only gonna miss the UNknown
yeah but i wanted to get some popcorn
when we get in there get chris some popcorn
that 's fine get him UNknown and i UNknown l have an UNknown
gun shot in background
the comic books had it wrong
it didn 't take a trauma or cosmic rays or a power ring to make a superhero
just the perfect combination of optimism and UNknown
you are fucking awesome
be a big girl now
there 's nothin to be afraid of
is it gonna hurt bad ? oh child
only for a second sugar
UNknown bullet travels at more than ?
700 miles an hour
but it 's really no more painful than a punch in the chest
i hate getting punched in the chest
you 'r e gonna be fine baby doll
how was that ?
wouldn 't have been scared anyways
that 's my girl ! UNknown ay
up you get
bowling alley ?
i 'm gonna get hot fudge UNknown
good call baby doll !
so you gonna tell a little more about what you might want for your birthday ?
can i get a puppy ?
do you want to get a dog ?
just fucking with you daddy !
i 'd love a UNknown model 42 butterfly knife
know what ?
two ? yes
i UNknown l be honest there wasn 't a whole lotta crime fighting in those first few weeks
but even so my new vocation kept me plenty busy
i called it preparation
all i knew was i never felt so good about myself
but it was a start
what the fuck are you looking at ?
like every serial killer already knew eventually UNknown just doesn t do it for you anymore
it was time to engage
what the fuck ?
i said what the fuck are you looking at ?
two UNknown losers screwing with a car that somebody probably worked their ass off to pay for
say what ?
i 'm not high
just walk away from the car and we can just forget about it
you crazy man !
he promised he wouldn 't
all i knew was that my dad was gonna kill me
why can not i get a gun ?
i am the security guard
you 'r e a doorman now
you don 't get a gun no more
look at me
you look sharp
do your job
it 's a big thing frank
chris where you think you 'r e going ?
i gotta talk to dad
i don 't mind you talking business
i mean i should probably start learning and stuff anyway right ?
go finish your oatmeal
our russian says tre just sold them another 5 k 's at half price
which tre ?
or tre was telling the truth
what so this is my choice ?
i have to believe in ghosts or UNknown ?
not the part about the superhero franky
just that he UNknown really been UNknown by somebody
i think we better invited our russian friend over for a friendly chat
see what 's really going on
hey early UNknown

this UNknown covered individual has been all over the news this week
after this video of his intervention of street gang violence became the most watched web on the internet
on my space 38 press
kick ass is my favorite
16 000 and counting
and i was loving it
finally we want to know who is this man
does anyone have any idea who this wet suit UNknown is ?
he must be someone 's son
someone 's brother
this guy happened
UNknown 's favorite superhero right now is kick ass right ?

good at UNknown his ass kicked
he should call himself ass kick instead
that doesn 't even make any sense

but i tried my best
but more importantly i talked her into e mailing kick ass
long story short this particular lame duck of hers turned out to be more of a lame cobra
she didn t want the money back that she 'd given him or an apology for the black eye he 'd given her
she just wanted him to get that they were through and leave her alone

even with the good parts were totally UNknown
oh hey i read those old UNknown spider UNknown you gave me ?
they 'r e actually pretty good
yeah they are
that 's great
frank UNknown was the UNknown guy of them all and he came up with a plan to get rid of daddy
being framed as drug dealer was the worst possible thing that could have happened to daddy
prison was not his natural UNknown
he was very upset
and could not cope
and out of her death
mindy was born
and daddy started a plan of his very own
five years later he left prison
and he was ready
how 'd you find me marcus ?
one of us is still a cop remember ?
now you brain washed mindy ?
you say brain washed i say made it into a game
what you call this ?
playing damon ?
she 's safe can i see her ?
i miss her
i should warn you that asshole UNknown is looking for kick ass
he got something to do with you damon ?
you started some kinda fucked up superhero club ?
never heard of him
you keep carrying on like you UNknown e been carrying on and it s only a matter of time before UNknown 's looking for you
he 's been on d 'a UNknown s payroll ever since you passed up the opportunity
you know i 'm not gonna stop
not 't il d 'a UNknown and his whole damn operation are burnt to ashes
this is not the life for mindy
you owe that kid a childhood

he was so young
i just can 't believe he 's dead that 's all
oh i know
they get mixed up in stuff and
i know but what if it was my fault ?
what if kick ass did it ?
i mean i feel like should call cops or something you 'r e talking crazy ! there 's no way !

what the hell is that thing ?
you bought this to spy on the nanny when i was a kid don 't you remember ?
who the hell is this guy ?
i don 't know dad
but kick ass told me we 'r e not the only super heroes in town
maybe he knows who this guy is
i want this place locked down
nobody comes in nobody goes out
not until somebody finds this UNknown and blows his fuckin lungs out through his chest
they 'r e on to you did you hear me ?
they 'r e on to you
i thought they were looking for kick ass ?
i 'm gonna take a wild guess that was you ?
i killed all the cameras
hide yourself quick
it 's time for frank d 'a UNknown to go bye bye
x men fantastic 4
everything was out of control
i didn 't know what the hell to do
you ok dave ?
and there was no one i could talk to about it
i UNknown e always dreamed of being a super hero
but this was a nightmare
it was time to stop wearing this stupid costume
but there was one last thing i needed it for
what 's the difference between spider man and peter parker ?
spider man gets the girl
faintly from noise of UNknown hey i 'm kick ass !
i 'm kick ass

because i am kick ass
what are you talking about ?
and i 'm also not gay
oh my god !
i hate myself
i UNknown e never met anybody who was as beautiful and as kind and lovely as you
you deserve better
you should probably use the window
i 'm sorry i didn 't mean to scare you
we gotta get over the top of it and then into it right in the middle of her
daddy i think i found one
it 's perfect
and it 's three hundred thousand dollars
can you think of anything else you 'd rather spend it on ?
oh my gosh that is cool !
why are they fighting ?
that seems stupid
i don 't know
you would ?
i think we can make the next showing if we leave
alright you know what come here
i 'm going to request a great meal for you right now
suddenly i understood why super heroes only exist in the comics
i doubt why people didn 't risk their life for strangers because for the first time in my life
i had something to worth living for
something to lose
and the truth was
i hadn 't even checked the web site for like a week
ok i 'm off then
no katie tonight ?
you seem like a different guy you know that ?
your mom would UNknown e been so happy to see you out of your shell like this
have a good night
i gotta do that kick ass thing
this is the last time
i totally swear
i can 't help it
i care about you a lot too
this better be serious dude because i promised my girlfriend that i 'm done with all this shit
how about both of us being dead ?

you know what being a super hero actually costs ?
you happen to be in a lot of trouble here
kick ass !!
kick ass i 'm sorry
get in there
we had a fucking deal that would get you the guy who did it
all i 'm asking is you let kick ass go !
he didn 't do anything wrong !
chris you gotta look at this from my point of view okay ?
i gotta send a public service message to the people out there that being a superhero is bad for your health
and the big motherfucker ?
nobody knows who he is
yeah but that 's not fair !
life 's not fair kid
get over it
you really want to be a part of my business ?
frank we 'r e ready
enjoy the show
i sure am big brother
watch and learn
hey have you guys noticed he 's with katie obviously
why else would i be here ?
with no idea as to who is behind the broadcast of this show
but we could see wide spread server crashes
dave why didn 't you tell this is what you were doing
you 'r e on the news
and uh this guy here is big daddy
and these are my friends
come on in guys say hello
now big daddy and kick ass are gonna help us show you why being a hero is a bad idea
you know what a silent k is ?
that 's when k is at the beginning of the but you don 't pronounce it
like in the word knuckle duster
show them what knuckle duster can do guy
oh that must UNknown e hurt
let 's see that again on the other side go
oh yeah look at this
now in france they say the word stick like this
we 'r e gonna show you what they can do
go ahead boys
we don 't do UNknown m UNknown we do UNknown m all together
due to the distressing nature of the images we are unable to broadcast the events currently streaming live on the internet
it is now clear that the hostages are in genuine danger
that all signs point to the intentions to stage a live execution in the next few minutes
even with my metal plates and my fucked up nerve endings
i UNknown e gotta tell ya that hurt
the silent killer
like learn to drive
or find out what happened on lost
and if you 'r e reassuring yourself that i 'm gonna make it through this since i 'm talking to you now quit being such a smart ass
sunset boulevard ?
fire fire 's good
UNknown 2 rounds and relay UNknown
show 's over mother UNknown
she looks like she 's about 11 years old but
i can wait
i can see that this can be really difficult for you
are you ok ?
are you ok ?
that 's because i used low velocity rounds child
you 'r e the kindest daddy in the whole world
i love you dad good night
what 's your name ?
i mean your real name
a super hero never reveals her true identity
what look you can 't go on
however you lived before
any other family or ?
i can take care of myself
i saved your sorry ass ! what about money ?
alright cause you UNknown e got to think long term
i UNknown e got three million dollars in a suitcase !
that long term enough for ya ?
it 's not all about the money
i owe you
if it wasn 't for you my dad wouldn t be
look pack up whatever you need and we UNknown l go back to my place
i just need to clean up i think ?
you can 't take that stuff to my house
you know what my dad would have really wanted ?
he would have wanted me to finish what we started
and that 's exactly what i 'm gonna do
is this frank d 'a UNknown 's place ?
all that security
so i 'm sure as hell not gonna let my dad die for nothing too
you can 't do this on your own
then shut the hell up and pick your weapon
is that what i think it is ?
yo listen up you UNknown e got 5 minutes and i want you back on your post and don 't leave a mess
everything okay ?
look at that
what 's the matter with you ?
you okay sweetheart ?
you wanna use my cell phone ?
now can you remember the number ?
had i ever been a real superhero ?
the most i 'd ever had to offer the world was good intentions and a slightly elevated capacity to take a kicking
with no power comes no responsibility
except that wasn 't true
wait fuck this !!
she 's behind the counter she 's out of ammo
do you think they got her ?
if they didn 't he will
get out there
we got her trapped she 's still alive
so what the hell you guys waiting for ?
go get her go ahead
i only got one fucking gun
i 'm not going in there
do it now
everything is under control
sir ? do it
glory glory UNknown song in background
i never play
i UNknown l kill every single fucking guy or gal in my way
i wish my son was just like you
it is time for family reunion
you ok ?
bye good luck first school she 'd ever been to on the promise that i 'd look out for her
kick ass was gone but not forgotten
and my world is much safer with all the new UNknown
they said i was their inspiration
but all i did was make a door into a world i dreamed about since i was little kid
a world full of super heroes huh ?
like a great man once said
wait UNknown l they get a load of me
guardian of the universe
he can catch a bullet faster than a speeding train
he leaps tall buildings in a single bound
up in the sky
he protects new york from the forces of evil
the world has been protected by extraordinary men and women who have dedicated themselves to fighting crime
he has powers far beyond the UNknown of mere UNknown
i always wondered why nobody did it before me
i mean all those comic books
is everyday life really so exciting are schools and offices so thrilling that i m the only one who ever UNknown about this ?
c 'm on
that 's not me by the way
that 's some UNknown guy with a history of mental health problems
who am i ?
guess i was the last person you 'd expect to become a superhero
not saying there was anything wrong with me
but there 's not nothing special either
i wasn 't into sports
i wasn 't a UNknown or a hard core UNknown
i didn 't have a piercing or an eating disorder or three thousand friends on UNknown
my only UNknown was being invisible to girls
but out of my friends man i wasn 't even the funny one
like most people my age i just existed
good morning class
kick in my bedroom door you UNknown d probably find me watching tv
or talking to my friend todd on UNknown
you watching family guy ?
or jerking off
david UNknown don 't think i haven 't noticed you looking at my tits ?
oh ! i want your hand all over me dave please
sure a lot of what got me through the average school day was making deposits in the UNknown off warehouse for later
though to be honest i didn 't take much to set me off
i swear when hormones balance out shares in UNknown are gonna take a dive man
yes mrs UNknown
i like girls in my own age too
especially katie UNknown
hey look i 'm todd 's mom
oh that 's funny this is your dad
no that 's still my mom actually what the fuck ?
i was just a regular guy
no radioactive spiders
you know what ?
they just don t sell it in the store anymore
my mother was killed by an UNknown in the kitchen as opposed to a gunman in an alley
so if you were hoping for any
i will avenge you mother ! you 'r e outta luck
in fact in the eighteen months since my mother died the only UNknown i had was realizing that life just goes on
did they change the bee 's face ?
probably cause it 's fucking impossible dip shit
what putting on a mask and helping people ?
how is that impossible ?
that 's not a superhero though
it has to have super
super is like being stronger than everybody and flying and shit
that 's just hero
yeah but he had all expensive shit that doesn 't exist
i thought you meant like how come no one does it in real life
yeah todd that 's what i meant
dude if anybody did it in real life they 'd get their ass kicked
they 'd be dead in like a day a day
o k i 'm not saying they should do it
i just can t figure out why nobody does
seriously out of all the millions of people who love UNknown you 'd think one would give it a try
why do thousands of people wanna be paris hilton and nobody wants to be spider man ?
yeah what 's with that ?
she has like no tits at all
maybe it 's the porn tape
he doesn 't have a porn tape
you never saw one night in spider man ?
guess who ?
yeah must be terrible to have a rich dad and everything you want
i wish you hadn 't said anything
UNknown UNknown i feel like i 'm gonna start crying
no the fact that it
yeh but he 's always on his own
we should like talk to him
see if he wants to hang with us
i 'm not saying that we should talk to him but
think about it
if he was our friend no one would ever fuck with us again !
go on then todd
want me to talk to him ?
you are a pussy
you think i just UNknown my pants or what ?
when did you ever kick anyone 's ass ?
whatever man i would UNknown e just gone for his knees
you are not making sense
what i 'm saying is that in the joker portion when he got in UNknown when he vowed to penetrate the joker 's force field leaving him totally vulnerable
pussy patrol !
somebody else UNknown it last week !
look at this asshole just watching
come on be honest with yourself would you do anything differently
we see someone in trouble and we wish we can help
but we don 't
but i guess that would have been ok if bad guys were make believe too
but they are not
this fucking guy
this would be the guy that looks like batman
i didn 't say look like batman
you did tre
and you said like a mask and stuff and a cape ?
yeah like batman
our mole with the russians tells things a little different
according to him you UNknown e sold him my coke and you took the money
that 's a fucking lie !
i can 't believe that you would believe this shit from a fucking russian man
let 's see tre
that you 'r e a greedy little UNknown
or that all my coke was stolen by superman ?
and i UNknown gonna to disappoint him
joe you 'r e in charge
thanks that 's gotta be the worst fuckin excuse i ever heard tre
the movie is starting in 10 minutes
it 's o k we 'r e cool
we 'r e only gonna miss the UNknown
yeah but i wanted to get some popcorn
when we get in there get chris some popcorn
that 's fine get him UNknown and i UNknown l have an UNknown
gun shot in background
the comic books had it wrong
it didn 't take a trauma or cosmic rays or a power ring to make a superhero
just the perfect combination of optimism and UNknown
you are fucking awesome
be a big girl now
there 's nothin to be afraid of
is it gonna hurt bad ? oh child
only for a second sugar
UNknown bullet travels at more than ?
700 miles an hour
but it 's really no more painful than a punch in the chest
i hate getting punched in the chest
you 'r e gonna be fine baby doll
how was that ?
wouldn 't have been scared anyways
that 's my girl ! UNknown ay
up you get
bowling alley ?
i 'm gonna get hot fudge UNknown
good call baby doll !
so you gonna tell a little more about what you might want for your birthday ?
can i get a puppy ?
do you want to get a dog ?
just fucking with you daddy !
i 'd love a UNknown model 42 butterfly knife
know what ?
two ? yes
i UNknown l be honest there wasn 't a whole lotta crime fighting in those first few weeks
but even so my new vocation kept me plenty busy
i called it preparation
all i knew was i never felt so good about myself
but it was a start
what the fuck are you looking at ?
like every serial killer already knew eventually UNknown just doesn t do it for you anymore
it was time to engage
what the fuck ?
i said what the fuck are you looking at ?
two UNknown losers screwing with a car that somebody probably worked their ass off to pay for
say what ?
i 'm not high
just walk away from the car and we can just forget about it
you crazy man !
he promised he wouldn 't
all i knew was that my dad was gonna kill me
why can not i get a gun ?
i am the security guard
you 'r e a doorman now
you don 't get a gun no more
look at me
you look sharp
do your job
it 's a big thing frank
chris where you think you 'r e going ?
i gotta talk to dad
i don 't mind you talking business
i mean i should probably start learning and stuff anyway right ?
go finish your oatmeal
our russian says tre just sold them another 5 k 's at half price
which tre ?
or tre was telling the truth
what so this is my choice ?
i have to believe in ghosts or UNknown ?
not the part about the superhero franky
just that he UNknown really been UNknown by somebody
i think we better invited our russian friend over for a friendly chat
see what 's really going on
hey early UNknown
i wanted to get you breakfast this morning
happy birthday sweetheart check this out
thank you thank you thank you !
oh my god dad
isabelle it 's uh UNknown

chi bi UNknown
if you find out who that is i don 't wanna see any of you bitches sitting on your asses all right !!
what the fuck you ?
who is it ? it 's joe
what 's the problem ? yeah frank turns out man 's got the vice here no more
so where is it ?
i think you must be confusing me with someone who gives a shit about the fucking lumber
well you 'r e right i 'm sorry just grabbed the information
alright come on go ahead
hey look the guy told me he killed fernandez
what i know ? shut up
jesus fernandez is dead

he 's right i 'm sorry truly childish
well me and erika sometimes hang out after school at this really great store
if you like need someone to talk to ? sure thank you
man did you just see that ? !
yeah i really don 't think that 's the way it looks like
what are you talking about ?
the point is katie UNknown is all about the lame ducks
what 's that got to do with me ?
i UNknown e been trying to figure out how to tell you this
there 's a rumor going around right that you what ? are gay
well you know getting UNknown
you guys have been UNknown !
yeah i know but you know we didn 't get beat up and have all our clothes taken off
that 's not even true !

i should have quit of course
but you can 't just re program yourself what you want who you are your purpose in life oh no i 'm just stand around here

police sirens in background
how far would you go to help your fellow man ?
this UNknown covered individual has been all over the news this week
after this video of his intervention of street gang violence became the most watched web on the internet
on my space 38 press
kick ass is my favorite
16 000 and counting
and i was loving it
finally we want to know who is this man
does anyone have any idea who this wet suit UNknown is ?
he must be someone 's son
someone 's brother
this guy happened
UNknown 's favorite superhero right now is kick ass right ?
kick ass !!
good at UNknown his ass kicked
he should call himself ass kick instead
that doesn 't even make any sense
that guy 's gonna end up dead that 's what i think
are you serious ?
what you kidding me ?
i have 100 guys can fix a problem
you gotta some guy in some UNknown hose ?
well i wouldn 't wanna get in the way of your business where i 'm not wanted

and i just felt so sorry for him and more i found out about his up bringing and stuff i just
wow that 's weird

ever since i was little
i always wanted a friend like you
is it okay to say that ?
i mean it s not UNknown is it ?
i mean i don 't think you 'r e all the same or anything
of course not
but i tried my best
but more importantly i talked her into e mailing kick ass
long story short this particular lame duck of hers turned out to be more of a lame cobra
she didn t want the money back that she 'd given him or an apology for the black eye he 'd given her
she just wanted him to get that they were through and leave her alone
let s be real no other request could UNknown e given me more pleasure

even with the good parts were totally UNknown
oh hey i read those old UNknown spider UNknown you gave me ?
they 'r e actually pretty good
yeah they are
that 's great
frank UNknown was the UNknown guy of them all and he came up with a plan to get rid of daddy
being framed as drug dealer was the worst possible thing that could have happened to daddy
prison was not his natural UNknown
he was very upset
and could not cope
and out of her death
mindy was born
and daddy started a plan of his very own
five years later he left prison
and he was ready
how 'd you find me marcus ?
one of us is still a cop remember ?
now you brain washed mindy ?
you say brain washed i say made it into a game
what you call this ?
playing damon ?
she 's safe can i see her ?
i miss her
i should warn you that asshole UNknown is looking for kick ass
he got something to do with you damon ?
you started some kinda fucked up superhero club ?
never heard of him
you keep carrying on like you UNknown e been carrying on and it s only a matter of time before UNknown 's looking for you
he 's been on d 'a UNknown s payroll ever since you passed up the opportunity
you know i 'm not gonna stop
not 't il d 'a UNknown and his whole damn operation are burnt to ashes
this is not the life for mindy

oh i know
they get mixed up in stuff and
i know but what if it was my fault ?
what if kick ass did it ?
i mean i feel like should call cops or something you 'r e talking crazy ! there 's no way !

what the hell is that thing ?
you bought this to spy on the nanny when i was a kid don 't you remember ?
who the hell is this guy ?
i don 't know dad
but kick ass told me we 'r e not the only super heroes in town
maybe he knows who this guy is
i want this place locked down
nobody comes in nobody goes out
not until somebody finds this UNknown and blows his fuckin lungs out through his chest
they 'r e on to you did you hear me ?
they 'r e on to you
i thought they were looking for kick ass ?
i 'm gonna take a wild guess that was you ?
i killed all the cameras
hide yourself quick
it 's time for frank d 'a UNknown to go bye bye
x men fantastic 4
everything was out of control
i didn 't know what the hell to do
you ok dave ?
and there was no one i could talk to about it
i UNknown e always dreamed of being a super hero
but this was a nightmare
it was time to stop wearing this stupid costume
but there was one last thing i needed it for
what 's the difference between spider man and peter parker ?
spider man gets the girl
faintly from noise of UNknown hey i 'm kick ass !
i 'm kick ass

because i am kick ass
what are you talking about ?
and i 'm also not gay
oh my god !
i hate myself
i UNknown e never met anybody who was as beautiful and as kind and lovely as you
you deserve better
you should probably use the window
i 'm sorry i didn 't mean to scare you
we gotta get over the top of it and then into it right in the middle of her
daddy i think i found one
it 's perfect
and it 's three hundred thousand dollars
can you think of anything else you 'd rather spend it on ?
oh my gosh that is cool !
why are they fighting ?
that seems stupid
i don 't know
you would ?
i think we can make the next showing if we leave
alright you know what come here
i 'm going to request a great meal for you right now
suddenly i understood why super heroes only exist in the comics
i doubt why people didn 't risk their life for strangers because for the first time in my life
i had something to worth living for
something to lose
and the truth was
i hadn 't even checked the web site for like a week
ok i 'm off then
no katie tonight ?
you seem like a different guy you know that ?
your mom would UNknown e been so happy to see you out of your shell like this
have a good night
i gotta do that kick ass thing
this is the last time
i totally swear
i can 't help it
i care about you a lot too
this better be serious dude because i promised my girlfriend that i 'm done with all this shit
how about both of us being dead ?

you know what being a super hero actually costs ?
you happen to be in a lot of trouble here
kick ass !!
kick ass i 'm sorry
get in there
we had a fucking deal that would get you the guy who did it
all i 'm asking is you let kick ass go !
he didn 't do anything wrong !
chris you gotta look at this from my point of view okay ?
i gotta send a public service message to the people out there that being a superhero is bad for your health
and the big motherfucker ?
nobody knows who he is
yeah but that 's not fair !
life 's not fair kid
get over it
you really want to be a part of my business ?
frank we 'r e ready
enjoy the show
i sure am big brother
watch and learn
hey have you guys noticed he 's with katie obviously
why else would i be here ?
with no idea as to who is behind the broadcast of this show
but we could see wide spread server crashes
dave why didn 't you tell this is what you were doing
you 'r e on the news
and uh this guy here is big daddy
and these are my friends
come on in guys say hello
now big daddy and kick ass are gonna help us show you why being a hero is a bad idea
you know what a silent k is ?
that 's when k is at the beginning of the but you don 't pronounce it
like in the word knuckle duster
show them what knuckle duster can do guy
oh that must UNknown e hurt
let 's see that again on the other side go
oh yeah look at this
now in france they say the word stick like this
we 'r e gonna show you what they can do
go ahead boys
we don 't do UNknown m UNknown we do UNknown m all together
due to the distressing nature of the images we are unable to broadcast the events currently streaming live on the internet
it is now clear that the hostages are in genuine danger
that all signs point to the intentions to stage a live execution in the next few minutes
even with my metal plates and my fucked up nerve endings
i UNknown e gotta tell ya that hurt
the silent killer
like learn to drive
or find out what happened on lost
and if you 'r e reassuring yourself that i 'm gonna make it through this since i 'm talking to you now quit being such a smart ass
sunset boulevard ?
fire fire 's good
UNknown 2 rounds and relay UNknown
show 's over mother UNknown
she looks like she 's about 11 years old but
i can wait
i can see that this can be really difficult for you
are you ok ?
are you ok ?
that 's because i used low velocity rounds child
you 'r e the kindest daddy in the whole world
i love you dad good night
what 's your name ?
i mean your real name
a super hero never reveals her true identity
what look you can 't go on
however you lived before
any other family or ?
i can take care of myself
i saved your sorry ass ! what about money ?
alright cause you UNknown e got to think long term
i UNknown e got three million dollars in a suitcase !
that long term enough for ya ?
it 's not all about the money
i owe you
if it wasn 't for you my dad wouldn t be
look pack up whatever you need and we UNknown l go back to my place
i just need to clean up i think ?
you can 't take that stuff to my house
you know what my dad would have really wanted ?
he would have wanted me to finish what we started
and that 's exactly what i 'm gonna do
is this frank d 'a UNknown 's place ?
all that security
so i 'm sure as hell not gonna let my dad die for nothing too
you can 't do this on your own
then shut the hell up and pick your weapon
is that what i think it is ?
yo listen up you UNknown e got 5 minutes and i want you back on your post and don 't leave a mess
everything okay ?
look at that
what 's the matter with you ?
you okay sweetheart ?
you wanna use my cell phone ?
now can you remember the number ?
had i ever been a real superhero ?
the most i 'd ever had to offer the world was good intentions and a slightly elevated capacity to take a kicking
with no power comes no responsibility
except that wasn 't true
wait fuck this !!
she 's behind the counter she 's out of ammo
do you think they got her ?
if they didn 't he will
get out there
we got her trapped she 's still alive
so what the hell you guys waiting for ?
go get her go ahead
i only got one fucking gun
i 'm not going in there
do it now
everything is under control
sir ? do it
glory glory UNknown song in background
i never play
i UNknown l kill every single fucking guy or gal in my way
i wish my son was just like you
it is time for family reunion
you ok ?
bye good luck first school she 'd ever been to on the promise that i 'd look out for her
kick ass was gone but not forgotten
and my world is much safer with all the new UNknown
they said i was their inspiration
but all i did was make a door into a world i dreamed about since i was little kid
a world full of super heroes huh ?
like a great man once said
wait UNknown l they get a load of me
guardian of the universe
he can catch a bullet faster than a speeding train
he leaps tall buildings in a single bound
up in the sky
he protects new york from the forces of evil
the world has been protected by extraordinary men and women who have dedicated themselves to fighting crime
he has powers far beyond the UNknown of mere UNknown
i always wondered why nobody did it before me
i mean all those comic books
is everyday life really so exciting are schools and offices so thrilling that i m the only one who ever UNknown about this ?
c 'm on
that 's not me by the way
that 's some UNknown guy with a history of mental health problems
who am i ?
guess i was the last person you 'd expect to become a superhero
not saying there was anything wrong with me
but there 's not nothing special either
i wasn 't into sports
i wasn 't a UNknown or a hard core UNknown
i didn 't have a piercing or an eating disorder or three thousand friends on UNknown
my only UNknown was being invisible to girls
but out of my friends man i wasn 't even the funny one
like most people my age i just existed
good morning class
kick in my bedroom door you UNknown d probably find me watching tv
or talking to my friend todd on UNknown
you watching family guy ?
or jerking off
david UNknown don 't think i haven 't noticed you looking at my tits ?
oh ! i want your hand all over me dave please
sure a lot of what got me through the average school day was making deposits in the UNknown off warehouse for later
though to be honest i didn 't take much to set me off
i swear when hormones balance out shares in UNknown are gonna take a dive man
yes mrs UNknown
i like girls in my own age too
especially katie UNknown
hey look i 'm todd 's mom
oh that 's funny this is your dad
no that 's still my mom actually what the fuck ?
i was just a regular guy
no radioactive spiders
you know what ?
they just don t sell it in the store anymore
my mother was killed by an UNknown in the kitchen as opposed to a gunman in an alley
so if you were hoping for any
i will avenge you mother ! you 'r e outta luck
in fact in the eighteen months since my mother died the only UNknown i had was realizing that life just goes on
did they change the bee 's face ?
probably cause it 's fucking impossible dip shit
what putting on a mask and helping people ?
how is that impossible ?
that 's not a superhero though
it has to have super
super is like being stronger than everybody and flying and shit
that 's just hero
yeah but he had all expensive shit that doesn 't exist
i thought you meant like how come no one does it in real life
yeah todd that 's what i meant
dude if anybody did it in real life they 'd get their ass kicked
they 'd be dead in like a day a day
o k i 'm not saying they should do it
i just can t figure out why nobody does
seriously out of all the millions of people who love UNknown you 'd think one would give it a try
why do thousands of people wanna be paris hilton and nobody wants to be spider man ?
yeah what 's with that ?
she has like no tits at all
maybe it 's the porn tape
he doesn 't have a porn tape
you never saw one night in spider man ?
guess who ?
yeah must be terrible to have a rich dad and everything you want
i wish you hadn 't said anything
UNknown UNknown i feel like i 'm gonna start crying
no the fact that it
yeh but he 's always on his own
we should like talk to him
see if he wants to hang with us
i 'm not saying that we should talk to him but
think about it
if he was our friend no one would ever fuck with us again !
go on then todd
want me to talk to him ?
you are a pussy
you think i just UNknown my pants or what ?
when did you ever kick anyone 's ass ?
whatever man i would UNknown e just gone for his knees
you are not making sense
what i 'm saying is that in the joker portion when he got in UNknown when he vowed to penetrate the joker 's force field leaving him totally vulnerable
pussy patrol !
somebody else UNknown it last week !
look at this asshole just watching
come on be honest with yourself would you do anything differently
we see someone in trouble and we wish we can help
but we don 't
but i guess that would have been ok if bad guys were make believe too
but they are not
this fucking guy
this would be the guy that looks like batman
i didn 't say look like batman
you did tre
and you said like a mask and stuff and a cape ?
yeah like batman
our mole with the russians tells things a little different
according to him you UNknown e sold him my coke and you took the money
that 's a fucking lie !
i can 't believe that you would believe this shit from a fucking russian man
let 's see tre
that you 'r e a greedy little UNknown
or that all my coke was stolen by superman ?
and i UNknown gonna to disappoint him
joe you 'r e in charge
thanks that 's gotta be the worst fuckin excuse i ever heard tre
the movie is starting in 10 minutes
it 's o k we 'r e cool
we 'r e only gonna miss the UNknown
yeah but i wanted to get some popcorn
when we get in there get chris some popcorn
that 's fine get him UNknown and i UNknown l have an UNknown
gun shot in background
the comic books had it wrong
it didn 't take a trauma or cosmic rays or a power ring to make a superhero
just the perfect combination of optimism and UNknown
you are fucking awesome
be a big girl now
there 's nothin to be afraid of
is it gonna hurt bad ? oh child
only for a second sugar
UNknown bullet travels at more than ?
700 miles an hour
but it 's really no more painful than a punch in the chest
i hate getting punched in the chest
you 'r e gonna be fine baby doll
how was that ?
wouldn 't have been scared anyways
that 's my girl ! UNknown ay
up you get
bowling alley ?
i 'm gonna get hot fudge UNknown
good call baby doll !
so you gonna tell a little more about what you might want for your birthday ?
can i get a puppy ?
do you want to get a dog ?
just fucking with you daddy !
i 'd love a UNknown model 42 butterfly knife
know what ?
two ? yes
i UNknown l be honest there wasn 't a whole lotta crime fighting in those first few weeks
but even so my new vocation kept me plenty busy
i called it preparation
all i knew was i never felt so good about myself
but it was a start
what the fuck are you looking at ?
like every serial killer already knew eventually UNknown just doesn t do it for you anymore
it was time to engage
what the fuck ?
i said what the fuck are you looking at ?
two UNknown losers screwing with a car that somebody probably worked their ass off to pay for
say what ?
i 'm not high
just walk away from the car and we can just forget about it
you crazy man !
he promised he wouldn 't
all i knew was that my dad was gonna kill me
why can not i get a gun ?
i am the security guard
you 'r e a doorman now
you don 't get a gun no more
look at me
you look sharp
do your job
it 's a big thing frank
chris where you think you 'r e going ?
i gotta talk to dad
i don 't mind you talking business
i mean i should probably start learning and stuff anyway right ?
go finish your oatmeal
our russian says tre just sold them another 5 k 's at half price
which tre ?
or tre was telling the truth
what so this is my choice ?
i have to believe in ghosts or UNknown ?
not the part about the superhero franky
just that he UNknown really been UNknown by somebody
i think we better invited our russian friend over for a friendly chat
see what 's really going on
hey early UNknown
i wanted to get you breakfast this morning
happy birthday sweetheart check this out
thank you thank you thank you !
oh my god dad
isabelle it 's uh UNknown

chi bi UNknown
if you find out who that is i don 't wanna see any of you bitches sitting on your asses all right !!
what the fuck you ?
who is it ? it 's joe
what 's the problem ? yeah frank turns out man 's got the vice here no more
so where is it ?
i think you must be confusing me with someone who gives a shit about the fucking lumber
well you 'r e right i 'm sorry just grabbed the information
alright come on go ahead
hey look the guy told me he killed fernandez
what i know ? shut up
jesus fernandez is dead
fuck do i know ?
we 'r e not making a fucking hungry man dinner here just turn it on !

cause of the blood
dave what ? UNknown

he 's right i 'm sorry truly childish
well me and erika sometimes hang out after school at this really great store
if you like need someone to talk to ? sure thank you
man did you just see that ? !
yeah i really don 't think that 's the way it looks like
what are you talking about ?
the point is katie UNknown is all about the lame ducks
what 's that got to do with me ?
i UNknown e been trying to figure out how to tell you this
there 's a rumor going around right that you what ? are gay
well you know getting UNknown
you guys have been UNknown !
yeah i know but you know we didn 't get beat up and have all our clothes taken off
that 's not even true !

i should have quit of course
but you can 't just re program yourself what you want who you are your purpose in life oh no i 'm just stand around here

yeah i 'd rather die
you bring it on !!
police sirens in background
how far would you go to help your fellow man ?
this UNknown covered individual has been all over the news this week
after this video of his intervention of street gang violence became the most watched web on the internet
on my space 38 press
kick ass is my favorite
16 000 and counting
and i was loving it
finally we want to know who is this man
does anyone have any idea who this wet suit UNknown is ?
he must be someone 's son
someone 's brother
this guy happened
UNknown 's favorite superhero right now is kick ass right ?
kick ass !!
good at UNknown his ass kicked
he should call himself ass kick instead
that doesn 't even make any sense
that guy 's gonna end up dead that 's what i think
are you serious ?
what you kidding me ?
i have 100 guys can fix a problem
you gotta some guy in some UNknown hose ?
well i wouldn 't wanna get in the way of your business where i 'm not wanted

i 'm backed up right now your message has been sent
hey dave how about that coffee ?
yeah i just started
it 's got full UNknown and shows you leads that kind of thing
i 'm not really into UNknown UNknown or not
so guess you 'r e not gonna be lining up for that new kick ass comic then

no i didn t there was this one guy UNknown ?
and i just felt so sorry for him and more i found out about his up bringing and stuff i just
wow that 's weird
can i make a confession ?
ever since i was little
i always wanted a friend like you
is it okay to say that ?
i mean it s not UNknown is it ?
i mean i don 't think you 'r e all the same or anything
of course not
but i tried my best
but more importantly i talked her into e mailing kick ass
long story short this particular lame duck of hers turned out to be more of a lame cobra
she didn t want the money back that she 'd given him or an apology for the black eye he 'd given her
she just wanted him to get that they were through and leave her alone
let s be real no other request could UNknown e given me more pleasure
who the fuck you 'r e supposed to be ?

even with the good parts were totally UNknown
oh hey i read those old UNknown spider UNknown you gave me ?
they 'r e actually pretty good
yeah they are
that 's great
frank UNknown was the UNknown guy of them all and he came up with a plan to get rid of daddy
being framed as drug dealer was the worst possible thing that could have happened to daddy
prison was not his natural UNknown
he was very upset
and could not cope
and out of her death
mindy was born
and daddy started a plan of his very own
five years later he left prison
and he was ready
how 'd you find me marcus ?
one of us is still a cop remember ?
now you brain washed mindy ?
you say brain washed i say made it into a game
what you call this ?
playing damon ?
she 's safe can i see her ?
i miss her
i should warn you that asshole UNknown is looking for kick ass
he got something to do with you damon ?
you started some kinda fucked up superhero club ?
never heard of him
you keep carrying on like you UNknown e been carrying on and it s only a matter of time before UNknown 's looking for you
he 's been on d 'a UNknown s payroll ever since you passed up the opportunity

i thought they were looking for kick ass ?
i 'm gonna take a wild guess that was you ?
i killed all the cameras
hide yourself quick
it 's time for frank d 'a UNknown to go bye bye
x men fantastic 4
everything was out of control
i didn 't know what the hell to do
you ok dave ?
and there was no one i could talk to about it
i UNknown e always dreamed of being a super hero
but this was a nightmare
it was time to stop wearing this stupid costume
but there was one last thing i needed it for
what 's the difference between spider man and peter parker ?
spider man gets the girl
faintly from noise of UNknown hey i 'm kick ass !

you should probably use the window
i 'm sorry i didn 't mean to scare you
we gotta get over the top of it and then into it right in the middle of her
daddy i think i found one

that seems stupid
i don 't know
you would ?
i think we can make the next showing if we leave
alright you know what come here
i 'm going to request a great meal for you right now
suddenly i understood why super heroes only exist in the comics
i doubt why people didn 't risk their life for strangers because for the first time in my life
i had something to worth living for
something to lose
and the truth was
i hadn 't even checked the web site for like a week
ok i 'm off then
no katie tonight ?
you seem like a different guy you know that ?

kick ass i 'm sorry
get in there
we had a fucking deal that would get you the guy who did it
all i 'm asking is you let kick ass go !
he didn 't do anything wrong !
chris you gotta look at this from my point of view okay ?
i gotta send a public service message to the people out there that being a superhero is bad for your health
and the big motherfucker ?
nobody knows who he is
yeah but that 's not fair !
life 's not fair kid
get over it
you really want to be a part of my business ?
frank we 'r e ready
enjoy the show
i sure am big brother
watch and learn
hey have you guys noticed he 's with katie obviously
why else would i be here ?
with no idea as to who is behind the broadcast of this show
but we could see wide spread server crashes
dave why didn 't you tell this is what you were doing
you 'r e on the news
and uh this guy here is big daddy
and these are my friends
come on in guys say hello
now big daddy and kick ass are gonna help us show you why being a hero is a bad idea
you know what a silent k is ?
that 's when k is at the beginning of the but you don 't pronounce it
like in the word knuckle duster
show them what knuckle duster can do guy
oh that must UNknown e hurt
let 's see that again on the other side go
oh yeah look at this
now in france they say the word stick like this
we 'r e gonna show you what they can do
go ahead boys
we don 't do UNknown m UNknown we do UNknown m all together
due to the distressing nature of the images we are unable to broadcast the events currently streaming live on the internet
it is now clear that the hostages are in genuine danger
that all signs point to the intentions to stage a live execution in the next few minutes
even with my metal plates and my fucked up nerve endings
i UNknown e gotta tell ya that hurt
the silent killer
like learn to drive
or find out what happened on lost
and if you 'r e reassuring yourself that i 'm gonna make it through this since i 'm talking to you now quit being such a smart ass
sunset boulevard ?
fire fire 's good
UNknown 2 rounds and relay UNknown
show 's over mother UNknown
she looks like she 's about 11 years old but
i can wait
i can see that this can be really difficult for you
are you ok ?
are you ok ?
that 's because i used low velocity rounds child
you 'r e the kindest daddy in the whole world
i love you dad good night
what 's your name ?
i mean your real name
a super hero never reveals her true identity
what look you can 't go on
however you lived before
any other family or ?
i can take care of myself
i saved your sorry ass ! what about money ?
alright cause you UNknown e got to think long term
i UNknown e got three million dollars in a suitcase !
that long term enough for ya ?
it 's not all about the money
i owe you
if it wasn 't for you my dad wouldn t be
look pack up whatever you need and we UNknown l go back to my place
i just need to clean up i think ?
you can 't take that stuff to my house
you know what my dad would have really wanted ?
he would have wanted me to finish what we started
and that 's exactly what i 'm gonna do
is this frank d 'a UNknown 's place ?
all that security
so i 'm sure as hell not gonna let my dad die for nothing too
you can 't do this on your own
then shut the hell up and pick your weapon
is that what i think it is ?
yo listen up you UNknown e got 5 minutes and i want you back on your post and don 't leave a mess
everything okay ?
look at that
what 's the matter with you ?
you okay sweetheart ?
you wanna use my cell phone ?
now can you remember the number ?
had i ever been a real superhero ?
the most i 'd ever had to offer the world was good intentions and a slightly elevated capacity to take a kicking
with no power comes no responsibility
except that wasn 't true
wait fuck this !!
she 's behind the counter she 's out of ammo
do you think they got her ?
if they didn 't he will
get out there
we got her trapped she 's still alive
so what the hell you guys waiting for ?
go get her go ahead
i only got one fucking gun
i 'm not going in there
do it now
everything is under control
sir ? do it
glory glory UNknown song in background
i never play
i UNknown l kill every single fucking guy or gal in my way
i wish my son was just like you
it is time for family reunion
you ok ?
bye good luck first school she 'd ever been to on the promise that i 'd look out for her
kick ass was gone but not forgotten
and my world is much safer with all the new UNknown
they said i was their inspiration
but all i did was make a door into a world i dreamed about since i was little kid
a world full of super heroes huh ?
like a great man once said
wait UNknown l they get a load of me

well here it goes
leave the train and run
can 't think of anything else
stay away from me you dirty bastard
my records and my phonograph
that 's my job
ellis de UNknown
all those far away countries
i collect them since i was six
probably why i studied geography
first poland then france and now here
you UNknown e stopped with our queen
the UNknown stamps from the dutch india
i don 't know if i UNknown l ever get them complete
UNknown UNknown over here
so you don 't have to carry them
that 's not necessary
thank you very much
i 'd like that
quite a nice guy
and a man like that collects stamps ?
if he ever faces the wall after the war i UNknown l be glad to say
don 't touch that
they UNknown l get you
he 's my son
you know too much
mr UNknown there 's nothing more we can do
here take everything to UNknown
ellis you take the suitcases of the dropping
here hans call them
thanks to that arse called m UNknown they now have tim
wait a minute
you met this m UNknown in the train right ?
and he kinda liked you
the bastard adored her
he 's collecting UNknown
how far ?
that 's a rude way of saying it
i like things to be clear
is that what you mean ?
how far would you go ?
the customer remains king
over there in the office
you think of everything
after the train incident maybe a little ?
no not even a little
imagine a UNknown without his UNknown he can say bye bye
tell me about it
i never noticed
he always injected before a performance
en he had to eat a lot of chocolate if he injected too much
a never ending bother
the hospital will be happy with that
don 't ask so i can 't give away any secrets
it stings doctor
shall the doctor have a look at it ?
so i am still the first one
this time she looks like jean UNknown
we never got any further than the UNknown
and your parents and max
they joined you didn 't they ?
suddenly there was a patrol boat of the krauts and
who UNknown you over ?
a man from the underground
who was that ?
maybe even sleep with him
you 'r e on your own with that
can 't help you with that
i am here to see captain m UNknown
really and why ?
queen UNknown in person
you are being expected
i have family in the dutch india
they always wrote
i have softened the stamps off for you
i don 't want to damage these lovely stamps
shall i serve you ?
no don 't bother i UNknown l do that
take some of the chocolate
nothing special they were in a drawer in my place
almost all the UNknown stamps i don 't have
if you see anything of interest take it
too bad duty calls
then i UNknown l leave them here
is that bad ?
i have to go to a party
there will be much more to eat there
what if you could go home and pick up your phonograph and records and join me ?
how about i sing ?
all our successes had not been possible
your fight against the terrorists is our fight
with the f UNknown we fight for a free europe
i am not used to any alcohol anymore
but i 'm alright now
shall i sing some ?
general ladies and gentlemen
she will sing some for us
any requests ?
there 's quite many of them
i have lots of time
i don 't have any toothbrush for you
the loot is for the winners
your hair is normally black
blond is fashion now
so what ?
you were really great tonight
did he hire you m UNknown ?
you came looking for a job right ?
no but i am searching for one
but i am no party member
neither am i although i do agree with them
holland is after all a piece of germany
we all speak a sort of german dialect
oh nice real soap
what more do you want ?
we were talking about work
ellis would like to work for us
someone who sings such good german is hired right away
that is if you pass the inspection
if that isn 't healthy i don 't know what is
no no these are reserved for captain m UNknown
where were you ?
you 'r e married i see
nice kids you have
christina was with the children in the wrong hideout
and i wasn 't there
isn 't much
you haven 't told us anything
i don 't know anything
someone else put those weapons in the car
you are just a little piece of shit on our road to final victory
in a few weeks the russians will throw you in the sea along with your UNknown
are we here alone ?
the rest fled back to germany
could you come and sit here ?
so we can sit next to each other
type it out and copy it 15 times
you have spots on your uniform
it 's nothing just water
hurry up there will be more to do
if you read i UNknown l type
let 's take these of with them i can 't type
are these real ?
got it from g UNknown
nice huh ?
my father is head of the group
i want to talk with the germans about justice
justice here ?
with a guy like UNknown ?
a waste of time
i do not underestimate you
that m UNknown guy is quite nice don 't you think ?
could you give me a hand ?
we have to decorate the hallway for the f UNknown 's birthday
mr UNknown you are here
give me a spotlight
tomorrow we shoot UNknown m
just sign here
but they confessed they have to be shot
f UNknown 's order you know that
only i am in command here
no executions if i say so
to cheer him up
that 's sweet
actually i have to go home
so i won 't be seeing you tonight ?
of course you will
just a dirty kraut whore
we UNknown l get those after the war
shave them put their heads in tar and kill them
come on don 't be so primitive
that 's not what we fight for
i UNknown l fix it
none of your business
this could cost you your head
or save mine after the war
after the war i won 't be here
come let 's have a drink
it was a trap
what list ?
how do you know ?
UNknown UNknown i have been set up to
because i have seen my whole family being slaughtered
he poses as someone of the resistance
he tells jews that they can run for it just make sure to bring your money
UNknown waits for them kills them and finally robs them
so now there 's a new list of potential victims
we cannot let that happen
we don 't know who or where they are
what if we just kill UNknown ?
yes stop that bastard
we don 't shoot UNknown and 20 30 jews will be killed
is the life of a random jew worth more than a good dutchman ?
who decides that you ?
UNknown will not be UNknown
we do no more attacks and m UNknown promises not to UNknown
that 's enough ellis
that microphone of yours is absolutely brilliant
UNknown is also right
what if he just disappears ?
UNknown will know
or he thinks van UNknown has deserted
after he just promised him a new list ?
van UNknown is trying to cover up for after the war says so himself
if he disappears UNknown will think he just ran
there 's one thing UNknown and UNknown pass by too easy
someone has been setting up jews for a long time
van UNknown has a suspect
he UNknown l have to tell us
if i have to i UNknown l beat it out of him
i can 't
you alone know van UNknown 's face
we can 't do anything without you
you must be in
ellis take the chloroform
UNknown date 1941
that 's why van UNknown wasn 't knocked out
what 's still good after 5 years of krauts ?
van UNknown delivered the krauts tons
that brave warrior and UNknown handed me millions
and now he 's dead shot by god damn terrorists
i shot a man
yes i am
i said no didn 't i ?
i said god damn no didn 't i ?
the bastard had to die
besides what does it matter ?
that tim will face the firing squad
because you as a resistance hero had to go and shoot van UNknown
from the microphone we placed on UNknown
his best man killed
not after the attack you pulled
tim is as good as dead
but your jews are saved
only i shall face the firing squad
i will be beside you hans
i carry most of the guilt
i will join too
you 'r e all drunk
before you know it all of the resistance will give up because of gin
turning in is not a solution
then what is ?
the building plans of the UNknown office when it was still a bank
got it from a friend
here i am
i lost track of time at home
and then it was curfew and i had to sneak my way in
what do we have here ?
how dumb do you think i am ?
suddenly a beautiful woman comes into my life
later she comes to my headquarters
then she accidentally has the stamps i am looking for
then she UNknown appears to be jewish
and as soon as she comes to work here
UNknown 's best undercover man gets killed
quite a coincidence don 't you think ?
be silent and i will hand you to UNknown tomorrow
or you tell me everything now
only if you put away that gun
and kiss me now
put away your jackets and get to work
call all prisons and ask how many hostages they have
you can stop at 40 pieces delivery today
executions will be tomorrow morning at 06 00
those calls will not be necessary
lieutenant open your safe
none you are under the suspicion of robbing and killing rich jews
there 's nothing against that but you are accused of keeping their treasure to yourself
by not handing over jewish property to the empire you risk court martial and the death penalty
open your safe
saved it for our victory
your UNknown seems to have been mistaken
this person is always well informed
not this time
he promised them no more UNknown
even not for the murder of van UNknown
you negotiate ?
if we stop UNknown
which stays in force !
why shed more blood ?
russians in berlin
that is UNknown
police arrest this man
and i will lead the firing squad
and the keys ?

ludwig what 's wrong with you ?
go inside !
yes and for the UNknown of your jewish clients
how dare you
they were friends
by stealing of what they entrusted you with
you and UNknown
the hold up was your idea
you let hans and his men get slaughtered
wait a minute wait a minute
i wasn 't the only one
UNknown knew all this as well
but nobody will have his own son killed
every man has unknown depths
may i show you something ?
while we were in hiding
my wife and i tried to put things in perspective
i examined my agenda
didn 't we darling ?
and that is ?
just tell me
i have to keep you UNknown
that will be the canadians
every suspect deserves a fair trial
even the biggest bastard ?
come with me
please sit down
why is this man getting involved colonel ?
general k UNknown has very kindly offered to clear up this mess
who is this UNknown
he and m UNknown haven been conspiring in the last few months
to avoid bloodshed
you UNknown e got a nerve k UNknown
i consider m UNknown a liar who will say anything to save his own skin
of course who wouldn 't ?
we UNknown l get to the bottom of this
take him to his cell
if you allow me
m UNknown has been sentenced to death for high treason
the UNknown of german law are none of my concern
therefore the UNknown are UNknown and void
you have been misinformed
even after the UNknown
are you suggesting we shoot a witness ?
your own general UNknown has allowed us to discipline our own men
you can call him and ask
if you refuse to carry out a m UNknown 's sentence i will file a complaint with general UNknown
which you will no doubt regret
you know what generals are like
come on bring your shit buckets
go on move
maybe you can change your ways
look ahead !
heads up let me see your faces
look at them

golden ring number 23
can our own people do this ?
i don 't want the krauts to touch him
mr UNknown ?
ellis de UNknown ?
she has information names
will you listen to her ?
what do you have to say about it ?
usually his own patients
and UNknown who was a lawyer
hans knew how much money they had and where they were hiding
UNknown UNknown van UNknown
according to the red cross
none of them ever made it
lured to the UNknown and then murdered and robbed
here my parents
no but my brother got an acute appendix problem
they asked UNknown for help who sent in doc hans
it says here
not bad considering he wasn 't even a surgeon
then he called UNknown and turned them in
UNknown had van UNknown turn up and 2 days later they were dead
i don 't understand
this is the official german arrest sheet
dr a got out due to lack of proof
he made a deal with UNknown
UNknown UNknown everyone
did you arrest him ?
no he vanished
the suitcases with the loot are gone
i UNknown hans licence plate to all the checkpoint
where can he go to ?
belgium i think
that 's not far from here
here turn right
what 's happening UNknown ?
who are you ?
don 't do it
we can talk about this ?
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
dirty kraut whore
you 'r e going to die
we should be opening his coffin by now
yeah we should
it 's not ours
he 's silent now
about the past
hey dad you almost forgot my fishing pole
we wouldn 't want to forget that would we ?
no way !
ok thank you
you look great sweetie
i look like a whale
a beautiful whale
henry i know you 'r e the pastor but you can 't do everything
this is our vacation
you 'r e right honey
let 's enjoy our getaway
how much farther to the lake dad ?
we UNknown e been driving for an hour son
it takes five to get there
so we have four hours left right mom ?
very good jake UNknown
that 's all we had honey
be thankful there are a lot of children who have nothing
it 's not much farther
good because these mountain roads scare me
have faith we UNknown l be alright
his pressure is still little high so i 'm keeping him in an induced coma while we monitor head swelling
can he hear us ?
city rescue noticed the wife was pregnant and rushed her in
when they arrived there were faint UNknown on the UNknown
how is the newborn ?
she was just too premature
we did everything we could
i appreciate the ride brother
are you sure you want to stop here ?
this place looks dead !
thanks but this is as good a place as any
remember what we talked about
i 'm a hard worker
we have more UNknown this week
that 's terrible news
it 's really starting to cut into my bottom line
all i can say is once i 'm mayor your vacancy rate will be zero
we 'r e really going to make a difference around here
pretty soon the only thing i UNknown l have left is the restaurant
don 't worry my friend our plans and our agenda is out there and it 's winning UNknown everyday
first peter chapter two verse twenty one goes on to say
because christ suffered for you
leaving you an example that you should follow in his steps
jesus shows how faith in christ helped to save men because of the pattern or character he displayed for their imitation
dad careful !
is there anyone who can answer that ?
that 's it folks
i will bring back your jobs homes and the prosperity you once enjoyed
i promise to open businesses and create jobs
if you leave here with nothing else today
leave here remembering the word opportunity
opportunity for a new life
if you put your trust in me i will not let you down !
excuse me sir where i can find a place to sleep ?
there used to be one at the old church down the street on the left hand side
i don 't do UNknown appointments
i 'm not here for an appointment
i just need a few minutes of your time
come on in
no we don 't do the shelter anymore
how about some work maybe in exchange for a place to sleep for the night ?
sorry we don 't do those types of things here anymore either
i 'm an honest man looking for an honest day pay
can you help me ?
i 'm sorry i can 't help you
i wish i could but i can 't
are you alright pastor ?
you don 't look so good
things are really tough in this town right now
people just aren 't coming to church
lsn 't it when people need the lord most at tough times ?
that 's true
lsn 't that your role as minister ?
i wish you luck
i 'm sorry
i 'm fine thank you james
you 'r e looking particularly lovely today
you said you have something important to tell me
you 'r e right let 's quit the small talk
small talk is a waste of time and money
well look who 's here
this is my partner soon to be mayor alex york
it 's nice to finally meet you ladies
of course mr
mrs UNknown virginia
the city of raymond is dying
the crime rate is UNknown
jobs are UNknown
i have a plan to turn things around
what do you propose ?
to open up a hotel casino
it will open up hundreds of new jobs and bring money flooding into the city
those jobs will be filled by people from town
then we can get your rental income back up
the rent should be even higher
but gambling is illegal in this city
not for much longer
do you have the land ?
the 1st church of raymond sits on the perfect location
it has freeway access high visibility and lots of parking
you 'r e going to buy the church ?
the church has been an institution here since the town was founded a hundred years ago
that institution is dying from lack of interest and funds
you yourself hardly go
we UNknown l build it in a family friendly spot it will be bigger and better
mildred there is a motion that will be presented to the raymond city council making gambling legal
with york as mayor we know it will pass
but why not wait until after the election to buy the land ?
things are really bad at the church right now and we can get it for pennies on the dollar
how much do you need ?
the mortgage is five hundred thousand
they 'r e in UNknown as we speak
what 's in it for you ?
i just want this town to be an example
an inspiration to others
so we take all the risk and you get half ?
we already have everything in place
think about it
ladies thank you for your time
i UNknown l show myself out
i have a feeling i UNknown l be back sooner rather than later
i UNknown l be in my office
hi i 'm looking for the owner
i can fix anything
what are you doing here ?
i told you ma 'a m i 'm looking for work
this is a real estate office
i don 't have anything for you to do here
i 'm an honest guy
i just need a little work
you gotta a big company here you must have some odd jobs i could help out with
honest or not you have to leave or i UNknown l call the police
please leave !
feeding a man like that is like feeding a stray dog
give them one little thing and you will never get rid of them
but he just needs some food
i saw a man handing a man a twenty on a corner
when i heard him only ask for one
said do you really think it makes a difference ?
tell me why did you give him that much ?
he said i 'm just doing what i can do today
cause i might be in those shoes some day
looks like his chips are down
and i 'm just trying to help a brother out
can i help you ?
i 'm just enjoying the music
i 'm sorry but you gotta buy something to sit here
i 'm not bothering anybody and the table was empty
this guy is refusing to leave
i 'm not refusing anything
look buddy you gotta buy something or hit the bricks
do you think i can work for something to eat
i can wash dishes anything i don 't care
i ain 't hiring and i need this table for paying customers
right here gentlemen
don 't worry he 's gonna be worth it
is there a sign saying fresh homemade apple pie in the window ?
yup best in town
coming right up
yeah he 's good isn 't he ?
yeah he sounds real good
you fellas don 't look like you 'r e from around here
we 'r e record producers up from la
we came here to see max
do you record christian music ?
i like your sound max
i sing in church and i UNknown e always loved playing christian songs
i UNknown e dreamt about it all my life
and that 's why we 'r e here
but you will have to make some changes to your music
what kind of changes ?
changes to the style of music you play
we feel our songs will suit you better UNknown
i 'm ready to do whatever it takes
that 's what i wanted to hear
that 's good
does that mean i 'm gonna get a record deal from you guys ?
they 'r e going to give me a recording contract
they 'r e going to pay you ?
i am getting a ten thousand dollar advance
we 'r e going to be rich
i knew it ; sooner or later my boy would get discovered
what 's this ?
first thing i 'm going to do is tell mr clayton to take his rent money and shove it
thank the lord
well not really
their own songs ?
you should open your mail more often
look at this room
her mother is still in UNknown care waiting and hoping you visit and pray with her
oh the swanson 's called said they held off on the funeral as long as possible and decided to have the service without you
what else did they say ?
they said they were disappointed and wondered what kind of minister you are ?
i wish i knew
they UNknown e UNknown on the church
we have ten days to get out
ten days ?
to who ?
you have to stop blaming yourself
i don 't want to talk about it
it 's sunday don 't forget to shave
i don 't care
what are you smiling about ?
look at what i got a hold of
don 't get my hopes up unless you UNknown e got the goods
even the national UNknown can 't get the photos i have
where did you get these from ?
they aren 't stolen are they ?
let 's just say a friend of a friend took pictures of the pictures
eat your heart out richmond times
how 's that article on the new candidate alex york coming along ?
it 's going to run tomorrow
and after it comes out everyone is going to be excited about the gaming industry coming to raymond
miss norman ?
i read in the paper you are hiring part time workers
do you have newspaper experience ?
no but i promise i UNknown l do a great job
sorry we don 't hire inexperienced people here
what i lack in experience i will make up for with hard work
i don 't hire strangers never have never will
i 'm just looking for an UNknown to prove myself !
this town is starving but it 's not food these people need
what do they need then ?
the bible says like newborn babies one must crave pure spiritual milk so that they can experience the full glory of salvation
the bible ?
the lord wants us not to be greedy for money but eager to serve
how does serving the lord pay the bills or help build financial security ?
no offense but look at you
is it not more important to secure one 's position at his side in the place he has prepared for us ?
your name is burns ?
how do you know my name ?
i need to talk with you
i heard you got arrested for robbery and assault
so i need money and got some anger issues
what 's it to you ?
i need a man that can get things done
a man like you
things that need fixing
let 's see the money
i UNknown l give you twenty now and fifty more when you complete the job
that 's more money
yeah i UNknown e seen him around
i UNknown l make him take a walk
you know where to find me to get the rest
would he throw up his hands and just walk away ?
hey you were playing at the UNknown right ?
just playing with some ideas
do you mind if i show you something ?
it would be nice in my new song
i won 't
it 's not finished but let 's finish it
would he walk among the sinners fall to his knees ?
heal the sick save lost souls the way he used to ?
would he throw up his hands and just walk away ?
cry a tear for a world that 's gone astray
i 'm not sure but god i wish i knew what would jesus do ?
i love it man !
would he throw up his hands and just walk away ?
i 'm not sure but god i wish i knew what would jesus do ?
get over there
it 's time for you to leave
i 'm not ready to go yet
well it 's my job to make you ready
i feel your pain brother
what did you say ?
you feel my pain ?
you don 't know me
i UNknown e been where you are
someone who understands
i UNknown e walked where you walk
we UNknown e no less days to sing god 's praise
then when we 'd first begun
we UNknown e no less days to sing god 's praise
then when we 'd first begun
thank you max
he will be moving on with his singing career and we wish him the best
i had a whole sermon prepared for today
but sometimes it 's better to come right out with it than beat around the bush
ladies and gentlemen while i am grateful to see you here today
i bring you sad news
the bank has sold our church to a group of investors
i am sad to say they are closing us down in a few days
this will be my last sermon
it is my understanding that this church is to be demolished and a new one will be built at a new location
as you all know my personal loss has taken a toll on my duties as your minister
when the new church is built
i will not be coming back as your pastor
let us bow our heads in prayer
our heavenly father we ask that you help us understand
i UNknown e been wondering
if i die in the next few days which is likely to happen
i would like the satisfaction of thinking that i said my say in a place like this
i don 't know of any teaching of jesus that makes one kind of a man less worthy of saving than another
do any of you ?
i UNknown e been in town for a few days trying to find a job and i UNknown e not heard a single word of comfort or sympathy
except from your minister who said he was sorry for me and hoped i would find a job somewhere
i understand that you can 't all go out of your way and hunt up jobs for other people
but what puzzles me is what does it mean to follow jesus ?
you sit in a church and talk about following jesus
you even sing songs about it
do you mean that you are suffering and denying yourselves the way he did ?
are you really following his examples ?
would he even consider helping the destruction of the church so a casino could be built in its place ?
would he take bribes from corrupt officials and run UNknown UNknown photographs in his newspaper ?
would he use his god given talents to lead young people astray ?
would he throw others out on the street just to make a buck ?
would he abandon his congregation and community at the most critical time because of his own personal issues ?
what would the world be like today if everybody tried to act as jesus did ?
so what is the lesson here ?
when you find yourself struggling with life 's difficult decisions ask yourself this one simple question
what would jesus do ?
the heart is beating
he is resting
probably in his final stages of cancer
should we get him to a hospital ?
he said there is probably nothing more that can be done
i just want to keep him here let him rest and make his last days as comfortable as possible
let 's go
what brings you here to see me ?
the thing in church the other day is really messing with me
a thing like that can be very UNknown
how is the man doing ?
he is resting
he came to my office looking for work the other day and i just ran him off
i feel so bad
i don 't know how to describe it
it 's like an overwhelming emptiness
a sadness that i can 't shake
maybe you should seek professional help
you sound depressed
i UNknown l help you anyway i can
but you know i 'm no longer the pastor ?
i want to give it to the church
i UNknown e never gotten a donation like this
i just thought it might help
you are very kind but it 's going to take a lot more than this to save this church
i know reverend but it 's a start
well diana as you can see i 'm moving out today
but i UNknown l make sure this check get 's to the pastor of the new church
but what if we wanted our old church and pastor back ?
i don 't think that is possible
henry i have heard you many times preach that with god anything is possible
yes i did but i UNknown e come to doubt many of the things that i have taught over the years
have you lost your faith pastor ?
let 's just say i have been tested beyond my capacity to endure
i remember something else you taught us
what 's that ?
our best daily sales ever
what i lack in experience i will make up with hard work
i don 't hire strangers never have never will
what 's the problem ?
i UNknown e been very happy with how you UNknown e been covering the election
this is the biggest buzz we UNknown e had over an election in years
is there a particular reason you dropped by to see me ?
i have some more pictures for you
you UNknown e been UNknown the pictures ?
i hope i can count on your newspaper for the election ?
we UNknown l see how it goes
don 't go soft on me now
we 'r e almost there
i 'm not hungry
honest or not leave or i UNknown l call the police
it 's the land deal isn 't it ?
i don 't think i want to do it
why not ?
we 'r e tearing down an institution of good for one devoted to evil
but we are going to build a bigger and better church
the whole event today has really made me think
you 'r e talking about that man at church ?
i just don 't feel right about this land deal
i mean we are building a casino
that 's right a casino that 's going to give people jobs money self respect happiness and so on
since when did you start worrying about other people ?
i UNknown l pretend i did not hear that
jim i have a few questions about the songs
i don 't think they 'r e right for my audience
they 'r e a little too explicit
times have changed
the songs just capture how things are
i UNknown e been in this business a while and i know what sells
here is the advance i promised
get some new clothes
oh did you sign the contract yet ?
i haven 't yet
well get it un scattered
you need to concentrate on what 's important in your life
like signing that contract for UNknown
i know i just want to look it over again
i UNknown l get it to you in the morning
i need a little more time ok ?
i have a plane to catch tomorrow afternoon
i UNknown l come in the morning to get this signature
a package from our friend
we won 't run this stuff anymore
what 's wrong with you ?
nothing is wrong with me
are you crazy ?
but these are ours exclusively !
i don 't care
what has made you change your mind ?
if jesus was the editor do you think he would print this ?
i almost believed diana
you need a vacation
no what i want is to live my life as he would
but you 'r e not him ; for UNknown you 'r e a woman
i 'm not trying to be him
i 'm trying to live like him
i 'm so glad i turned down the profit sharing
what are you doing ?
writing a new song ?
is it one of the songs you were playing ?
i won 't
i turned it down
it 's only singing
what about my promise to your father to myself to give you a better life ?
private vocal lessons ?
i know mom
i 'm so sorry mom
but i have to do this
max you 'r e being a fanatic !
what about when we 'r e living in the streets ?
mom if i have to live in the streets to stand up for what i believe in then so be it
how is he ?
what is it ?
i UNknown l be by to check on him the day after tomorrow
thank you doctor walsh
where 's the story ?
what story ?
i 'm not running it
what makes you think you have a choice ?
it 's my paper
UNknown your little newspaper
are you prepared to lose everything ?
are you threatening me ?
get out of my office
this is not over
tell me what i must do to serve you
are you ok pastor ?
you don 't look well
things are really tough in this town right now
people just aren 't coming to church
lsn 't that when people need the lord most when times are tough ?
what are all of you doing here ?
can we talk with you a minute pastor ?
it 's henry
you mean with the man ?
yes how is he doing ?
the doc checks on him each day
not much change in his condition
he 's sleeping right now
what he said made us all take stock of our lives
i 'm glad you all are searching for meaning in your lives
that 's important
it 's obvious to me that there is a great yearning for spiritual fulfillment in this town
what would jesus do ?
and what do you think he would he do ?
he would save this church
save the church ?
henry what 's happened to your faith ?
with faith nothing is impossible
if you UNknown e come looking for faith you UNknown e come to the wrong place
but shouldn 't we at least try ?
pastor we need you
you are our pastor
heavenly father give me strength
this ain 't going to be easy
that 's the old henry i once knew
but how are we going to do it ?
we are going to ask ourselves one simple question
what would jesus do ?
ok but how does that save the church ?
we all agree right now right here that whatever lies ahead of us we will act as he would act
so we are going to base all our decisions on what jesus would do ?
like the UNknown bracelets ?
i 'm in
so UNknown on three
i feel weird tearing down a church
son that 's not a church that 's a dried up old shell of a building
if you say so
get out of the way henry !
i will not let you tear down this house of the lord
i UNknown e got a permit to tear this building down
if he won 't move then run him over
i 'm getting paid to tear a building down not run over a preacher
get off of there !
i UNknown l do this myself
i won 't say it again
get out of my way !
that book you 'r e holding won 't stop this UNknown !
the lord is my strength and my shield
we 'r e not tearing anything down today mr york
it 's over york
i have a permit to tear this building down
not today mr york
you may have won a small battle but i will still win the war
we will see about that
then i guess it 's a good thing that i own the church and not her
you know we haven 't heard the last of him
the lord 's house is once again open
thanks have a nice day
if anyone here is going to quit do it now
no hard feelings
this is our church and we are going to save it
i 'm really proud of you virginia
for the first time in my life i feel good about what i am doing
we UNknown e got a lot of work to do
i feel there is something i should tell all of you
especially you max
like the one you live in max
i 'm so sorry max
you 'r e supposed to be one of us
max we all are different people now
wanna know ?
how dare you sit in this church ?
don 't say that please max
max please forgive me
you were going to throw my family out in the cold
wait max because that is what jesus would do
he even forgave those who hung him on the cross
sit down relax
i will talk with mr clayton
we will move families back into their old homes
will you go to the square ?
it 's being considered
what are we going to do about this ?
we need to get to the root of the problem
we should take part in this coming election
put our own candidate in
that 's a great idea
how do we get own person elected ?
we need to take away that which gives him power
the people who have been drawn to him in town
this won 't change
coming out ?
he will lead you to believe that good times are ahead
right on !
i see a place that has died
a place that is inhabited by people that are starving for salvation
get out of here
get behind the fence !
keep your mouth shut
ok i UNknown l take it
hurry up !
break it then !
take it but don 't break it
don 't you remember me ?
do you know me now ?
life can be cruel
and how i promised to turn my life around ?
i knew if that could happen to a man of god like you then there is no god
the lord has a plan for each and every one of us
my mother used to pray
i can see her now kneeling down by my bed when i was a kid
didn 't help her either
maybe i can help you
the devil 's UNknown on me already
i 'm done
i said i feel your pain
my job is to make you ready
i feel your pain brother
that 's what the other man said to me
what man ?
come with me
i want to buy some of your properties
which ones ?
why would you want to buy those almost worthless properties ?
they are not worthless to the families that live there
you know about our church 's efforts
i would never believe you to be part of this non sense
but seeing is believing
the problem is none of you are jesus
we 'r e not saying we are
he 's all i have left
a great kid but he doesn 't have the brains
i need to leave him with something
you want to leave him a bunch of run down empty flop houses when you could leave him a nice nest egg instead ?
are you ok ?
are you crazy ?
i can 't believe you turned down the deal
i can 't believe i even considered it
i 'm considering reporting it to the da 's office
i really liked you virginia don 't spoil it
you 'r e hurting me
poor virginia just a lost confused pathetic little rich girl
hey what 's going on over there ?
are you ok lady ?
i UNknown l deal with you later
are you ok ?
can i give you a ride home ?
i am home
so how old are you really ?
i 'm one of them
how did you know ?
hey i live on the streets
word gets around
sometimes i wish there was something i could do
what 's stopping you ?
what can i do ?
i struggle just to survive
maybe i can help you with that if that 's what you want
because that 's what jesus would do
you can wear these till we get you some decent clothing
how did you become like this ?
i inherited this house from my
that 's not what i mean how did you become this way you know so nice kind ?
i haven 't always been a very good person but i 'm learning
what should i do with your clothing ?
you can put them in the trash
i never want to wear those clothes again
have a good night rest
i will see you in the morning
miss UNknown !
look what you are doing for me
like i said i 'm learning
now get some sleep
this doesn 't concern you
who did you bring home with you ?
a girl from the square
she 's in trouble and has no home
from the square !
that girl is going to rob us blind
she 's not a bad girl ; she is just down on her luck
down on her luck ?
the square 's full of people like that
take her back
well then here take her to a hotel and give her money for food
mother for once can you forget about money !
are you going through some sort of guilt phase in life ?
no i am going through a learning phase
i will not stay in the same house with a miserable
mother this house is mine
dad left it to me
your are welcome to stay here as long as you like
but i must act as i believe jesus would in my place
you can always remember that you have driven your mother out of your house in favor of a homeless street girl
is that what jesus would do ?
i am not driving you out
i am helping someone who needs it
and yes i believe that is what jesus would do
how is the young girl doing ?
she 's resting
would you like me to make you some tea ?
a raise ?
maria over the past ten years you have been a true and loyal friend
you have been there every time i have needed you
i have not taken the time to stop and thank you for all your hard work
miss page you don 't have to say
yes i do and by the way from now on call me virginia
friends don 't call each other by last names
ok then pass the cream virginia
she went into town to have breakfast with reverend maxwell
sit down i UNknown l get you some breakfast
so you are the girl that my daughter brought home last night
yes your daughter is helping me get back on my feet
you are a pretty young lady you don 't look like you belong on the streets
no one belongs on the streets ; you don 't plan to end up there sometimes it just happens
well how did you end up in the square ?
my father left my mother and i when i was ten years old
we were basically left with nothing
my mother worked very hard to try and make ends meet
she cleaned houses during the day and waited tables at night
thank you this looks wonderful
things were really tough for us
then when i was fifteen she started to get sick
she died of cancer a year later
and i have been on my own ever since
do you mean to tell me that you have been on your own since you were sixteen ?
i don 't have any that i know of
well young lady you have one now
what do you say you and i head into town and get you some clothes for a pretty young lady ?
we are going shopping
soon we will be able to win back our church
virginia has agreed to run against alex york
it is imperative that alex york does not turn our town into an unholy nightmare
pastor how are we going to do this ?
by offering the people what he cannot
what is that ?
sir could you remove this ad behind me ?
it 's been nice having a roof over my head
you need more than a roof over your head
a young girl like you needs a home
i UNknown e learned that dreams don 't always come true
you 'r e right
what 's that ?
i p ?
loren i want you to come and live with me
i want you to be my daughter
ladies and gentlemen soon i UNknown l introduce to you the person who will clean this town return the pride to raymond california
our candidate and the next mayor virginia UNknown !
but before that
since we started crime has been reduced 55 and soon we will be able to return all of you to your homes
look it 's york !
how can you do this to yourselves ?
to even consider these jesus freaks ?
you still have no jobs no real future and to top it off you have to live in the shadow of fear and UNknown
i UNknown e been working months to bring great things to raymond
money jobs self respect
there are two worlds we can build in raymond
one is built on the UNknown of peace kindness and good will
the other is an empty life of cheap thrills ugliness and greed
we are offering you the first
but you need to take the first step and reject this man and the easy path
you have to do what 's right
i 'm ready to defend this town
this ends today
low cost housing what else could you possibly want ?
wake up people !
the man in the church that day was right
we have to do what is right in our hearts
we all know that
get back here
you fools what are you doing ?
you won 't make a difference on election day
i 'm the future
it will all be over when i win the election
don 't you get it !
the people want me
are we ready ?
our new mayor virginia UNknown and she hopes to bring new hope to raymond
congratulations on your new album
this morning when i went in to check on him he was gone
i guess it was his time to move on
i guess so
ladies and gentleman can i have your attention please ?
first off let 's hear it for our new mayor virginia page !
did he just wink at you ?
stop it mom we 'r e in church
is there something going on with you two ?
well he did invite me to the church picnic
open your bible to first peter chapter 2 verses eleven and twelve
dear friends i urge you as aliens and strangers in the world to UNknown from sinful desires which war against your soul
live such good lives among the UNknown that though they accuse you of doing wrong they may see your good deeds and glorify god on the day he visits us
before i go on i would like to ask our good friend max walker to come up here on stage
come max !
he will do this right now
we did it by asking ourselves one simple question
i wrote this song with a friend
they stopped saying prayers in school yesterday and there 's a boarded up run down church down on third and main
the mission 's overflowing and the crime rate just keeps growing and i 'm not sure where it 's gonna stop
but man this world is all we got
what would jesus do in time like these ?
would he walk among the sinners fall to his knees ?
heal the sick save lost souls the way he used to ?
would he throw up his hands and just walk away ? cry a tear for a world that 's gone astray
i 'm not sure but god i wish i knew what would jesus do ?
what if he appeared right where you stand ?
could you look him in the eye reach out and take his hand ?
show him how we are changing this place day by day with his amazing grace ?
it doesn 't look like heaven on earth
so i have to ask are we doing right ?
what would jesus do in times like these ?
would he walk among the sinners fall to his knees ?
heal the sick save lost souls the way he used to ?
would he throw up his hands and just walk away ? cry a tear for a world that 's gone astray
i 'm not sure but god i wish i knew what would jesus do ?
would he throw up his hands and just walk away ? cry a tear for a world that 's gone astray
i 'm not sure but god i wish i knew what would jesus do ?
what would jesus do ?
who 's there ? !
who 's there ? !
what do you want ? !
some say the world will end in fire
some say in ice
but if i had to perish twice
i think i know enough of hate
to say that for destruction
ice is also great
i gotta focus
it 's just called UNknown
it 's not fair
where i am from it 's the way one says i love you
where i come from at my age
it 's the way one says i just got knocked up
so you 'r e worried about what people will think
you know it 's two out of three marriages end in divorce
well i think you UNknown l find the
vampire human divorce rate is a little lower
just marry me
four o UNknown lock on the dot
that kid trying to brown nose me now or something ?
he has a name
i know i put you through hell
yes you did
dad there is nothing you can say
edward is in my life
yeah i 'm gathering that
you 'r e not grounded anymore if
you use your new found freedom to see some of your other friends too
his dad 's really worried about him
i remember when that was you
you needed a friend jake was there
hey it 's jake
i wanted to fix it he just
he wouldn 't give me the chance
i miss you too
how 'd you ?
bella you have to understand
your safety is everything to me
jacob is not gonna hurt me !
not intentionally but the wolves have no control
and i UNknown l be one of you and he UNknown l hate me forever
i 'm sorry
my fellow students
no this will be my speech
when i want everyone to throw UNknown at my head
they have the bread and butter of all UNknown
and that is why you are not UNknown
and jess doesn 't need UNknown
speech is gonna be epic
i decided to throw a party
after all how many times we gonna graduate high school ?
a party ?
no one 's ever seen their house
a UNknown party alice ?
it UNknown l be fun
i know you know what she saw
i think that ship sailed long ago
i wonder what 's wrong
there 's someone missing in seattle over a year ago
charlie is doing what he can but
do you know something about this ?
we UNknown e been tracking the situation in seattle for a while
UNknown UNknown killings
if they go to seattle they can come here
they can see i 'm still human
we won 't get that far
but we UNknown l go to seattle if we have to
i UNknown l UNknown these down the first thing
no i 'm just dropping her off
see you later
airline ticket you got for your birthday
what airline ticket ?
wow that was generous
well i can 't just drop everything and go
it might be your last chance to see her before you graduate
yeah i wouldn 't mind seeing mom
as long as you use the companion ticket
wait just two tickets ?
super that makes me really happy
i did wanna see my mom
i wanted to know that her life was full by satisfying
aren 't you gonna miss this ?
don 't you just feel the vitamin d soaking up in your UNknown ?
yeah i 'm gonna miss this
you know colleges in florida are a lot UNknown
i 'm just saying if you go to university of alaska
i 'm never gonna see you
they have a really great science program
you mean edward program
it 's like he 's willing to leap in front of you and take a bullet or something
is that a bad thing ?
it 's an intense thing
you 'r e different with him
if he moves you move
you know cause you 'r e the one who 's gonna have to live with him
alright enough with the heavy
i didn 't come on
are these all our old trip t shirts ?
i thought they 'd make a good quilt
to keep you warm up in alaska
remember this one ?
this is amazing
i just figured you know when you get older have kids
we can add to it
maybe go visit the world 's largest UNknown bottle or something
i just thought you should have a little piece of me up there in alaska
she 's almost here
she UNknown l get away !
no she won 't !
emmett no !
just really hard saying goodbye
it doesn 't have to be goodbye
is that why you ask me to go ?
you thought i was gonna change my mind
i 'm always hoping for that
of course not
just checking to see if you 'r e still human
i 'm coming here to warn you
if your kind come on our land again
wait what ?
just leave it alone jacob
tell me what ?
listen to you
you should leave
she is the one the red head wants
by lying to me
i had nothing to say
well i have tons
i do trust you
lose the grin jacob
hold on tight
i 'm a vampire girl remember ?
look who 's back
maybe we can get a break from jake 's UNknown inner UNknown
i wish bella would call
i wish bella wouldn 't call
maybe i should call bella
maybe i should call bella and hang up
alright you can shut up now
bella this is UNknown UNknown
harry 's daughter
if you 'r e here to torture jacob some more feel free to leave
fun isn 't she ?
yeah same here
we 'r e good
so when did UNknown joined the pack ?
around when her dad died
her brother seth also UNknown
he 's only fifteen
sam keeps him home studying but he 's UNknown at the bit
wish it was UNknown who 'd stay home
come on don 't be such a guy
no it 's
we all have to live the UNknown sam emily pain UNknown
wolf telepathy remember ?
it wasn 't like that
sam hates himself for hurting UNknown
but emily was the one
yeah i guess it 's sort of chooses you sometimes
it 's more than some crush bella
sam UNknown on emily
UNknown on someone is like
like when you see her everything changes
all of a sudden it 's not gravity holding you to the planet
it 's her
have you UNknown on someone ?
you 'd know if i had
i just have a direct line to sam 's thoughts
so for now you 'r e still you
and you 'r e still you
not in a month !
i mean not before you UNknown e you UNknown e even lived !
or before i could
but he 's got his hooks in you so deep
i decided this not him
bella they 'r e not even a live !
it makes me sick !
better you really be dead than one of them
i can 't believe you said that
edward was right i shouldn 't have come
bella come on
i was just with jake
i was perfectly safe
i know i smell like a dog
i 'm sorry
someone 's been in here
who was it ?
a UNknown passing through ?
a UNknown by wouldn 't have left bella 's father alive
his scent disappeared about five miles south of bella 's house
someone 's UNknown this
it has to be the UNknown
i don 't think it 's the UNknown either
i UNknown e been watching UNknown 's decisions too
so we keep looking
a UNknown protection detail ?
and for victoria
well i 'm not gonna let you starve
and i wouldn 't be unprotected i have
it UNknown l be hard to miss when we cross it again
we UNknown l handle it from here
we don 't need you to handle anything
alright we 'r e done here
no you 'r e done here
from now on i 'm switzerland okay ?
edward hated the idea but it wasn 't about UNknown anymore
it was about my safety and charlie 's
in the days that followed i got them to at least try to work together
the wolves took over so the cullen 's can hunt
it wasn 't exactly an easy alliance
doesn 't he own a shirt ?
i 'm good here you should go
i 'm not gonna be going long
don 't rush
bike hike hang ?
you sure this is okay ?
i really hate being a party UNknown
technically you 'r e a council meeting UNknown
she took over for harry when he died
okay i should not be here
you 'r e okay
the UNknown ?
aren 't they secret ?
we all got a role to play
and you 'r e a part of this
i mean it 's the first time seth UNknown and UNknown are hearing them too
but you are the first outsider
and would UNknown e dressed better
paul 's been UNknown the grub
but i saved you some UNknown
good looking out bro
newest member of the pack
newest UNknown brightest
but we UNknown e always had magic in our blood
we were great spirit warriors
shape UNknown that transform into the powerful wolf
this UNknown us to scare off our enemies and protect our tribe
one day our warriors came across a creature
it looked like a man but it was hard like stone and cold as ice
our warriors sharp teeth finally tore it apart
but only fire would completely destroy it
they lived in fear the cold man was not alone
and they were right
our elder chief taha UNknown was the only spirit warrior left to save the tribe after his son was killed
taha UNknown 's third wife could sees that he would lose
the third wife was no magical being no special powers but one
long enough for taha UNknown to destroy her
she saved the tribe
but one remains
and we sense it now we feel the threat in our blood
something terrible is coming
all of us
i 'm so
just try not to get killed will you ?
i 'm gonna need numbers
seattle is in a state of terror
police are UNknown by the UNknown murders and UNknown
theories range from a vicious new gang to a wildly active serial killer
reporting live dawn UNknown
it takes more than one of our kind to cause the damage they 'r e reporting
quite a few more
it 's a UNknown
in their first few months after the change
that 's when we 'r e at our most UNknown vicious insane with thirst
something to look forward to
no one has trained these UNknown but this isn 't random
someone 's creating an army
oh now we definitely going to seattle
an army of vampires ?
and they UNknown e been created to fight someone
we 'r e the only clan even close to seattle
regardless of who are they were may if we don 't put a stop to them the UNknown will
i 'm surprised they UNknown e let it go on this long
maybe they 'r e behind it
in italy i read UNknown 's mind
he wants me and alice to join him
he knows we 'd never choose him as long as our family is still alive
an army could solve that for him
and his poor parents been UNknown seattle with these things ever since
you think they should just give up ?
i wouldn 't
UNknown i won 't be home for UNknown
why i won 't visit
why they UNknown l never see me again
after a few decades everyone you know will be dead
i UNknown e told you
be honest with me
i UNknown e lived through it and to let you suffer that
you believe i have a soul
i don 't
it 's the most selfish thing i UNknown l ever do
i thought maybe you were afraid that i UNknown l be too different
and won 't smell the same
you UNknown l always be my bella
my bella just less fragile
gosh it 's so pretty here
so alice is planning a big graduation party
which you 'r e invited to
yeah i figured that
to what ?
understand all your options
and i want you to choose me instead of him
i thought you understood
i don 't buy it
what don 't you buy ?
that 's how i feel
you feel something else for me you just won 't admit it
so i 'm not giving up
i 'm gonna fight for you
until your heart stops beating
well then you 'r e not gonna have to fight for long
you 'r e rushing into it because you 'r e afraid you UNknown l change your mind
no i 'm not
you wouldn 't have to change for me bella
or say goodbye to anybody
i can give you more than him
i mean he probably can 't even kiss you without hurting you
feel that ?
don 't do this !
she 's not sure what she wants !
don 't do this !
well let me give you a clue !
wait for her to say the words !
i kissed bella
punching my face
trying to walk and chew gum at the same time again bella ?
i punched a werewolf in the face
tough enough to take you on
don 't worry about it
okay any leads ?
but victoria continues to make appearances
go UNknown to someone else about the joys of becoming a newborn
i don 't hate you
i don 't particularly like you but
bella i envy you
i don 't care how miserable your human life is
my life is not miserable
it 's not perfect but nobody 's life is perfect
to be married with a nice house and a husband to kiss me when he came home
a family of my own
royce king was the most eligible bachelor in town
i barely knew him
on the last night of my life i left a friend 's house late
i wasn 't far from home
here she is
here she is
i told you she was a looker
it 's hard to say with all those clothes on
what do you say rose ?
why don 't we take off a few layers ?
stop it !
stop it !
they left me in the street thinking i was dead
believe me i wanted to be
carlisle found me he smelled all the blood
thought he was helping me
i 'm sorry
one at a time
i was a little theatrical back then
things got better after i found emmett
but we UNknown l always be this
frozen never moving forward
sitting on a front porch somewhere
emmett gray haired by my side surrounded by our grandchildren their laughter
i understand that 's what you want
but there 's nothing i UNknown l ever gonna want more than edward
you 'r e wrong again
after you UNknown e been changed there 's one thing you UNknown l want more
one thing you UNknown l kill for
something 's coming
and if you can 't control yourselves
we 'r e all going to die
what 's done is done just clean up after yourselves
they UNknown e already drawn too much attention
so has our UNknown
UNknown 's decisions are being watched
we must decide
or we end them
our answers were things like UNknown president
or in my case a princess
when we were ten they asked again and we answered rock star cowboy or in my case a gold UNknown
but now that we UNknown e grown up they want a serious answer
well how about this who the hell knows ?
this isn 't the time to make hard and fast decisions this is the time to make mistakes
take the wrong train and get stuck somewhere
fall in love a lot
major in philosophy because there 's no way to make a career out of that
change your mind and change it again because nothing is permanent
so make as many mistakes as you can
that way someday when they ask what we wanna be we won 't have to guess
we UNknown l know
too easy breezy too self helpful ?
you may admit it
what are you doing here ?
you invited me remember ?
was my right hook too subtle for you ?
that was me UNknown you
the kiss and your hand
i 'd blame it on the whole inner animal thing
but it was really just me
being an ass
alice what did you see ?
the decision 's been made
what 's going on ?
you 'r e not going to seattle ?
they UNknown l be here in four days
this could turn into a blood bath
who 's behind it ?
i didn 't see anyone i recognize
he didn 't start this
whoever did is staying out of the action
they must be playing with the blind spots in your vision
either way the army is coming and there aren 't enough of us to protect the town
hold up !
they were passing around bella 's scent
a red blouse
what the hell does this mean ?
it means an ugly fight
with lives lost
i wasn 't asking for permission
as long as we get to kill some vampires
and the UNknown won 't know they even exist
that UNknown l give us an edge
we UNknown l need to UNknown
carlisle they UNknown l gonna get hurt
we UNknown l all need some training
fighting UNknown requires knowledge that jasper has
you 'r e welcome to join us
you should be happy
you 'r e the one who wanted us to get along remember ?
they don 't trust us enough to be in their human forms
he UNknown l teach us how to defeat them
they want to know how the UNknown is differ from us
they 'r e a great deal stronger than us because their own human blood UNknown in their tissues
our kind is never more physically powerful than in our first several months of this life
carlisle 's right
a newborn army doesn 't need thousands like a human army
and no human army could stand against them
the two most important things to remember are first
never let them get their arms around you
they UNknown l crush you instantly
they UNknown l be expecting that
and you will lose
some of you are gonna get hurt
some of you could get killed because of me
it 's gonna be a hundred times worse than this right ?
we 'r e done for the day
your presence alone your scent will distract the UNknown
their hunting instinct will take over drive them crazy
i didn 't have quite the same upbringing as my adopted siblings
those bites are like mine
still i never lost a fight
this has happened during the civil war ?
i was the youngest major in the texas cavalry
all without having seen any real battle
when i saw her
i can never stop once i UNknown e started
what 's your name soldier ?
major jasper UNknown ma 'a m
i hope you survive
maria was creating an army ?
they were very common in the south
and cost a brutal battles for territory
maria won them all
my abilities to control emotions served her well
i trained her UNknown
it was my job to dispose of them
i could feel everything they felt
i thought what maria and i had was love
but i was her puppet
she pulled the strings
until i found alice
kept me waiting long enough
my apologies ma 'a m
i don 't know what i 'd have become without her
you UNknown l never have to be that again
what is it ?
unless she 's hiding behind them and she 's letting someone else decide
welcome to the army
if it 's victoria involved
i need to keep you as far away from the fight as possible
jasper said that i could be of help
we won 't need your help
with the wolves in this it 's an easy win
the rest of us aren 't gonna have enough to do
okay either it 's so dangerous that i have to hide
or it 's so easy that you 'r e gonna be side blind which is it ?
it 's dangerous for you
it 's easy for us
i think it 's dangerous for us to be apart
how many times we have to prove that ?
i UNknown l be worrying
you UNknown l be worried
and we il both feel more horrible
okay you 'r e right
so i 'm coming with you
no we UNknown e got to stay away together
i can 't make you choose between me and your family it 's
the only way i can protect you is to be with you
you 'r e not fighting ?
what you pull a muscle or something ?
he 's doing it for me
this field will give us an advantage in battle
we need to lure the UNknown with bella 's scent
it needs to end here
edward and i are going on a UNknown
even if he carries me they UNknown l still pick up our UNknown
your stench however is revolting
dude you really don 't want to start comparing stinks
what he means is that your scent will mask mine if you carry me
okay let 's just try it
UNknown de wolf comin up
or don 't you care about my safety ?
of course i care but you 'd say no
so i won 't have a choice anyways
since i let sam be alpha male
i got to live with the shots he calls
since you let sam be alpha ?
i didn 't want to be in a pack let alone be it 's their leader
some more than others
you can love more than one person at a time
i UNknown e seen it with sam emily and UNknown
it has nothing to do with UNknown
it has to do with
feeling something for somebody
i can sense how i make you feel
you 'r e going to be keeping that promise for a while chief
all i picked up was wolf stench
so you and i are having a sleep over at my house
charlie is going fishing anyway
me he likes
like alone ?
you 'r e welcome
no i 'm good
i don 't know
it seem to work out fine for her the second time round
later in life
if you gonna be physically intimate
don 't you just quit
it 's just as embarrassing for me
as it is for you
i doubt that
well you didn 't have a boyfriend ten years ago
i 'm sure things work the same way
edward is old school
oh my god
what are you doing here outside ?
what 's wrong ?
it 's really pretty
i think an air mattress would UNknown e UNknown
it is too much ?
anything you want it 's yours
do you promise ?
not the ones that support risk killing you
you won 't
that part doesn 't last forever
i want you
while i still want you this way
it 's too dangerous
i UNknown l marry you just try
stop trying to take your clothes off
do you want to do that part ?
i just want to be married to you first
you really make me feel like i 'm some sort of like a villain trying steal your virtue or something
it 's not my virtue i 'm concerned about
are you kidding ?
it might be too late for my soul but i will protect yours
i know it 's not a modern notion
it 's not modern
things were a lot less complicated
and if i met you back then i would UNknown e courted to you
we 'd have taken UNknown UNknown or had iced tea on the porch
i may have stolen a kiss or two
but only after asking your father 's permission
i would UNknown e got down on one knee
and i would presented you with a ring
this was my mother 's
and would you do me the extraordinary honor of marrying me ?
it will be a last minute decision
i told you how it works
the UNknown have powers
you UNknown l have the numbers but they UNknown l be able to anticipate your every move
according to your friend
but not before he told me
maybe he was wrong
you don 't trust me
with my life
i 'm doing this for us
so that we can feed without their UNknown
i can 't live in fear anymore waiting for them to attack
i won 't let them
i 'm going to end the cullen clan
if this is all i can contribute i want to be thorough
the UNknown will be frantic
it 's okay
it doesn 't bother me anymore
since when ?
you 'r e not wearing your ring
well i didn 't want to risk losing it
or risk jacob seeing it ?
i think we should wait to tell him
i mean at least till after the fight
if you 'r e having second thoughts
i 'm not
whose head is UNknown ?
nobody 's i hope
yeah i can feel it
we should get going
something up ?
same old same old
no i 'm staying
you 'r e not going to fight ?
seth will spell me in the morning
he 's not happy about missing the action but it UNknown l keep him out of trouble
let 's get you inside
i should have chosen a site lower down
no it 's fine
i can 't sleep with all that teeth chattering going on
and let 's face it
i 'm hotter than you
get your hand off me !
get your hands off her !
don 't fight
why ! you 'r e freezing bella
relax you UNknown l warm up soon
faster if you took your clothes off
i really get under that ice cold skin of yours don 't i ?
she just won 't admit it to herself
i can 't tell you if you 'r e right
then let me ask you something
if she chooses me
that 's an intriguing idea
i don 't want that
i never wanted that
if you 'd stayed away another six months
i could UNknown e made her happy
i have considered that
but you can give her a life a human life
it 's all i want for her
but i 'm not
the last time i tried it almost killed us both
yeah that i remember
how did you cope ?
there 'r e no words
but i wouldn 't wash it on anyone jacob
this might sound odd but i 'm glad you 'r e here
if we weren 't natural enemies and you weren 't trying to steal my reason for existing
i might actually like you
then i 'd let her go
i 'm really sorry about last night
i couldn 't have been easy on you
it definitely won 't make my list of top ten favorite evenings
you have a list ?
all ten i spent with you
number one is when you said you 'd marry me
i always wanna UNknown my name
you 'r e marrying him ?
he deserves to know
what can i do ?
you can 't do anything
maybe i UNknown l get my self killed and make it simple for you
because i don 't wanna lose you
it 's not good enough
because you 'r e too important
still not good enough
that should have been our first kiss
i gotta go
i don 't know what happened
you love him
she knew you 'd be with me
she found us
but she knows i UNknown l kill you
in fact she UNknown l be glad she doesn 't have to deal with you anymore
don 't listen riley
i can read her mind so i know what she thinks of you
he 's lying
it 's the only thing she cares about
that 's the only reason she chose you
she doesn 't love you
you know i love you
you 'r e dead
you want her !
when i tore him to pieces
when i turned him into ash
when i turned him into nothing
the UNknown won 't honor a truce with the UNknown
UNknown don 't !
the bones on the right half of his body are shattered
jacob you idiot
it 's already starting
we 'r e not gonna win a fight with the UNknown
we UNknown l take him back to billy 's
i UNknown l be there as soon as i can
hang in there jake
we were lucky
if you 'd arrived a half hour ago you would UNknown e fulfilled your purpose
that wasn 't yours to offer
why did you come ?
who created you ?
she UNknown l tell you anything you want to know
he said our thoughts weren 't safe
her name was victoria
isn 't that right jane ?
we UNknown l take responsibility for her
give her a chance
keep that in mind
the date is set
i 'd like to go home
it 's been going on for a while
doc 's UNknown his bones

i UNknown l come back to set up a drip
you were worried about me ?
was he hard on you ?
he wasn 't even mad at me
he 's not playing a game
i know who he is
i must not talk about that
i 'd rather get all the UNknown done at once
at least i know i did everything i could
wasn 't easy making you admit your feelings for me
i only fought them because i know they wouldn 't change anything
i 'm exactly right for you bella
it would be as easy as breathing with me
you know i love you
you know how much i wish it was enough
should i come back ?
i need some time
UNknown my heart stops beating
maybe even then
i don 't need to be another year older than you

like literally stumbling through my life
i 'm never felt normal
because i 'm not normal
i don 't wanna be
i UNknown e had to face death and loss and pain in your world
but i UNknown e also never felt stronger more real more my self
because it 's my world too

starting with a wedding

dr raymond moody author UNknown after life
will be speaking at the university
of south carolina thursday 4 00 p m
about the near death experience
i had one of those
oh hell UNknown this guy 's just another phony
he 's selling books is all
i got to go see him
oh god dog
well he could tell you you 'r e not crazy
thus the vast majority of subjects
no matter what their religious or their cultural background may be all report UNknown similar experiences
now while i have met no single individual
who reports all of these UNknown
these elements UNknown again and again in these experiences
that 's what i call
the near death experience
i had one
i was dead for 28 minutes and while i was dead
these beings made of light they showed me my whole life and then i went to this city
it was a UNknown city and i went into this cathedral and there was more of them
there was 13 of them these beings
they showed me like movies
these things from the future
these terrible things
this is all easily UNknown
when the human organism is dying
the UNknown is deprived of oxygen
in fact this oxygen UNknown
begins along the outer UNknown
and in effect moves inward
explaining the tunnel effect
while i am sure that he had a UNknown experience
i doubt that he paid a visit to heaven
well doctor you are certainly entitled to your doubts
that 's your job
but my hobby 's believing
have you ever had a near death experience yourself doctor ?
i don 't know what 's true anymore
because if it is you UNknown e possibly had the most extensive experience that i UNknown e come across
and so what do you say to a beer ?
you drink beer ?
i liked what that guy said in there
i liked it UNknown UNknown i came here to ease my mind
and if none of it ever happened like he claims
then i got what i came for
so i can just go home and forget about it
that 's just exactly what i 'm going to go and do
no you won 't
where is that ?
that still ain 't worth beans
probably pull a 4 9 split
tell him i 'm not home
4 9 split one to pick up
he UNknown l pick this one up off the floor
he says he knows you 'r e here cause i 'm talking to you
tell him i died and went to heaven and he picks it up off the floor
you don 't see that often
he says that 's all right
would you like to tell him about it ?
looks like the 8 pin 's left standing
you know i do believe
we ain 't been out to the horse track in ages
oh yeah !
i told you it 's not for sale
look look it 's my car
it 's my car
you UNknown l what ?
just name your price
yeah and what are you doing at it ?
well i was just in the neighborhood and
says you 'r e doing well
she call you ?
uh did you have any incidents ?
such as what ?
your near death experience is
i UNknown l tell you something about my experience
all right ?
i 'm going to beat the life out of him
so get yourself another guinea pig doctor
i got a life and i like it
you don 't like it UNknown
you didn 't beat that guy up because you couldn 't
because you knew you shouldn 't
that 's a whole new feeling for you and you don 't know how to deal with it
have any dreams lately ?
what are they about ?
just what the hell do you want with me ?
i want to understand and you need to understand
i think that would work well UNknown
thanks but no thanks
okay this one is for you
how many of these can we drink UNknown ?
well you better drink it all up
cause there 's a prize for you at the bottom
nothing says i love you all over again like diamonds
i don 't want it
you don 't want what ?
but it 's it 's like stealing danny
with your with your power
it just isn 't right and i don 't want it
well you didn 't want me crazy either and you didn 't want me a cripple and now and now my money isn 't good enough for you
why is that casey ?
why is it that i 'm the one UNknown
like some kind of freak
eating with my hands passing out
and i 'm the one feeling guilty ?
why is it that everybody wants me to be something different
but they don 't tell me what ?
give me a reason huh ?
the way it was when ?
hey you ain 't never been happy with the way i was
things ain 't ever going to be the way they was casey ever
come on let 's go !
post time !
no i can handle it
i don 't bite
somebody jammed it on there so you push just like
you got it
something terrible terrible was about to happen
what 's going to happen danny ?
i stopped it
i made it happen
it 's not true UNknown
you didn 't make
now you wanted to help me ?
you wanted to study me ?
okay start with that
you can only try and change people
you can try and change their hearts their UNknown
set them on the right path
but it is up to them to follow it
what are you ?
that 's going to make me feel any different
about being some kind of freak ?
how you going to fix that ?
a freak is only one person that 's different
there are a lot of people like you
how many ?
you know from the future
and you don 't remember any of them ?
who 's that ?
can 't be
now what do other people who live say ?
UNknown you 'r e the first one that 's come back with a list
well they told me they said that
all of us everybody
we 'r e from there and that we 'r e all on the earth and doing god 's work
you know trying to fix it
and we 'r e all we 'r e all like soldiers
i like that being like a soldier and that you know some succeed and some fail but that
we 'r e all heroes just for being here
that 's what they said
about what ?
what am i supposed to do with that ?
well what do you think you should do about that ?
well i don 't know
i was thinking maybe i might give it a try
hi sweetie pie
what are you doing ?
living with love
you need a new suit to do that ?
well i wanted to look my best
all right now
where you going ?
i thought i 'd walk around town and
try to love thy neighbor
what makes you think you UNknown e been forgiven
for all you UNknown e done ?
not one person in this town hasn 't been hurt by you
now you decide it 's time for love
haven 't you done enough to humiliate us ?
it 's not about us case
damn right it 's not about us UNknown and it hasn 't been about us for a long time
it 's all about you
i didn 't choose this you know
but i don 't do something about it
i 'm going to lose my mind
and here i thought you already had
i was thinking that maybe you and me
could get us a beer
that UNknown l be the day
now why don 't you just get on out of here
before i take these UNknown to you
just a beer leonard
oh come on
i know i can
you can spread the word cause everybody listens to you
i only wish they had sense enough to bury you when they had opportunity
isn 't it at least fair to give me a chance leonard ?
is that too much to ask for ?
when did you ever give anybody else a chance ?
even when they were begging
hold on hold on
i 'm a different man now
sure i do
you hungry armstrong ?
there you go
just fine now that you 'r e here grace ann
ain 't you sweet ?
what can i get for you ?
just your smiling face
same for him
what do you think ?
i think we can arrange that
hey baby you want to go out ?
you want to go out honey ?
here you go sweetheart
let go of me
let go of me
take me home take me home
take me home !
does the number six bus come by here ?
what happened ?
and i tried raymond
people in this town they 'r e never going to forget and they sure as hell won 't forgive me
i 'm a mess raymond
i 'm just a mess
what do you want ?
i got so much making up to do and i don 't think i 'm going to have the time to do it
i want to help people
i need to know what that feels like
but they just won 't let me
come with me
you come where some people are willing to believe
people that want your help
i just don 't understand why you have to go to cincinnati
i 'm not going to cincinnati
i 'm going to all kinds of cities
all over the country
and i UNknown l call you every single night i promise
what are you looking for UNknown ?
i 'm looking to get up in the morning and find out where i fit in
this is where you fit in
perhaps one day people will come to accept
that there is another dimension of existence
to which the soul passes after death
meanwhile to UNknown a friend of mine
people who UNknown e had these experiences know
people who haven 't
please answer one question for me
mr UNknown ?
can you tell me where he is ?
he 's dead
same way you do
it felt like ice
you 'd rather not know
you were dead
i grabbed on to a thousand UNknown line
it 's a pleasure to meet you
you want a beer ?
dead 28 minutes
so i just told my wife
how 'd she react ?
thought i was crazy but it 's not a big deal to her
it was a big deal to my husband
i couldn 't stop talking about it
and he didn 't want to hear about it anymore
so i got a divorce
for the longest time he was all i wanted
well then why 'd you divorce him ?
we grew apart
you 'r e married ?
sure she does
i love you more than anything
we 'r e going to make it work
i UNknown l be home real soon and we will make it work
we been at this for three weeks and eight cities
and everywhere we go people
people keep treating me like i 'm some kind of UNknown
they all want something from me that i can 't give them
what 's that ?
it ain 't as bad as it seems and i can 't
i 'm beginning to feel like moses without a burning bush
he was still moses
why doyou believe in all this death stuff ?
i mean i went through it and i 'm not so sure
you never did and you 'r e totally convinced
what 's in it for you raymond ?
i have my reasons
i ain 't buying that
got to be more to it than that raymond
i want to believe that death isn 't just UNknown
isn 't that what everyone wants ?
that there 's just
maybe more important have them see you and know
know how much you miss them
you lose someone
i 'm calling it quits
i 'm going home
you know i 'm losing her and i don 't even know what for
at this point but we do know
that the UNknown plant is one of the soviet union 's largest
UNknown of four UNknown
it 's a matter of time those old plants
the UNknown plant is located in the settlement of UNknown ten miles northeast of the city of UNknown in the soviet ukrainian republic
it is a desolate area and in fact
UNknown literally UNknown means UNknown a wild scrub plant that grows UNknown in the area
yeah we UNknown e been traveling a lot
there 's a minister outside mama
do you want to see him ?
no i do not
and they think they 'r e going to comfort me ?
aw you 'r e the best mama
i 'm not going to go anyplace
now don 't you worry sweetheart
you 'r e going home
back to a place you UNknown e forgotten all about
the most beautiful place you ever dreamed of
where there 's no fear no pain no heartache
you mean that little dark haired girl ?
you know who that is ?
that 's marion my little sister
she passed on when she was only 15
she used to follow me UNknown
i just couldn 't get rid of her
now what do you suppose she 's doing here ?
i don 't know mama
why don 't you go to her ?
go to your sister mama
i suppose i should thank you
but sometimes i wish that UNknown had never met you
where you been ?
you coming in ?
well how about helping me say good bye ?
want some company ?
they 'r e all at the funeral
that 's real nice
well you look hungry to me
why don 't you get in ?
come on i ain 't going to bite you
what about this UNknown here ?
he ain 't half as dangerous as he looks
come on get in
got any egg rolls ?
come on take two
come on eat up
how you feeling ?
check mail and you tell me
it 's from people needing help
it isn 't fair to me
i never see you anymore
you 'r e never here
i 'm here
or your interview but you are never here danny
maybe i 'm being selfish for wanting you all to myself when you could be out helping other people but i loved you before any of them did
i loved you when no one else did
what do you see for us ?
what 's in our future ?
you got to say something
you just got to
come on baby
i 'm sorry
is there a tunnel of light ?
please sign my shirt
i love you UNknown
i love you too but i
a woman ?
all will be forgiven
all will be well ?
but you have to have faith
you don 't know what faith is
faith is being here
that 's faith
keep the five dollars
i talked to a psychic today and she told me everything is going to be fine
she said we 'r e going to work everything out
isn 't that something ?
that so ?
if that 's what you got to do
let 's go hit the casino
how you doing ?
you got e s p
and all that crap ?

i 'm going to do you one better
i 'm going to teach you
how to use the power yourself without me
aw man that 's bull
you want some money ?
you want a wad of cash to choke a horse ?
only catch is this using e s p to gamble it 's sort of like cheating
know what i mean ?
and you win say a hundred 200 000
what you got to understand is that
when you die
i thought i might see you again
come on in
because i wanted to be free
i wanted to just go to sleep
and have UNknown UNknown
i was dead for over ten minutes
you were there
i went to hell
and ripped my skin and i never died
i felt all of it
i couldn 't even escape in death
oh honey death is not an escape
it 's a reward and it chooses you when the time is right
i don 't know
does she love you ?
now you go on
don 't hurt me man
i ain 't going to hurt you
i 'm going to kill you
don 't let me do it

i 'm going to take a walk think a while
are you okay sir ?
this is a compound fracture
how long have you had this ?
i don 't know
i didn 't get around to it
what has that got to do with anything ?
because it is badly infected and the infection has spread and damaged your heart
my heart ?
you 'r e fast approaching cardiac arrest UNknown
i 'm afraid you 'r e going to need surgery
what is it ?
just leave it over there
we UNknown l give UNknown some time to think about it
i ain 't going to change my mind doc
i ain 't going to change my mind
doctor raymond moody
i heard that people who have died aren 't afraid to do it again
it 's my time raymond
i 'm going back
no way ray
didn 't you say you 'r e supposed to let death choose you ?
the chances of you dying on that table in there are pretty damn good anyway
if you don 't die maybe you got some work left to do
the world 's a better place with you in it UNknown
i 'm going to be putting you under
don 't worry about a thing
i 'm not worried
who you are is a difference that love makes
i 'm so proud of you danny

and had open heart surgery
you think i 'm afraid of a UNknown ?
you bet on me
i was just kidding
i died on that table
you won that money fair and square
but you didn 't
ain 't no rest for the weary
all right there you go
i help people with the last five minutes
when the end comes everybody wants five more minutes
they want to say things left UNknown
they want to maybe love one more time
and i 'm able to give them those five minutes
then i let them go

isn 't it fate ?
so just let it be !
what did you say ?
queen mother i want to show you how i walk

it 's so funny !
are you obsessed ?
watch my finger stance !
still missing something !
please don 't bother me from practicing
what are you practicing
look at you !
so let 's forget all those practicing and tonight we will
i don 't care what you are thinking and talking
anyway stop saying anything nonsense to me
your majesty !
let me tell you one more time
i want to practice hard
in order to acquire enough power to protect the citizens of our kingdom
i want to stop crimes
i want to keep the peace of the universe
however in order to acquire super power
i must be a virgin
my ultimate mission is to save the world !
i was appointed as the scholar at last !
your dad is the senior official now you won the glory for the family !
auntie you 'r e right !
where is dad now ?
your father just made me angry !
he wants to give you hard time with some outsiders
auntie what is it about ?
without your consent he agreed to marry you with someone before your birth
now he wants you to marry a thin and UNknown beggar
we UNknown l have double happiness if you get married soon
dad marriage is a serious issue
i have already in love with someone
you have got a lover ?
that 's wonderful !
well you go in there give her a glance
then tell her that you won 't marry her
for the rest i UNknown l fix it for you
thank you my dear auntie
what is your lover ?
how did you meet her ?
i wanted to buy a bag for carrying my reference books
it 's fate that made me meet her
she is so pretty i am fascinated
my heart beat fast i just couldn 't control myself
this bag costs 20 taels
i offer is 30 taels
what are you looking ?
don 't you think it doesn 't look good on me ?
my offer is 50 taels
my offer is 60 taels
shopping here you shouldn 't care the price
as long as you buy something you like
i want this bag no matter what price it is
please take it
but she didn 't take that bag
and this bag became the pledge of our love
we agreed that on the day i was appointed the scholar our love story would be continued
is she stupid or innocent ?
if i were her i would have taken the bag away for re sale
no matter what i want to marry her
what a pity that she didn 't appear as promised
perhaps she fell for another gentleman
we fell in love at the first sight
i would suicide for love if our love story fails to continue
my dear son don 't be silly !
tell me her name
her name sounds as good as her voice
her name is nightingale
hey come on
come here please this is your UNknown e
my daughter nightingale
hey do you want to dump my girl ?
in that case it will be shameless of her to marry another guy !
wu fa da !
bro million !
okay you can blame me of breaking the promise
i UNknown l pay your loss with money okay ?
since we are friends let 's not bargain
step aside it 's dangerous !
dear better be smart
she is sweet and pretty many guys want to woo her
but she knows she must marry him but no one else
when she arrived you refused to marry her
no matter what i said you have enough excuses to reject her
in order to compensate her broken heart you are requested to pay us one million taels
i can rap too
i can hear nothing about your request
i would like to offer what i want to offer
if you want to mess up you UNknown l get no penny at all
she is worth nothing !
she stammers which makes me laugh and tease
i don 't see any good of her
so i would only offer you a UNknown as compensation
i offer a million and you counter offer one UNknown ?
you 'r e not sincere enough
this is so called bargain !
take it or leave it
you counter offer with your poisoned lips
and this isn 't a reasonable bargain at all
you must be reasonable
i won 't pay cause she is not worth
i think i am wasting my time to bargain with you
i don 't want to waste my time anymore
i UNknown l give you one more UNknown then disappear right now !
preserved bean UNknown ?
miss said that you might become our in law the day before
but today you have become a jinx
so we won 't serve you good meal anymore
so let 's wait and see your reply !
auntie why are you addicted in such game ?
have you found your miss right ?
i just lost her
i want big eyes and high nose
and good figure of course
don 't you show others your real look ?
playing UNknown love for long time is no fun !
who knows what is true or false ?
no one cares about it at all
who said so ?
we almost reached a stage of dating
he looks smart !
i sent out a pigeon for dating
but that bird didn 't return
it smells good
you killed my jackie chan and donnie yen !
i see you like that don 't you ?
well this is for you too
you killed my chow yun fat i wanna kill you !
don 't mess up !
don 't lose your mind !
what do you want ?

i want to kill you to revenge my friends !
auntie stay calm first
i don 't believe that you dare to move !
to hell with you !
let 's go !
so what should i greet you ?
call me mister bing
so why should we illegally UNknown here ?
if she hasn 't returned yet
we would be caught because we failed to protect the princess and caused her disappearance !
if this further causes the war between the 2 countries it would be shit !
but it 's still shit for we have no clue at all to search for the princess
let 's sneak in first just wait and see
this is no good let 's run
this is good let 's go in and get some information
this is a messy place
shouldn 't we go to the government office to get info from the cops ?

but we are here and the princess is inside
how could we do anything to the princess ?
you want to deny don 't you ?
so why do you dress in black at night ?
i can tell there is conspiracy
but according to the laws of hua tien is it not allowed to dress in black at night ?
isn 't there conspiracy ?
but according to the laws of hua tien can one walk in the royal garden in black and look tough ?
have a walk ?
dress in black and bustle fight in my royal garden
stop denying i witnessed that !
sweetie you talk back again and again you 'r e giving me a hard time
just give me face forget this incident okay ?
please let us go !
okay since you voice out
now i am going to issue 2 more laws
no one is allowed to dress in black late at night
you 'r e wise your majesty !
and no one is allowed to dress in black at night to fight in my royal garden !
you 'r e really wise !
okay tow them out for execution except you !
your majesty !
so is she my mom ?
my girl you 'r e alive !
do you have 2 daughters ?
dad dad !
but your dad has got beard and scar
when does he have a son ?
who is the princess ?
yes she is your sister !
she is his daughter why is she my sister ?
she isn 't my blood daughter !
damn it !
you send your daughter here to pretend as the princess and then send a non blood daughter to disguise as the prince
and you trash !
and you claim that you 'r e not UNknown as yourself !
do you want to UNknown my kingdom ?
i am innocent your majesty !
damn it !
i UNknown l then give you UNknown a trial
how dare you want to UNknown my kingdom !
it 's not harsh enough to beat you 50 times
speak up !
i want her to substitute her and live a happy life but we met her and messed up my plan
and she gave me her first kiss
hey it seems that it is my fault
men come here give him 500 000 tales
thank you your majesty !
well this is just a misunderstanding
UNknown jin loves this girl so i stopped him to sell his girl
UNknown jin would sacrifice his life for the girl
so i just want to save her
love who can say it 's right or wrong ?
your majesty !
let 's finish the trial first
i am sorry
love is great !
why do you want to marry the princess ?
i did everything for nightingale
nightingale is the princess so i want to kidnap her
if she is the queen then i UNknown l kidnap the queen
you promise !
do you know it 's a crime to pretend as the princess ?
UNknown jin and i are in love
i lost my mind and wanted to commit suicide
but he saved my life
then you grabbed me here and forced me to be the princess
why didn 't you deny ?
i did but you just didn 't trust me
since the empress dowager is missing badly the princess
so i am forced to pretend
you are filial to a granny whom you don 't know at all
you can tell it is a conspiracy !
from this angle you 'r e guilty !
bang what would you like to say ?
your majesty my name is bing
i am the general in central china
pearl and i have fallen in love for ages
on the way home
how did you meet your waterloo ?
i am sure you 'r e lying !
your majesty as what you have heard
i am most suspicious
however in order to meet pearl again
i must join the competition
but out of my expectation that
my first rival is pearl !
well isn 't it coincidence ?
what a coincidence !
it 's true your majesty !
are you my sister ?
i don 't know
no wonder she failed to recognize me !
she lost her memory !
don 't tell me this old trick !
we are just wasting time to get nothing here
i just want someone to be the scapegoat now
but i love my citizens most
okay let 's kill an UNknown !
but i have just figured out something
i am not the most suspicious guy
why do you want to kill me ?
you failed to protect the princess
and you illegal UNknown into my kingdom
and you intended to rape the girl who lost memory !
also you disturbed me from sleeping
you just deserve death
pearl i am bing
don 't you take me as your sister ?
how dare you kill my boyfriend ?
are you insane or have you just lost memory ?
do you think you are my sister ?
in central china who mailed you the secret scroll for the stance of quick steps ?
how dare you claim me of a fake ?
everyone knows i am crazy for kung fu
it can 't prove that you 'r e my sister
you guys look sneaky !
i won 't be cheated by you guys !
tow him out for execution !
i order you to stop !
let him go !
queen mother !
it 's a mark for me to recognize her
now a family re union makes everyone happy !
get this general out for execution now
then let 's call it a day !
stop it !
and he caused this mess !
your majesty !
it 's not suitable to let her view such violent scene
for the sake of her health
how about celebration ?
i UNknown l forgive all of you
and i would like to make the royal match for you
and my fake sister
thank you your majesty
objection your majesty !
actually i have been in love with someone else

supposedly UNknown knows it but everyone has been there already
they just don 't remember
i am sure i haven 't been there so far
my name is karl heinz
the people have no idea how beautiful UNknown can be
because they always want to go to this one rock
i have been a couple of times there but each time on another rock foundation
last time two years ago i came with the post boat
where are you going by the way ?
ah the lake UNknown
i spent a couple of UNknown there

well i guess that is not going to happen anymore
you should be more picky with your UNknown
have you really been so often in UNknown ?
is it really so UNknown there ? yes and i always take the plane
and while you mess UNknown criminals in the train i sit already on th UNknown and fish
on the other hand on UNknown rom you can find all european connections even the smallest side tracks are registered
well well mr UNknown der
and now tell me please the fastest connection to UNknown
you have to understand the system
the UNknown on UNknown are especially easy UNknown for non experts
and not always is the shortest connection the fastest
that depends absolutely on the train connection
do you understand if you go for example from stockholm through northern sweden then
i need to change in UNknown
but before they could UNknown him back to hamburg he escaped
are they mad ?
i am glad to see you
but i would need UNknown still
and then the snow comes and the sun goes lower and lower
and you grow more and more silent
and then comes the time without switch
you mean when it 's light all day and night ?
no the UNknown darkness
that is hard for the soul
is that in UNknown too ?
UNknown UNknown is the end of the world
thats where you wanted to go on the shortest way
such a hurry ?
do you have an appointment ?
well yes i participate in a competition
in UNknown !
the first price for the best timetable expert
and when are you the best ?

about what do you dream ? dream ?
well first to win the competition
maybe you can make a job out of it
railway expert railway expert in the UNknown
you want to save all europeans time ?
yes exactly that 's the point to save time
a commission in UNknown developed a european high speed track
ice UNknown UNknown from london to naples from athens to stockholm from UNknown til UNknown
but the system isn 't good one could improve it a lot
i could come up with a much better concept
i got an absolutely new idea !
and you ?
about a rose farm in UNknown UNknown
and why exactly roses ?
they are beautiful
my grandma cared always so much about her roses
already then i had the dream to grow roses when i am grown up
and now i want that we take over the farm of my grand parents
should we have breakfast together tomorrow ?
in the cafeteria about 7 UNknown ?
the assistant took a room on UNknown
but she didn 't book it in advance
oh here we have it
what ? !
could you UNknown explain me what you are doing there ?
harry now it 's obvious the train UNknown UNknown to finland is shit
you have to stay in UNknown over night
hannes wouldn 't to that
stefan i don 't quite understand
harry hannes knows the fastest connections
the fastest connection to northern finland is to take the ship in stockholm
that 's why he takes the ship
and at the UNknown border tomorrow morning i UNknown l have him arrested
you mean we should to our UNknown work mates send a UNknown
i am sorry
to where ?
i UNknown l invite you yes you shall be my guest from now on
i don 't know
maybe someone else has
stefan i am trying to UNknown what UNknown and you

do you understand ?

stefan we are in the murder department
and the train ticket from UNknown to northern finland
i am sorry but i have UNknown 13 UNknown 6 and that is here
the mistake will probably be solved soon i would ask the conductor
i UNknown in seven weeks
here you go
still is it long way from smiling to tenderness
good luck UNknown
do you know the holy island UNknown ?
my grandma did tell about it when i was a child
if a young UNknown boy wanted to marry he had before to spend seven days on the island alone
he was not allowed to take any food along
he should proof that he could feed a family
and the woman didn 't need to proof anything ?
on the seventh day the woman had to get to the island unnoticed by the man
with cooked chicken
for their first kiss the had to stand on the highest top of the mountain
on the very top all alone
is the story true ?
i don 't know
can we see the mountain from here ?

i want to be alone
it 's new york ; mr UNknown

how wonderful to be able to give what you don 't have
miracle of empty hands
never mind the answer is UNknown
look around you
loves life ?
now happiness is UNknown daily and they 'r e miserable

water UNknown UNknown
i knew a UNknown favrini

why is he not accustomed to deceit a bit more UNknown against mishap ?
it 's prosperity he can 't handle as if he 'd had his fill of it
what UNknown l i do ?
admire nature !
elena wants to be conquered in her own eyes
she recognized long ago that her nature was destructive
but no one has ever conquered her
no man was ever equal to it ; least of all me
and another thing sex is only an accessory
i need my book
i UNknown l get it
it means happiness
no one ever told me
glass of milk
what UNknown l i do ?
admire the architecture
women 's UNknown bent for nest building
this confidence in an amorous destiny
UNknown not words
nothing to do with economy or industry something much more remote
this calm UNknown faith in personal happiness as their rightful due making them UNknown themselves wings spread wide into unknown and empty space where no shore is visible
i don 't believe in sin
the thing is to arouse them without looking like a UNknown
you may go cecile
imbeciles are like doors
why kiss my hand ?
i 'm just a son of a bitch
my love my love it matters not that i am born
you become visible at the place where i am no more
hound of the baskervilles
at night you UNknown l reproach me for my faults one by one
thank you for accepting
say no more
thank you for accepting
read jules renard darling
or deserts to the enemy
who 's the enemy miss parker ?
like eating a sandwich during a show or an apple
it 's possible
my pleasure miss
with 3 percent you can think but not tell
it wasn 't in the papers
elena or raoul made it up
i never read
let people in books make things up
read about us
but minus UNknown and pussy
that 's why above all it UNknown love
it 's a key to UNknown
i have to talk to you
UNknown when will he learn grammar ?
let passion UNknown us
a berth on the nile
ideal for a racing pulse
we really must talk
the contessa has the draft agreement ?
i UNknown l ask mr UNknown
check it miss UNknown
now dorothy can trade in her jaguar
what can we say with 3 percent ?
her blouse lightly shakes as if she was UNknown poison
amazing the crowd around you when you think you 'r e alone with your man
people you don 't suspect
your ex lovers
others he doesn 't suspect
your future lovers
we 'r e poor !
UNknown will i give my heart
remember it !
i UNknown l be many women
why was UNknown obsessed by
i quote the torture of an innocent child by a brute ?
yes but why first of all always why
you were always alone
the wizards of the stock exchange
raoul you coming ?
we need action !
where 's your brother ?
so far all we UNknown e done is talk
yes but let 's think it over anyway
you have an idea ?
nothing is more abstract than crime
see UNknown 's article ?
don 't break china
for me a novel starts this way
the first time i saw terry UNknown
talk about the capitalist dynamic
only balzac is allowed to write badly
it should be dynamite
love speaks only to that which is hidden in its object
so why throw them together ?
what agreement ?
you decide as you always do that i was your destiny
it 's all in the face face are for UNknown
tonight elena !
you don 't understand my silence
you talk you talk
others who exist
you only think of you
yet it 's taking a woman as she is ; free
why ask someone to change ? allowed to be herself
if i change i 'm no longer who i was
and if i 'm not that
could it be our view of the past is false since we 'r e always told about UNknown of men but never whom they gathered around
who 's talking ? because he was foreign or sick ?
women children boys unaware that these words no longer have a UNknown only an UNknown of UNknown ?
it could !
and the very UNknown of these two verbs is obscene
what 's wrong mr UNknown face ?
watch what you 'r e doing !
but what i do is by honest preference
i therefore deserve no credit and am UNknown distressed
how can i remedy that ?
i must learn to hate you and loathing in my heart to serve you since such is my duty
she is UNknown praise be
but such audacity to be a lover near to a girl betrothed
where are they ?
a woman can 't do much to ruin a man
he carries his tragedy within him
she can provoke him irritate him she can kill him
that 's all
why spend so much money for a picture of something so simple ?
i can 't tell you
it 'd be nice if for once you said something
yes but i never know what
the UNknown 's ready ?
not yet madame
what does he mean ?
ever get stung by a dead bee ?
enough laurent ; we don 't pay you for nothing
the jacket 's fine
that 's not always true
then memory is the only hell to which we 'r e condemned in all innocence
for the first time we have a chance to say things for the last time
any regrets ?
my mother said
if ever she hesitated
it 's elementary !
a woman whom you love UNknown you of other women and sometimes of love
the lake wasn 't there where it usually was
and when they UNknown it through the trees it wasn 't the same
one small word to tell us where we are ; where we 'r e going would be worth fortunes
where is he ?
alas i waste away in impotent UNknown to return to the confusion from whence i strayed
how often will i die to go on living ?
do you know the crime or by whom you are betrayed ?
hello mr UNknown
we UNknown l stay with the de UNknown
what 'r e these images ?
ever get stung by a dead bee ?
i don 't know !
i can 't swim !
so piss off
give me your hand
it 's space
let it say they have loved
the light is failing
get rid of these
this token of light this timid UNknown we will forget in the rain and deception of march
x and y of e which UNknown to a third
what 's going on ?
take the blue room counselor
what counselor ?
london new york geneva in one night
i hope the bathtub 's fixed
where 's the dollar at ?
you know something joe ?
raoul knows nothing either
men create the mystery women find the key
meaning what ?
what about me ?
check the water
UNknown get a lesson
says he 's his brother
mama accepts it ; i don 't
he talked to madame ?
they shouted all night
beat it !
i have the death certificate
okay but anything new ?
but what UNknown l i do ?
admire the furniture
you were gone
come with me
joe and i UNknown l handle our own 3 percent
we 'r e not staying
he can 't be worse than the other clown
every clown has a UNknown
we UNknown l see
light UNknown eternally when it has UNknown being and time
we say someone leads a double life
lacking guts to lead a whole one which see as double ?
we hear you 'd like to head one of our UNknown
how do you conceive the role of a UNknown ?
act as an UNknown dream as a UNknown
up to now we UNknown e UNknown it off
but it 's getting harder to cope with UNknown running out of control
central banks are puppets ; raising lending rates is just stage UNknown
except people die
there must be some long ago disaster to serve as a model today
go back to the collapse of the ancient world
what we call peace looks very like war
it 's hard to distinguish between and out and out theft ; and to determine
when a loose woman becomes a liberated one
since you know so much tell me my name
yes her name only that
press attach for UNknown UNknown kramer jones UNknown now with UNknown prince of portsmouth and duke of boulogne
calls herself della street in honor of UNknown stanley gardner
we can 't be expelled from
aren 't you going to finish ?
speaking of silence now we UNknown e bought warner 's
snow on water
what 'r e our engineers working on ?
a highly advanced project
who told him ?
when europeans send up a prayer to america
and decline ?
a garden is never finished
its pattern its colors as if it suggests its own UNknown
but if you neglect it
give us your views on what paul UNknown
actually joint stock UNknown bids for some gadget or discovery are so numerous the web is UNknown so tightly you can 't tell companies apart
let the world be without name for a moment
let things listen to themselves
in silence in their own time and their own way
and everyday life what 's that ?
the average of all our crimes
by pursuing UNknown you become UNknown and thus shake free from your daily UNknown
another UNknown i bet
when middle east air is flying again go to UNknown
della UNknown l set it up
coming raoul ?
how far it is to the angels
dorothy has friends in UNknown
we UNknown l give you addresses
2 months ago in cannes
i played tennis with a UNknown army colonel
whenever it was my serve he 'd yell
bomb it mr UNknown bomb it !
tell this one you UNknown l love him
among our vows of love was a promise never to force
a UNknown lie can be a splendid thing
well bob ?
mr robert dirty dozen aldrich you know that we can 't UNknown your name your salary
in banking what counts is a balance
that 's the problem we always face
the swiss make a cross on the tail
UNknown is stalingrad ; your loans are in rubble
in good company
and miss UNknown ?
i order you to talk mr UNknown
mr richard UNknown
where is she ?
we made a trade
miss UNknown ?
all deals are sacred
our economy alias charity and by way of this alias breaks down barriers of politics and superstition
a commentary on isaiah ; ask miss parker
weird to find the in a UNknown cellar
islam isn 't built on doubt like our civilization but on certainty
UNknown the nude without the UNknown
very UNknown ; i 'd forgotten the UNknown breasts
rather a hussy seems to me
call it hush hush and forget it
she 's looking at someone
yes really quite UNknown
she UNknown a real person
the man realizes that others had asked very little of him !
not to worry ; UNknown will pay you more than UNknown
what UNknown ?
awfully precious della
what UNknown ?
all and no more my friends and i hold 24
we UNknown e increased our efforts in the us
aristotle right ? as is our custom
we go into a country to create a market not exploit it
you 'r e through at UNknown favrini !
all bandits take others for crooks !
assuming that you never strike up acquaintance on any personal basis
in madame 's service ?
i 'm not like you mr UNknown
i lack courage
it remains for us to make the negative
madame doesn 't need me ?
goodnight mr UNknown
what isn 't resolved by love stays forever in suspense
from the UNknown
all this grass ; is it within me ?
is it grass when it 's without me ?
if no one labels it ; gives it a name what then is grass ?
your humble servant
he 's coming
summer was early this year and a bit deranged
everything UNknown at once
we forget how UNknown it is barely UNknown it ; as with a summer bound to come again we let slip many fine days
where is he ?
i UNknown l train UNknown m right
where is she ?
yes fold my pants in the dark
must i apologize ?
i 'm coming
so look at me
i wouldn 't be forced to love you
even were you not another you still would be
we UNknown l kill all that for good
from the moment i saw you
you stole my life
by delivering me from my life you stole it
the presence you chose delivers no goodbyes
you came from outside and through love installed yourself in me and
i took you in
whatever i told you
the more i UNknown l deceive you
my UNknown will ruin you
us against the world
mr UNknown will arrange it
so it was you
it 's you it 's me
i UNknown l lead
were you ?
mr richard is mr roger ?
think so jules ?
it 's not the same one
it 's another
madame is leaving
maybe famine is UNknown in this summer heat
madame 's leaving idiot
no laurent not the mercedes
i want to be alone
it 's new york ; mr UNknown
what do i say ?
if you come back tomorrow you UNknown l be tired
tomorrow the day after
you 'r e hurt
even the rich who can afford it no longer bother
the wish to keep your death to yourself is UNknown and UNknown
are you in pain ?
how wonderful to be able to give what you don 't have
miracle of empty hands
never mind the answer is UNknown
look around you
loves life ?
now happiness is UNknown daily and they 'r e miserable
they still dwell in class consciousness but no longer pay rent
where is she ?
UNknown show him your project
come on ; what 'r e you doing ?
water UNknown UNknown
i knew a UNknown favrini
that was my father
joseph UNknown what a man
he didn 't make scenes like others just did his job
so UNknown favrini industries is you
that 's the mystery of it
it 's all mine
our UNknown UNknown s offered as payment
right UNknown ?
UNknown explain your project
UNknown UNknown spark process
it doesn 't die
we can 't withdraw from others lives and yet remain ourselves
i 'm not holding you
know how to drill a hole ?
it 's all in the hole
what then ?
why is he not accustomed to deceit a bit more UNknown against mishap ?
it 's prosperity he can 't handle as if he 'd had his fill of it
what UNknown l i do ?
admire nature !
elena wants to be conquered in her own eyes
she recognized long ago that her nature was destructive
but no one has ever conquered her
no man was ever equal to it ; least of all me
and another thing sex is only an accessory
i need my book
i UNknown l get it
it means happiness
no one ever told me
glass of milk
what UNknown l i do ?
admire the architecture
women 's UNknown bent for nest building
this confidence in an amorous destiny
UNknown not words
nothing to do with economy or industry something much more remote
this calm UNknown faith in personal happiness as their rightful due making them UNknown themselves wings spread wide into unknown and empty space where no shore is visible
i don 't believe in sin
the thing is to arouse them without looking like a UNknown
you may go cecile
imbeciles are like doors
why kiss my hand ?
i 'm just a son of a bitch
my love my love it matters not that i am born
you become visible at the place where i am no more
hound of the baskervilles
at night you UNknown l reproach me for my faults one by one
thank you for accepting
say no more
thank you for accepting
read jules renard darling
or deserts to the enemy
who 's the enemy miss parker ?
like eating a sandwich during a show or an apple
it 's possible
my pleasure miss
with 3 percent you can think but not tell
it wasn 't in the papers
elena or raoul made it up
i never read
let people in books make things up
read about us
but minus UNknown and pussy
that 's why above all it UNknown love
it 's a key to UNknown
i have to talk to you
UNknown when will he learn grammar ?
let passion UNknown us
a berth on the nile
ideal for a racing pulse
we really must talk
the contessa has the draft agreement ?
i UNknown l ask mr UNknown
check it miss UNknown
now dorothy can trade in her jaguar
what can we say with 3 percent ?
her blouse lightly shakes as if she was UNknown poison
amazing the crowd around you when you think you 'r e alone with your man
people you don 't suspect
your ex lovers
others he doesn 't suspect
your future lovers
we 'r e poor !
UNknown will i give my heart
remember it !
i UNknown l be many women
why was UNknown obsessed by
i quote the torture of an innocent child by a brute ?
yes but why first of all always why
you were always alone
the wizards of the stock exchange
raoul you coming ?
we need action !
where 's your brother ?
so far all we UNknown e done is talk
yes but let 's think it over anyway
you have an idea ?
nothing is more abstract than crime
see UNknown 's article ?
don 't break china
for me a novel starts this way
the first time i saw terry UNknown
talk about the capitalist dynamic
only balzac is allowed to write badly
it should be dynamite
love speaks only to that which is hidden in its object
so why throw them together ?
what agreement ?
you decide as you always do that i was your destiny
it 's all in the face face are for UNknown
tonight elena !
you don 't understand my silence
you talk you talk
others who exist
you only think of you
yet it 's taking a woman as she is ; free
why ask someone to change ? allowed to be herself
if i change i 'm no longer who i was
and if i 'm not that
could it be our view of the past is false since we 'r e always told about UNknown of men but never whom they gathered around
who 's talking ? because he was foreign or sick ?
women children boys unaware that these words no longer have a UNknown only an UNknown of UNknown ?
it could !
and the very UNknown of these two verbs is obscene
what 's wrong mr UNknown face ?
watch what you 'r e doing !
but what i do is by honest preference
i therefore deserve no credit and am UNknown distressed
how can i remedy that ?
i must learn to hate you and loathing in my heart to serve you since such is my duty
she is UNknown praise be
but such audacity to be a lover near to a girl betrothed
where are they ?
a woman can 't do much to ruin a man
he carries his tragedy within him
she can provoke him irritate him she can kill him
that 's all
why spend so much money for a picture of something so simple ?
i can 't tell you
it 'd be nice if for once you said something
yes but i never know what
the UNknown 's ready ?
not yet madame
what does he mean ?
ever get stung by a dead bee ?
enough laurent ; we don 't pay you for nothing
the jacket 's fine
that 's not always true
then memory is the only hell to which we 'r e condemned in all innocence
for the first time we have a chance to say things for the last time
any regrets ?
my mother said
if ever she hesitated
it 's elementary !
a woman whom you love UNknown you of other women and sometimes of love
the lake wasn 't there where it usually was
and when they UNknown it through the trees it wasn 't the same
one small word to tell us where we are ; where we 'r e going would be worth fortunes
where is he ?
alas i waste away in impotent UNknown to return to the confusion from whence i strayed
how often will i die to go on living ?
do you know the crime or by whom you are betrayed ?
hello mr UNknown
we UNknown l stay with the de UNknown
what 'r e these images ?
ever get stung by a dead bee ?
i don 't know !
i can 't swim !
so piss off
give me your hand
it 's space
let it say they have loved
the light is failing
get rid of these
this token of light this timid UNknown we will forget in the rain and deception of march
x and y of e which UNknown to a third
what 's going on ?
take the blue room counselor
what counselor ?
london new york geneva in one night
i hope the bathtub 's fixed
where 's the dollar at ?
you know something joe ?
raoul knows nothing either
men create the mystery women find the key
meaning what ?
what about me ?
check the water
UNknown get a lesson
says he 's his brother
mama accepts it ; i don 't
he talked to madame ?
they shouted all night
beat it !
i have the death certificate
okay but anything new ?
but what UNknown l i do ?
admire the furniture
you were gone
come with me
joe and i UNknown l handle our own 3 percent
we 'r e not staying
he can 't be worse than the other clown
every clown has a UNknown
we UNknown l see
light UNknown eternally when it has UNknown being and time
we say someone leads a double life
lacking guts to lead a whole one which see as double ?
we hear you 'd like to head one of our UNknown
how do you conceive the role of a UNknown ?
act as an UNknown dream as a UNknown
up to now we UNknown e UNknown it off
but it 's getting harder to cope with UNknown running out of control
central banks are puppets ; raising lending rates is just stage UNknown
except people die
there must be some long ago disaster to serve as a model today
go back to the collapse of the ancient world
what we call peace looks very like war
it 's hard to distinguish between and out and out theft ; and to determine
when a loose woman becomes a liberated one
since you know so much tell me my name
yes her name only that
press attach for UNknown UNknown kramer jones UNknown now with UNknown prince of portsmouth and duke of boulogne
calls herself della street in honor of UNknown stanley gardner
we can 't be expelled from
aren 't you going to finish ?
speaking of silence now we UNknown e bought warner 's
snow on water
what 'r e our engineers working on ?
a highly advanced project
who told him ?
when europeans send up a prayer to america
and decline ?
a garden is never finished
its pattern its colors as if it suggests its own UNknown
but if you neglect it
give us your views on what paul UNknown
actually joint stock UNknown bids for some gadget or discovery are so numerous the web is UNknown so tightly you can 't tell companies apart
let the world be without name for a moment
let things listen to themselves
in silence in their own time and their own way
and everyday life what 's that ?
the average of all our crimes
by pursuing UNknown you become UNknown and thus shake free from your daily UNknown
another UNknown i bet
when middle east air is flying again go to UNknown
della UNknown l set it up
coming raoul ?
how far it is to the angels
dorothy has friends in UNknown
we UNknown l give you addresses
2 months ago in cannes
i played tennis with a UNknown army colonel
whenever it was my serve he 'd yell
bomb it mr UNknown bomb it !
tell this one you UNknown l love him
among our vows of love was a promise never to force
a UNknown lie can be a splendid thing
well bob ?
mr robert dirty dozen aldrich you know that we can 't UNknown your name your salary
in banking what counts is a balance
that 's the problem we always face
the swiss make a cross on the tail
UNknown is stalingrad ; your loans are in rubble
in good company
and miss UNknown ?
i order you to talk mr UNknown
mr richard UNknown
where is she ?
we made a trade
miss UNknown ?
all deals are sacred
our economy alias charity and by way of this alias breaks down barriers of politics and superstition
a commentary on isaiah ; ask miss parker
weird to find the in a UNknown cellar
islam isn 't built on doubt like our civilization but on certainty

madame doesn 't need me ?
goodnight mr UNknown
what isn 't resolved by love stays forever in suspense
from the UNknown
all this grass ; is it within me ?
is it grass when it 's without me ?
if no one labels it ; gives it a name what then is grass ?
your humble servant
he 's coming
summer was early this year and a bit deranged
everything UNknown at once
we forget how UNknown it is barely UNknown it ; as with a summer bound to come again we let slip many fine days
where is he ?
i UNknown l train UNknown m right
where is she ?
yes fold my pants in the dark
must i apologize ?
i 'm coming
so look at me
i wouldn 't be forced to love you
even were you not another you still would be
we UNknown l kill all that for good

whatever i told you
the more i UNknown l deceive you
my UNknown will ruin you
us against the world
mr UNknown will arrange it
so it was you
it 's you it 's me
i UNknown l lead
were you ?
mr richard is mr roger ?
think so jules ?
it 's not the same one
it 's another
i 'm on my way
he was UNknown but he mentioned your name
i know what this is
i UNknown e seen one before
many many years ago
a man possessed of some radical notions
what is the most UNknown parasite ?
an idea that is fully formed fully understood that sticks
right in there somewhere
it 's called UNknown
the most skilled UNknown
cause i am the most skilled UNknown
i know how to search your mind and find your secrets
i know the tricks
look if you want my help you 'r e gonna have to be completely open with me
i need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife better than your UNknown better than anyone
if this is a dream and you have a safe full of secrets
i need to know what 's in that safe
in order for this all to work you need to completely let me in
enjoy your evening gentlemen
it doesn 't matter
he looked right at it when i mentioned secrets
what 's she doing here ?
just head back to the room alright
i UNknown l take care of this
okay make sure you do
we 'r e here to work
if i jump would i survive ?
a clean dive perhaps
i thought you might be missing me
you know that i am
but i can 't trust you anymore
so what ?
actually the subject is partial disposal of british painters
please have a seat
you can 't imagine
getting some fresh air
did she tell you ?
have you known all along ?
that you 'r e here to steal from me or that we are actually asleep ?
i want to know the name of your employer
there 's no use in threatening within a dream right mal ?
that depends on what you 'r e threatening
killing him will just wake him up
what are you doing ?
it 's too soon !
just try to keep saito lie a little bit longer
we 'r e almost there
wake him up !
not even my head of security knows this apartment
how did you find it ?
it 's very difficult for a man of your position to keep a love nest like this secret particularly when there 's a married woman involved
she will never
you got what you need
well it 's not true
you left out a key piece of information didn 't you ?
you held something back because you knew what we were up to
question is why do you let us in at all ?
doesn 't matter
but your dream approach is obvious
so leave me alone
the operation that hired us they won 't accept failure
we won 't last two days
tell us what you know !
tell us what you know now !
i UNknown e always hated this carpet
it stain and fade in such UNknown ways
that way you know it 's made of wool
but now a line of UNknown
which means i 'm not lying on my carpet in my apartment
you have lived after your reputation mr cobb
i 'm still dreaming
we 'r e not getting paid
dream within a dream huh
i 'm impressed
yes but you see mr saito
we 'r e not in your dream
we 'r e in mine
it wasn 't my fault
you 'r e the architect
i don 't know he 's gonna rub his damn cheek on it !
that 's enough
i have it under control
i didn 't see it under control
we don 't have time for this
i 'm getting off at kyoto
i don 't like trains
is that you james ?
yeah when are you coming home dad ?
well i can 't sweetheart
i can 't
grandma says you 'r e never coming back
UNknown is that you ?
put grandma on the phone for me will you ?
she 's shaking her head
let 's just hope she 's wrong about that
mommy 's not here anymore
and you be good you be
our ride 's on the roof
sorry about your leg it won 't happen again
it 's getting worse isn 't it ?
one apology is all you 'r e getting huh arthur
where 's nash ?
by now they know we failed
it 's time we disappear
where would you even go ?
so i offer you the satisfaction
it 's not the way i deal with things
what will you do with him ?
what do you want from us ?
okay here 's me planting an idea in your head
i say to you
what are you thinking about ?
the subject 's mind can always trace the UNknown of the idea
true inspiration 's impossible to fake
it 's not true
are you offering me a choice ?
cause i can find my own way to square things with UNknown
you don 't need to have a choice
and i choose to leave sir
tell the crew where you want to go
hey mr cobb !
to america ?
no one can !
my main competitor is an old man in poor health
his son will soon inherit control of the corporation
i need him to decide to break up his father 's empire
cobb we should walk away from this
how do i know you can deliver ?
you don 't
or become an old man filled with regrets waiting to die alone ?
assemble your team mr cobb
and choose your people more wisely
look i know how much you wanna go home
but this can 't be done
yes it can
you don 't know that
i UNknown e done it before
who 'd you do it to ?
are we going to paris ?
we 'r e gonna need a new architect
you never did like your office did you ?
no space to think in that room covered
is it safe for you to be here ?
UNknown between france and the united states is a UNknown nightmare you know that
i think they might find a way to make it work in your case
look i brought this for you to give to the kids when you have a chance
it will take more than the occasional stuffed animal to convince those children they still have a father
i 'm just doing what i know
i 'm doing what you taught me
i never taught you to be a thief
no you taught me to navigate people 's minds but after what happened
they wanna hold our legitimate ways for me to use that skill
what are you doing here UNknown ?
i think i found a way home
it 's a job for some very very powerful people
people who i believe can fix my charges permanently
but i need your help
you 'r e here to corrupt one of my brightest and best
you know what i 'm offering
you have to let them decide for themselves
things that couldn 't exist in the real world
so you want me to let someone else follow you into your fantasy
they don 't actually come in to the dream
they just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers
that 's all
come back to reality UNknown
that 's their reality
i would not be standing here if i knew any other way
i need an architect who 's as good as i was
i got somebody better
please to meet you
mr cobb has a job offer he 'd like to discuss with you
is the work pretty soon ?
you 'r e not gonna tell me anything about this first ?
before i describe the job i have to know you can do it
two minutes design a maze that it takes one minute to solve
that 's more like it
they say we only use a fraction of our brain 's true potential
now that 's when we 'r e awake
when we 'r e asleep the mind can do almost anything
such as ?
you consciously create each aspect
but sometimes it feels like it 's almost creating itself
if you know what i mean
we create and perceive our world simultaneously
and our mind does this so well that we don 't even know it 's happening
that allows us to get right into the middle of that process
now this is where i need you
you create the world of the dream
we bring the subject into that dream
and they feel it 's their subconscious
how can i ever acquire enough detail to make them think that it 's reality
well dreams they feel real while we 'r e in them right ?
it 's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange
let me ask you a question
you never really remember the beginning of a dream do you ?
you always wind up right in the middle of what 's going on
i guess yeah
well we just came from the
think about it UNknown
where are you right now ?
we 'r e dreaming ?
you 'r e actually in the middle of the workshop right now sleeping
and this is your first lesson in shared dreaming so there you go
if it 's just a dream then why are you
it 's never just a dream is it ?
when your face is full of glass feels like hell
when you 'r e in it it feels real
it 's what the military developed
during that time it was a training program for soldiers to shoot and stab and strangle each other and then wake up ?
how did UNknown think they belong ?
well someone had to design the dreams right ?
why don 't you give us another five minutes ?
five minutes ?
in a dream your mind functions more quickly therefore time seems to feel more slow
five minutes in the world gives you an hour in the dream
why don 't we see what you can get up to in five minutes ?
we got the basic layout
who are the people ?
UNknown of my subconscious
you built this world
you can literally talk to my subconscious
that 's one of the ways we extract information from a subject
how else do you do it ?
by creating something secure like a
like a bank vault or a jail
the mind automatically fills it with information it 's trying to protect
my question is what happens when you start messing with the physics of it all ?
something isn 't it ?
yes it is
cause my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world
the more you change things the quicker the UNknown start to UNknown them
they attack like white blood cells fighting an infection
are they going to attack us ?
it 's my subconscious
yeah i cross it everyday to get to the college
never recreate places from your memory
always imagine new places
only use details
never entire areas
is that what happened to you ?
listen to me
is that why you need me to build your dreams ?
get off of her
you 'r e okay
cause there were still some time on the clock and you can 't wake up within a dream unless you die
show me the UNknown
that 's some subconscious you got on you cobb !
she 's a real charmer
oh i see you met mrs cobb
she 's his wife
like a coin ?
this is a loaded die
i can 't let you touch it
that would defeat the purpose
only i know the balance and the weight of this particular loaded die
that way when you look at your UNknown
you know beyond a doubt that you 'r e not in someone else 's dream
she UNknown l be back
i UNknown e never seen anyone pick it up that quickly before
reality is not gonna be enough for her now
and when she comes back
if she comes back you 'r e gonna have her building UNknown
where are you gonna be ?
i gotta go visit UNknown
it 's UNknown 's backyard
it 's a necessary risk
there is plenty of good thieves
we don 't just need a thief
we need a UNknown
you UNknown l never know
let me get you a drink
the best in town
no it 's perfectly possible
it 's just bloody difficult
he 's good at what he does right ?
oh he 's the best
he has no imagination
let me ask you something
have you done it before ?
we tried it
but it didn 't take
you didn 't plant it deep enough ?
no it 's not just about depth
you need the simplest version of the idea in order for it to grow naturally in your subjects
mind is a very subtle art
so what is this idea that you need to plant ?
we need the heir of a major corporation to dissolve his father 's empire
well you see right there you have various political UNknown and UNknown UNknown sentiments to set forth
and with all that stuff it 's really at the mercy of your subject 's prejudice
and what you have to do is start with the absolute basic
which is what ?
do you have a chemist ?
no not yet
when are you taking me there ?
once you lost your tail
men at the bar
i don 't remember
be back here ?
stay out !
what are you doing in UNknown ?
i need to protect my investments
ah so this is your idea of losing your tail huh
i tried not to come but
but there 's nothing quite like it
it 's just pure creation
shall we take a look at some UNknown architecture ?
you 'r e gonna have to master a few tricks if you 'r e gonna build three complete dream levels
in a dream you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes
that lets you create closed UNknown
like the penrose steps
how big do these levels have to be ?
it could be anything from the floor of a building to an entire city
but they have to be complicated enough that we can hide from the projection
then the longer we have
before the UNknown catch us ?
you wait till it turns ugly
no one likes to feel someone else is messing around with their mind
cobb can 't build anymore can he ?
i don 't know if he can 't but he won 't
he thinks it 's safer if he doesn 't know the UNknown
but i think it 's mal
his ex wife ?
no she 's
what was she like in real life ?
she 's lovely
and to go into the field with us
no i rarely go into the field mr cobb
we 'd need you there to tell the UNknown specific to our needs
which are ?
two levels ?
it is possible you just had to have a sedative
well powerful sedative
there 's no room for tourists on a job like this mr saito
this time it seems there is
this i think is a good place to start
i use it everyday
perhaps you will not want to see
you see ?
three four hours each day
and the dream time ?
with this compound ?
why do they do it ?
tell him mr cobb
do you still dream mr cobb ?
they come here everyday to sleep ?
the dream has become their reality
who are you to say otherwise huh ?
let 's see what you can do
you know how to find me
you know what you have to do
sharp enough ?
what 's your problem with this mr fischer ?
that 's not your concern
mr saito this isn 't your typical corporate espionage
you asked me for UNknown
i do hope you understand the gravity of that request
the seed that we plant in this man 's mind will grow into an idea
this idea will define him
it may come to change
it may come to change everything about him
we 'r e the last company standing between them and total energy UNknown
we can no longer compete
soon they UNknown l control the energy supply of half the world
in effect they become a new UNknown
the world needs robert fischer to change his mind
that 's where we come in
how is robert fischer 's relationship with his father ?
rumor is the relationship is quite complicated
but we can 't work based solely on rumor can 't we ?
can you get me access to this man here ?
browning fischer UNknown 's right hand man
fischer jr 's godfather
references are something of a specialty for me mr saito
i 'm not smelling settlement here
take them down
shall we voice your concerns with maurice directly ?
not sure if that 's necessary
no no no
robert did i tell you to keep out of town
wait just do it
follow through !
i put it beside his bed
he hasn 't even noticed
robert we need to talk about the power of attorney
i know this is hard right now
not now uncle peter but it 's imperative that we start to
the vultures are circling
i UNknown e had ample opportunity to observe browning adopt his physical presence study his UNknown and so on and so forth
now in the first layer of the dream i can UNknown browning
and suggest UNknown to fischer 's conscious mind
then when we take him a level deeper his own projection of browning should should UNknown right back to him
so he gives himself the idea
he has to see himself generate it
UNknown i am impress
were you going out there on your own ?
i didn 't realize anyone was here
here let me take a look
so you 'r e learning huh ?
an elegant solution for keeping track of reality
was it your idea ?
no it was it 's mal 's actually
just spin and spin
how are the UNknown coming on ?
each level UNknown to the part of the subject 's subconscious that we are trying to access
so making the bottom level hospitals
so fischer will bring his father
actually i have a question about this layout
no no no
only the dreamer should know the layout
why is that so important ?
in case one of us brings in our UNknown we don 't want them knowing the details of the maze
you mean in case you bring mal in
well you can 't keep her out can you ?
which should sabotage the whole operation
cobb did the others know ?
no one said it 's getting worse
i need to get home
that 's all i care about right now
why can 't you go home ?
because they think i killed her
i UNknown l split up my father 's empire
now this is obviously an idea that robert himself will choose to reject
that 's why we need to plant it deep in the subconscious
subconscious is UNknown by emotion right ?
how do you translate a business strategy to an emotion ?
UNknown and robert two UNknown of UNknown two very UNknown types of management
that 's what we 'r e here to figure out right ?
now robert 's relationship with his father is UNknown to say the least
i can 't remember that
because suggesting him to break up his father 's company is a screw you to the old man
no cause i think positive emotion triumphs negative emotion everytime
we 'r e all hearing for a reconciliation
alright well try this
that might work
thank you for your contribution arthur
forgive me for wanting a little UNknown UNknown
when we get inside his mind we 'r e gonna have to work at what we find
on the top level we open up his relationship with his father
and the next level down we feed him with
i will create something for myself
by the time we hit the bottom level we bring out the big guns
my father doesn 't want me to be him
in other words it gives us more time on each level
brain function in the dream will be about twenty times normal
when you enter a dream within that dream the effect is UNknown
it 's three dreams that 's 10 hours that 's twenty
i 'm sorry math is never my strong subject
how much time is that ?
it 's a week the first level down
six months the second level and the third level
is ten years
depends on the dream
i 'm hoping you have something more elegant in mind than shooting me in the head
this UNknown would be a kick
it 's that feeling of falling you get the UNknown you awaken snaps you out of the dream
are we gonna feel a kick with this kind of UNknown ?
oh that 's the UNknown
i UNknown e UNknown it to leave any ear function UNknown
that way however deep the sleep the sleeper still feels falling
we can use a musical content to synchronize the different kicks
he doesn 't have any surgery scheduled no dental nothing
wasn 't he suppose to have a knee operation ?
we need we need at least a good ten hours
sydney to los angeles
he makes it every two weeks
and he must be flying private
not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane
but that should be a UNknown
why is that ?
so no one would walk through
but you 'd have to buy out the entire cabin
and the first class flight
i bought the airline
you know how to find me
you know what you have to do
do you remember when you ask me to marry you ?
of course i do
that will grow old together
and we can
i just want to see what kind of tests you 'r e doing here alone every night
whatever it was it has nothing to do with you
it has everything to do with me
you UNknown e asked me to share dreams with you
it 's the only way i can still dream
why is it so important to dream ?
in my dreams we 'r e still together
these aren 't just dreams
these are memories and you said never to use memories
i know i did
you can 't let her go
you don 't understand
oh what 's down there that you regret ?
listen i do know one thing that you need to understand about me
is this your house ?
mine and mal 's yes
where is she ?
he 's digging for something maybe a worm
that 's UNknown
right now or never cobb
then i start to panic
i realized i don 't want to regret this moment that
i need to see their faces one last time
and whatever i do i can 't change this moment
so i 'm about to call out to them and run away
if i 'm ever gonna see their faces again i UNknown e gotta get back home
the real world
my name is
what are you doing here ?
i 'm just trying to understand
how could you understand ?
do you know what it is to be a lover ?
to be half in a whole ?
you 'r e waiting for a train
a train that will take you far away
you know where you hope this train will take you
but you don 't know for sure
but it doesn 't matter
how can it not matter to you where the train will take you ?
cause we will be together
how could you bring her here UNknown ?
what is this place ?
this is the hotel suite where we should spend our anniversary
what happened here ?
please i need you stay here !
just for now !
you said we UNknown l grow old together !
i UNknown l come back for you
do you really think that that 's gonna contain her ?
it 's time
when is the funeral ?
thursday in los angeles
we should move
i promised miles no
and it doesn 't have to be me
but then you have to show arthur what i just saw
get us another seat on the plane
if i get on this plane and you don 't honor our agreement
when we land i go to jail for the rest of my life
complete the job on board
i UNknown l make one phone call from the plane
you will have no trouble getting through immigration
yes it is
welcome aboard sir
you must UNknown e dropped it
gentlemen can i have your drink ?
oh water please
the maurice fischer would you ?
yes he he was my father
well he was a very inspiring figure
i 'm sorry for your loss
you couldn 't have UNknown before you went on there
oh sorry i thought it was free
well it 's not
so you might as well drop me at my stop
i 'm afraid that this
cover him !
this wasn 't in my design
get him the back room !
what the hell
is he dying ?
the girl played a freight train
why did you put a train crossing in the middle of a downtown UNknown ?
i didn 't
let me ask you a question !
why the hell were you ambushed ?
those were not normal UNknown !
they UNknown e been trained for god 's sakes !
you 'r e right
fischer had an UNknown that teaches subconscious to defend itself
so his subconscious is UNknown
it should UNknown e shown in the research
i 'm sorry
this was your job goddamn it !
this was your responsibility !
you were meant to check fischer 's background thoroughly !
we are not prepared for this type of violence !
we have dealt with self security before !
we UNknown l be a little more careful and we 'r e gonna be fine !
this was not a part of the plan !
he 's dying for god 's sake !
now let 's put him out of his misery
no no !
what 's the matter cobb ?
don 't do that he 's in agony i 'm waking him up
no it won 't wake him up
what do you mean it won 't wake him up ?
it won 't wake him up
when we die in a dream we wake up
not from this
right so what happens when we die ?
we drop in a UNknown
are you serious ?
just raw infinite subconscious
which in our case is just you
how long can we be stuck there ?
i can 't even think about trying to escape until the UNknown is
how long yusuf ?
i don 't know
just get him upstairs
so you knew about this risk and you didn 't tell us ?
there weren 't meant to be any risk cause i didn 't know we 'd be dealing with a load of gunfire
you had no right it was the only way to go three layers deep
and you you knew about this and went along with it ?
i trusted him
he 'd done it before what with mal ?
cause that worked so good ?
it has nothing to do with it
i did what i had to do to get back to my children
so you lead us into a war zone with no way out
there is a way out
alright we continue on with the job and we do this as fast as possible and we get out using the kick
just like before
i am sitting this one out on this level boys
fischer 's security is surrounding this place as we speak
ten hours of flight time is a week at this level
that means each and every one of us will be killed
that i can guarantee
UNknown is the only way forward
i 'm insured against kidnapping for up to ten million
this should be very simple
shut up !
we need the combination
it doesn 't mean you don 't know the combination
tell us what it is
i don 't know
what 's inside ?
an hour ?
saito wasn 't supposed to be shot in the chest
we got one hour now get use something useful please
what 's that ?
why does browning say you do ?
i don 't know
you have one hour
they have someone with access to your father 's office and they 'r e trying to open his safe
but i don 't know it
yeah neither do i
no he never gave me any combination
maybe he did i mean maybe you just didn 't know it was a combination
well what then ?
we didn 't have very many meaningful experiences together
perhaps after your mother died
after my mother died you know what he told me ?
robert there 's really nothing to be said
oh well he was bad with emotion
i was eleven uncle peter
how is he doing ?
he 's in a lot of pain
when we get down to the lower levels the pain will be less intense
and if he dies ?
worst case scenario ?
cobb i will still honor the arrangement
i appreciate that saito
UNknown is gonna become your reality
you 'r e gonna be lost down there so long that you 'r e gonna become an old man
filled with regret ?
and we will be alive together again
they just want a ransom
i heard them
something for you
that 's an alternate
it splits off the UNknown business of fischer morrow
and it 'd be the end of the entire empire as we know it
destroy my whole inheritance
i just don 't know
he loved you robert
at the end he called me into his deathbed
and he could barely speak
but he took the trouble to tell me one last thing
he pulled me closer
you might have the rest of the team convinced to carry on with this job but they don 't know the truth
the truth that mal is bursting through your subconscious
and the truth that as we go deeper into fischer we 'r e also going deeper into you
and i i 'm not sure we 'r e gonna like what we find
we were working together
i kept pushing things
i wanted to go further
i just didn 't understand the concept that hours could turn into years down there
that we could get trapped so deep
that when we when wind up on the shore of our subconscious we lost side of what was real
we did that for years
we built our own world
how long were you stuck there ?
something like fifty years
it wasn 't so bad at first
feeling like gods
eventually it has became impossible for me to live like that
and what about for her ?
she has locked something away
something deep inside her
she chose to forget
well to wake up from that after after years after decades to become old souls thrown back into youth like that
i knew something was wrong with her
she just wouldn 't admit it
eventually she told me the truth
she was possessed by an idea
this one very simple idea that changed everything
that our world wasn 't real
that she needed to wake up to come back to reality that in order to get back home
we had to kill ourselves
what about your children ?
she thought they were UNknown
that our real children are waiting for us out there somewhere
look cobb !
if this is my dream why can 't i control this ?
because you don 't know you 'r e dreaming !
she was certain there was nothing i could do no matter how much i begged no matter how much i pleaded
she wanted to do it
but she could not do it alone
she loved me too much so
she came up with a plan on our anniversary
sweetheart what are you doing ?
just step back inside now come on
no i 'm not
if you jump you 'r e not gonna wake up remember ?
you 'r e gonna die
now just step back inside come on
step back inside so we can talk about this
we UNknown e talked enough
take a second and think about our children
think about james
what does that mean ?
i filed a letter with our attorney explaining how i 'm fearful for my safety
how you threatened to kill me
why did you do that ?
i love you UNknown
i UNknown e freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them
we 'r e going home
to our real children
you 'r e waiting for a train
mal goddamn it !
a train that will take you far away
james and UNknown are waiting for you !
you know where you hope this train will take you
they 'r e waiting for us !
but you can 't know for sure
mal look at me !
but it doesn 't matter
mal goddamn it !
sweetheart look at me !
mal no !
that made it impossible for me to try to explain the nature of her madness
so i ran
alright let 's go
your guilt UNknown her
but you are not responsible for the idea that destroyed her
and if we are gonna succeed in this you have to forgive yourself
you 'r e gonna have to confront her
but you don 't have to do that alone
no no you don 't
i 'm doing it for the others
because they have no idea of the risk they UNknown e taken coming down here with you
we have to move
not consciously anyway
i got somebody standing in front of his office right now ready to tap in the combination
i need the first six numbers that come to your head right now
i have no idea
right now !
you 'd have to do better than that
what more do you like ?
to kill me ?
that boy 's relationship with his father is even worse than we imagined
this helps us how ?
the stronger the issues the more powerful the UNknown
how are you gonna reconcile then pursue his UNknown ?
well i 'm working on that don 't i ?
we gotta break out of here before we 'r e totally boxed in
now we need to shift his UNknown from his father to his godfather
we 'r e gonna destroy his one positive relationship ?
no we UNknown l repair his relationship with his father by exposing his godfather 's true nature
we should thrice fischer 's loot more than saito 's mission
what about his security ?
it 's gonna get worse as we go deeper
no i think we 'r e going with mr charles
a bad UNknown
we run with mr charles like we did on this timed job
so you UNknown e done it before ?
yeah and it didn 't worked
the subject realized that he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces
i need some kind of distraction
listen to me
yeah getting down there is gonna be unstable as hell
don 't jump too soon
we only have one shot at that kick you 'r e gonna make
i UNknown l play the music and you UNknown l know it 's coming the rest is on you
are you ready ?
i was telling you my story
i guess it wasn 't to your liking
i have a lot in my mind
there goes mr charles
rod green from UNknown
she must have blown you off
that is unless her phone number really is only six UNknown
listen don 't worry about it
my people are already on it as we speak
who or what is mr charles ?
it 's a UNknown designed to turn fischer against his own subconscious
and why don 't you approve ?
cause it involves telling the mark that he 's dreaming which involves attracting a lot of attention to us
so cobb said he couldn 't do that ?
so now you UNknown e noticed how much time cobb spends doing things he says never to do
mr saito may i have a moment ?
i 'm sorry but
very amusing mr UNknown
no i mean it 's must closer
it 's yusuf 's driving
i 'm sorry who did you say you were ?
rod green from UNknown
my name is mr charles
you remember me don 't you ?
i 'm the head of your security down here
get out on a different floor and keep moving
dump the wallet
security huh ?
are you talking about UNknown ?
i am here to protect you
you 'r e not safe here
they 'r e coming for you
strange weather isn 't it ?
you feel that ?
they 'r e still looking at us
yeah it 's worth a shot
we should probably get out of here
feel that ?
pay attention to the UNknown of the weather the shifting gravity
none of this is real
you 'r e in a dream
now the easiest for you to test yourself is to try to remember how you arrived at this hotel
can you do that ?
see i don 't i
i was sent here to protect you in the event that UNknown try to pull you into a dream
and i believe that 's what 's going on right now mr fischer
right away follow me
these men were sent here to UNknown you alright
if you want my help you have to remain calm
i need you to work with me mr fischer
if this is a dream i should just kill myself to wake up right ?
i wouldn 't do that if i were you mr fischer
i believe they have you UNknown and if you pull that trigger you may not wake up
you may go into a further dream state
now you know what i 'm talking about
you remember the training
give me the gun
there was there was a lot of UNknown
and there 's rain
where were they holding you ?
they had us in the back of a van
that explains the gravity shifts
you 'r e in the back of a van right now
god why is it so hard to remember ?
it 's like trying to remember a dream after you UNknown e woken up
listen it takes years of practice
you and browning has been pulled into this dream because they 'r e trying to steal something from your mind
i need you to focus and try and remember what that is
what is it mr fischer ?
they 'r e trying to extract the number from your subconscious
it can represent anything
we should try hotel rooms
what was the number mr fischer ?
try and remember for me
this is very important
that 's good enough
no i have to judge it for myself
while you 'r e all asleep in 528 i UNknown l wait for yusuf 's kick
well how will you know ?
his music warns me
so we get a nice UNknown kick
if it 's too soon we won 't get pulled out
if it 's too late
i won 't be able to drop us
why not ?
can 't drop you without gravity
yeah i think so yeah
they were trying to put you under
i 'm already under
a dream within a dream ?
i 'm sorry
good looking fella i 'm sure
that 's fischer 's projection of browning
let 's follow him and see how he behaves
well not exactly
the kidnappers are working for you ?
so you get the alternate will ?
fischer morrow has been my entire life
i can 't let you destroy it
i 'm not gonna throw away my inheritance
why would i ?
what taunt ?
that 's his last insult
a challenge for you to build something for yourself by telling you you 'r e not worthy of his accomplishments
what that he was disappointed hmm ?
i 'm sorry
mr fischer ?
trust me it 's what i do
he 's hiding something and we need to find out what that is
i need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you
we UNknown l enter his subconscious and find out what he doesn 't want you to know
we 'r e going into fischer 's
but i told him it was browning 's so he can be a part of our team
he 's gonna help us break into his own subconscious
that 's right
and i will lead them on a merry chase
just be back here for the kick
go to sleep mr UNknown
are you good ?
i 'm ready
hopefully the truth we want fischer to learn
i mean what 's down there for you ?
did you see that ?
UNknown this is your dream
i need you to draw the security away from the complex you understand ?
who will guide fischer in ?
i designed the place
i could do it
fischer you UNknown l be going with him
the windows on that upper floor are big enough for me to cover you from that south tower
you see it ?
in order to find out the truth about your father you 'r e gonna need to break into browning 's mind on your own
come fischer !
i hope they 'r e ready
it 's too soon
first heard it about twenty minutes ago
i thought it was the wind up here
yeah i hear it
which gives arthur three minutes
they still have to climb down to the middle terrace
well then they need a new route
a more direct route
there must be access where we can cut through the maze right ?
i don 't think i should tell you
if mal finds out
did he add any ?
he added an air UNknown system that can cut through the maze
yeah we missed it
what the hell do we do now ?
we finish the job before the next kick
what next kick ?
arthur has a couple of minutes we have about twenty
are you okay ?
just buy us some more time alright ?
come on !
was it stronger if it have any windows ?
no i mean it wouldn 't be very strong if it did
let 's hope fischer likes what he finds in there
are those UNknown part of his subconscious ?
we 'r e here
there 's an entire army headed your way
we 'r e in
fischer it 's a trap get out !
how do you know that ?
she is just a projection
fischer fischer is real !
what happened ?
but there 's no use in UNknown him his mind 's already trapped down there
it 's all over
then we failed ?
it 's a shame i really want to know what 's gonna happen in there
i swear we have this one
let 's set the charges
no there 's still another way
we just have to follow fischer down there
we don 't have time
no but there will be enough time down there
and we will find him
okay as soon as arthur 's music kicks in just use the UNknown to revive him
we can give him his own kick down below
look you get him in there
as soon as the music ends you blow up the hospital
and we all ride the kick back up the layers
that 's worth a shot
and saito can hold the guards out while i set the charges
saito will never make it will he ?
cobb come on !
let 's go !
she 's right
i mean mal 's gonna be down there
i know where to find her
she UNknown l have fischer
how do you know ?
she wants me to come after her she wants me back down there with her
are you alright ?
no room for tourists on this jobs
don 't be silly
this is incredible
that was our first apartment and we moved to that building right there
after mal became pregnant that became our home
you UNknown all of these from memory ?
like i told you we have lots of time
what is that ?
will she be in there ?
in the real world we 'd have to choose but not here
how are you gonna bring fischer back ?
i 'm gonna have to come up with some kind of a kick
it can grown to define or destroy you
the smallest idea such as
your world is not real
simple little thought that changes everything
so certain of your world
of what 's real ?
do you think he is ?
why do you think he 's as lost as i was ?
i know it 's real mal
no creeping doubts ?
chased around the globe by anonymous UNknown and police forces ?
the way the UNknown UNknown the dreamer ?
because you left us
yes but i want to see them up above mal
up above ?
those aren 't my children
you keep telling yourself that but you don 't believe it
no i know it
what if i 'm what 's real ?
you keep telling yourself what you know
but what do you believe ?
what do you feel ?
what truth ?
you planted the idea in my mind ?
what is she talking about ?
the reason i knew UNknown was possible was because i did it to her first
i did it to my own wife
i knew we needed to escape but she wouldn 't accept it
she had locked something away something deep inside
the truth that she had once known but she chose to forget
she couldn 't break free
so i decided to search for it
going deep into the recess of her mind and found that secret place
i broke in and i planted an idea
a simple idea that i knew would change everything
that her world wasn 't real
that death was the only escape
you 'r e waiting for a train
a train that will take you far away
you know where you hope this train will take you
but you can 't know for sure !
and it doesn 't matter !
now tell me why !
because we UNknown l be together
mal no !
i was trying to save you
you betrayed me but you can make amends
you can still keep your promise
we can still be together right here
in the world we built together
cobb we need to get fischer
you can 't have him
if i stay here will you let him go ?
what are you talking about ?
fischer 's on the porch
go check if he 's alive UNknown
cobb you can 't do this
go check if he 's alive right now !
take fischer with you alright ?
you can 't stay here to be with her !
i 'm not
that means i have to find him
i can 't stay with her anymore because she doesn 't exist
i 'm the only thing you do believe in anymore
all your perfection
you 'r e just a shade of my real wife
and you are the best that i could do but i 'm sorry you 'r e just not good enough
this will feel real ?
what are you doing ?
go go go !
i couldn 't be you
no no no !
come on come on come on !
last wlll and testament
you have to go now !
don 't lose yourself !
find saito and bring him back !
i will !
but we did
i 'd miss you more than i can bear but we had our time together
and i have to let you go
i have to let you go
i 'm sorry robert
not just to live for him
that 's what i 'm gonna do uncle peter
what happened ?
no he UNknown l be alright
are you going to kill me ?
i 'm waiting for someone
someone from a half remembered dream
i 'm an old man
filled with regret
i UNknown e come back for you
to remind you of something
something you once knew
to convince me to honor our arrangement ?
to take a leap of faith yes
come back so we can be young man together again
come back with me

the baby is due soon and she needs somebody to help her with the cooking during this time
UNknown and jacinto are already helping out
let 's give them a big hand
so UNknown has anybody volunteered ?
here 's one !
she 's very quiet
we like them when they are this pretty
always a charmer
she 's a hard worker and great in the kitchen
you UNknown l be very happy with her
what do you say father ?
you must be relieved
that man isn 't here taking pictures
and he didn 't buy the paper today
i can tell you 'r e very well informed
i 'm not one to judge
but you know about him ; he 's a bad example for the kids
i don 't find the painter to be a bad person
i mean he gave me a candle at the market
can you believe what she told me ?
oh i like him
can you believe it ?
they are best friends now
i don 't like that man at all
always taking pictures always quiet looking
i hope he goes back to where he came from
they said he came to paint ; i haven 't seen one painting so far
i 'm sure they kicked him out of his house
you know why right ?
and he had no choice but to come here
you think the painter is ?
of course !
what a pity !
you 'r e stopping me sleeping
you 'r e sweating
what are you doing here ?
you can see me ?

are you crazy ?
come on i know where we can go
the body of christ
i UNknown l go see if miguel needs help
UNknown i haven 't said a word
it was probably jacinto who spread the gossip
what gossip ?
i don 't know
why are you asking me ?
i 'm here right ?
you don 't have to
it 's not me
i never talked to that fag !
maybe he took your photo
you don 't believe me do you ?
you don 't believe me ? !
i don 't know miguel
they saw you walking out of his house
that 's a fucking lie !
but chino you have a wife
you have to respect her so that others respect her
you 'r e going to be a father
you UNknown l have a son
everybody 's telling me you 'r e fucking that guy
even the women are saying it and it bothers me

there are a thousand ways to be a man
and you are none of them !
you think you are a man ?
who are you trying to fool man ?
you 'r e afraid to accept that you love me
i can 't love you UNknown
it 's not right
and they behave like this
making up lies
that bitch !
why didn 't you send them all to hell ?
i wouldn 't cry in front of them
it 's getting huge

i UNknown l apologise to him
i UNknown l come home early
what about that painting ?
i don 't know if it 's true
i haven 't posed for that guy i swear
why do they say you two
who knows ?
nothing happened !
if your foot should cause you to sin cut it off
it 's better to enter into life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into hell
miguel what 's wrong ?
it 's that
forgive me mari
nothing happened !
i 'm sick of your swearing !
what is it ?
i found your body
and now it 's gone

don 't call me any more
don 't look for me any more
promise me you UNknown l let me rest
she doesn 't want to see you miguel
how 's UNknown doing ?
he 's a saint
it doesn 't matter how long i UNknown l wait for her
go home boy
i UNknown e got nothing to think about
i want to be with you
you won 't believe me but it 's true
what do you want me to do ?
what would you do ?
i 'd never do that
i didn 't think you would either
i just want him to be okay
i swear i UNknown l take your eyes out
have a nice day
what happened ?
you UNknown l have to wait
i gotta pee
it wasn 't a sea lion
it was the body of a man
his face was almost gone but they are sure it is the painter
father juan already blessed his body and he 's trying to find his family
they took it to the doctor 's office
it UNknown l stay there until they come to claim it
why are you telling me this ?
because if i don 't tell you nobody else will
i thought you might want to know
well now i know
it 's the ocean
you see how beautiful it is ?
but do you know who 's more beautiful ?
yes i know
and he didn 't cry ?
he never cries with you
i 'm going to get jealous
you must be hungry
they found his body
i want to bury him mari
father juan took care of him
his family is arriving tomorrow to take him
he didn 't give a fuck about our traditions
he wouldn 't have wanted
yes he wants it
do you think they UNknown l let you bury their rich kid here ?
i UNknown l try
what about UNknown ?
i 'm doing it because of him
don 't be so selfish
yes so that he can have a father he can respect
how can i teach him to be a man if i 'm not one ?
he won 't know !
let them take him
i will remember
mari it 's the last thing i swear
you 'r e swearing again
do whatever you want
where will you go ?
i UNknown l see
you still love him don 't you ?
i UNknown l be with you soon
very soon i promise
i want to offer it
you still have it right ?
they UNknown e come to take it away
then they UNknown l take him away
what the fuck do you know ?
his painting improved a lot here don 't you think ?
i don 't know
he was very protective of his paintings
but you posed for him right ?
i swear i never posed
don 't worry miguel
he called me to tell me he was with somebody
i didn 't say anything
i didn 't even ask him your name
i didn 't know what to tell him
so i pretended i hadn 't heard him
after that he never told me anything else about you
he called me like always of course but
he never talked like before
he said he painted because of you
that you had given him UNknown
not for me for santiago
he wanted to be buried here in the ocean
i UNknown e come to ask for your permission
thank you miguel but we will bury him next to his father
but you know he loved it here
i 'm sure he wouldn 't wanted you to keep it
thank you for coming
and she 's taking our son with her
she 's leaving me because i 'm here asking you to let me keep the promise i made your son
santiago wanted to be buried here if i don 't do it he won 't rest
do you realise what you 'r e asking ?
you know it isn 't me who 's asking
i want you to support him and give him company
are you sure ?
i miguel UNknown stand before my church and community to give proper burial to the lifeless body of santiago la rosa
may this ceremony please our lord and may he have mercy on santiago
so that as we take care of his body
he may take care of his soul and ensure that it may never wander without rest but find eternal peace in his glory
to my parents
mind your work !
whatever you 'r e doing it 's not gonna work
it 's too late i 'm afraid
i 'm tired
we UNknown e talked this over a hundred times
you don 't need to do this
you 'r e educated a good drawer
you 'r e not in for long
yo draw me some pussy !
you can use the time
once you 'r e out the world 's yours
you want me to be like them ?
a pathological UNknown
what 's up ?
maybe escape is a bad idea ?
you UNknown l have to hide
you can 't just buy a flat
they UNknown l find you everywhere mexico spain unless you hide in UNknown or the amazon jungle
and you ?
you should UNknown e testified
i UNknown l handle it myself
you know the code of honor ?
ok set it up
every day give one pack to my guy
not much huh ?
just don 't weep
that 's what really matters now

you don 't want me here ?
we can hug
want me to buy you something ?
i have everything i need
the lawyer says that the new regulations allow him to file for your parole again
he 's putting you on

i UNknown l take that commentary back
i UNknown l write a letter of apology right away
good you 'r e here
couldn 't be any sooner
let 's go
it 's the best way
let 's not discuss it again please
UNknown council contacted our embassy in UNknown
they want our troops out of afghanistan
and six million dollars
the army is a cover
it 's always about money
can you recapture the hostage ?
we have no intelligence there
we 'd need our allies assistance
what about the finances ?
after the latest scandal we must be very cautious
it 's an extraordinary situation
the life of the polish mp is at stake
six million is a problem ? !
UNknown members don 't pay terrorists
that 's the latest resolution
what about an unofficial way ?
unofficially companies may pay for their abducted employees
but this is an mp
last night on the border of afghanistan and UNknown a polish mp jan UNknown has been abducted
ai UNknown has broadcast a short film
please be advised of its violent content
good it 's only an mp
his kind deserves good spanking
shut up !
the warriors are right
this is not our war
may l ?
before the end of the day
we 'r e looking at some work here
but for you boss we 'd be stuck here all day
who 's to be the UNknown ?
you of course
he wasn 't kidnapped by the russians
and UNknown most probably speak their UNknown language
the embassy has an interpreter
have you informed bukowski yet ?
you 'r e late
we have to buy out our mp from the UNknown
the government 's set up a crisis group
we do the job as usual
UNknown will fill you in he is the UNknown
we know your achievements
we risk a lot so no one may learn about my plan
UNknown will fly off to UNknown and start negotiating with the kidnappers
he UNknown l prolong it
it isn 't a significant group
they seem to care only about the money
i thought you wanted it quick and effective
make it long and troubled
what do you mean print ?
that 's your job
i get it
won 't they watch over us ?
we 'r e trying to obtain the real cash at the same time
i UNknown l take care of that
when the UNknown figure it out they UNknown l kill me and the hostage
they won 't
he tricked even the us federal bank
what if we get the real money ?
then we UNknown l split the forged cash between us
just print them neatly
he 's a pussy
major wants to talk
how can i be of any use ?
you UNknown l get back to the printing press for a while
i quit it
lf you do it well we UNknown l reduce your time by one third
i UNknown l get that for good conduct
six million ?
my mechanic UNknown 's doing time in UNknown
the paper the paint
we UNknown l release the mechanic
you can start tomorrow
do you have my UNknown ?
i 'd rather you did it today
we 'r e pressed for time
i UNknown l do my best
lf everything works out you UNknown l go back for a year
in a minimum security unit
we UNknown l negotiate tomorrow
the situation is difficult
yet we can 't recapture the mp by force
i understand you have some options ?
we may ask pakistan the release of terrorists from the prison
it 's quite unreal but we UNknown l try
we need time to organize the money
UNknown has influential friends
just figure out how to hand the money over ?
i sold my flat to pay the debts his partner got him in
i moved here but had no heart to get rid of this collection
he 's been collecting them since i remember
some real collector 's items are here
do you know how it feels ?
we wanted to have children
it 's for you
it sucks doesn 't it ?
don 't worry
and he offers me freedom
you didn 't wait long
all i know is the last time i did that it turned nasty on me
you need extra security then
the minister of the UNknown affairs and the administration has sent an experienced UNknown there
i told you they 'd buy the UNknown out
when will you see the chief screw ?
ln a moment
every fag 's a cop ?
successful attempt of translation
i haven 't been to theater for 5 years
you get what you need
i 'm the boss in the printing house
you release my mechanic and UNknown his time too
i spend nights with my woman
and my UNknown will work in the library
UNknown the rest of your time ?
i can accept the UNknown 's thing his time is almost done
but you may get a temporary leave at best
you UNknown l apply for parole and we shall grant it
a leave ?
the UNknown of your sentence will last at least a year
3 months at the most or forget about the whole thing
i UNknown l tell her i UNknown e gotten a leave to do social service
you know i keep my mouth shut
take the prisoner to his cell !
we UNknown e got a deal ?
who works for us in UNknown ?
walk 's over UNknown
i 'm in the embassy in UNknown
nobody knows anything here
he 's got your UNknown and an UNknown for you
i 'i i caii you in the evening
everything 's under control mr prime minister
the UNknown is already there
he 's setting out tomorrow
i 'm in touch with the agency
yes i UNknown l call you tomorrow
i vouch for bukowski
i was thinking about it a lot in the slammer
not enough since you did not allow me to visit you
don 't be mad
i UNknown e got to go
do you need anything else ?
we UNknown e got everything except these
you can buy them in regular stores
these are the numbers of UNknown at the UNknown UNknown 's
you just need to confiscate them
take it off
i also need a UNknown lens
the american paper has red and blue threads
it took us several months to figure out you just need to add some red and blue old clothes
23 linen 7 7 cotton
here 's a UNknown line that says
the united states of america
but you can do this ?
your department once judged my hundreds to be perfect
the soot doesn 't tolerate smoke
get to work
i want you to give me a UNknown
on the abduction of UNknown mp
i UNknown l think about it
anything in it for us ?
i UNknown e been sniffing around
i have a gut feeling
it 's just the usual stuff
kidnapping demands negotiations
why did they send an inexperienced UNknown ?
he doesn 't even know the language
i 'm not surprised by that
they UNknown e got a history of screw ups
just don 't get us in trouble again
they UNknown e been UNknown by the security agency
do you have any contacts there ?
you can 't hide it prime minister
everyone will want to know whether we 'r e paying or not
tell them we 'r e discussing with pakistan the possibility of freeing the hostage
it UNknown l be easier to account for
we 'r e also working on obtaining the cash
keep an eye on this
what 's up ?
i have a proposition for you
with no introduction ?
call me UNknown
does it make them more serious ?
i UNknown e found a lead i need to verify
i want to write an article about it
i know it will be excellent
can you answer a couple of my questions ?
i know it 's confidential but you may have some info by now ?
every detail is of interest to me
i UNknown e thought of everything
would you guess it 's counterfeit ?
they 'r e not counterfeit
they 'r e UNknown
doesn 't it hurt any more ?
for a professional service we want to let a criminal walk free
but it gives you no remorse does it ?
what 's up ?
where can you get one ?
from the manufacturer in japan
they print documents !
they did when i worked for them five years ago
do we have anyone in there ?
not any more
you 'r e coming with me
you UNknown l show me the way
move it !
we 'r e investigating the promotion of fascism
your printing house is involved
it 's some misunderstanding
we have some urgent work to do
the service takes time
paint distributor for UNknown 600
it 's only for the government 's orders
yes but you printed german papers 3 months ago 1 00 000 of them
that was no government 's order
the order came from abroad
it was paid in UNknown ln advance
we must earn our living
this is no crime
you know it 's against the law
it was a one time business
what do you want me to say ?
i didn 't arrange it !
it doesn 't matter
you UNknown l have that pump UNknown and in the meantime you UNknown l tell us about the tender
they UNknown l probably take me straight back to the slammer
i UNknown l come to say goodbye
i don 't know
what 's up ?
i may not be back
your products passed the test
same for me
what are your plans for the future ?
taking some vacation
i don 't even want to hear it
finish your drink
you 'r e not made to be a hero
next time i won 't save you
the box to the office
take UNknown with you
gotta be in to get out
how about the negotiations ?
do you know anything yet ?
i UNknown e checked a couple of things
you were right
but something else bothers me
what is that ?
give me a break
maybe you could give me some information ?
how is it ?
he didn 't come back from work
a prisoner went out to town ?
they seldom escape right before the end of their time
let 's not stir things up now
how 's your UNknown ?
any progress ?
takes you a lot of time
can 't the ministry of finance spare six million ?
it 's not within the interest of your department
my department likes to keep an eye on everything
everything 's working out as planned
will you tell me what it 's about ?
it 's about nothing
can you look at them please ?
they all look real
americans print them at several different locations
UNknown are okay
UNknown of standard UNknown
they don 't seem to have been used
so they aren 't counterfeit ?
amateurs think hundred dollar bills are the easiest as they are only green and black
americans make other bills colorful
like their visa stamps
UNknown counterfeit is almost impossible
he was busted some 2 years ago ?
he 's in so he couldn 't make these ones

i must apologize for not telling you everything
there was no abduction
they had some UNknown stuff on him
the UNknown took money for the masquerade
i used my old contacts to get to them
so we killed two birds with one stone
the mp is coming back as a hero and we UNknown l split the money
where was he then ?
ln an oasis near UNknown cooling down
you aren 't mad are you ?
UNknown i 'd say
UNknown 's sniffing around
it was a pure coincidence
i don 't believe in coincidence
why 'r e you walking around like that ?
walking or sitting you 'r e in the slammer anyway
don 't piss me off !
i UNknown e got to make a call and remind them of me
have you got it ?
you UNknown l call when the guard 's off to the loo
will he go ?
i 'm in the slammer if you care to know
good you UNknown e called
our deal 's off
remember the gun you played with recently ?
it 's part of evidence
be nice or we UNknown l speed up the investigation
that 's all
which book can you recommend ?
what about the memories of a blue uniform ?
it 's me
adventure of a lifetime ?
here are the photos
i believe you
he keeps all his extra money there
now i happened to come across those porn shots
you happened to ?
i didn 't get the girls for him
it 's just that one photographer owed me a favor
the inmates may use some entertainment

i better not find out that this was about protecting nate
if you 'r e falling for him
i 'm not
the captain is being charged with embezzlement and fraud
there 's a different way to get our lives back dad one that doesn 't require another felony
you be a man and you turn yourself in
the moment you slept with jenny humphrey that was the best thing that ever happened to me because i got over you
if that 's the truth then why haven 't you told anyone about jenny ?
you wouldn 't
her name 's jenny humphrey
especially when you 'r e not alone
what have we here ?
bed UNknown in hair in missionary UNknown and yesterday 's dress with today 's shame all over it
it turns out he actually has some UNknown qualities
he 's handsome in an old hollywood way
he 's smart
so what are you doing here ?
he also collects women that he puts into cabs a new one each morning and i 'm not gonna be one of them
i won 't be
you look exhausted
it was awful
and i knew that he was there just lying in wait like in real life
but then when he attacked me he turned out to be a she
like chuck in drag or an actual girl ?
i don 't know !
i was blind
and that hair so long and
b hey can we talk about this on our way to school ?
without the cab UNknown
uh i 'm gonna meet you there
there 's something i need to do first
oh just visiting my dad
thought i 'd check in
you okay ?
yeah i suppose
how was your big night with juliet ?
totally worth the wait
this morning she bolted
you know maybe have breakfast at tom 's stay in bed all day
i don 't know
i know this might come as a shock but maybe she didn 't want to skip class
you haven 't punished blair enough for driving eva away ?
as i told her i UNknown e hardly begun
besides i actually like it here
apparently he 's fortune 500
i 'm curious to meet the man see what lessons there are to be learned
speaking of where 's blair ?
don 't tell me she threw in the towel after just one round ?
she UNknown l be here
uh if you UNknown l excuse me i 'm going to sit with them
from what i hear UNknown players know how to handle a UNknown
hold the door please
this is psychology of business right ?
the new professor
anybody there ?
blair whatever you 'r e about to do my dad and lily are gonna be home any minute
not to worry little j
this is going to be a very short conversation
i let you walk away after you UNknown yourself out to chuck because i assumed you were smart enough never to come back
i might UNknown e been willing to make exceptions for holidays birthdays health emergencies of immediate family members but i don 't believe any of those UNknown apply
blair i 'm just here for one day
i have an interview with tim UNknown and if everything goes well then he UNknown l write me a recommendation letter for parsons
parsons is still in manhattan is it not ?
you were banished
look blair i 'm not looking to UNknown your social order
you know how much fashion means to me and parsons is the school for it
i UNknown l call you a car to take you back to hudson and wait while you pack
how about a day pass ?
i promise i UNknown l leave directly after my interview
and you know who knows if tim UNknown 's even gonna like my work ?
but either way i promise i won 't set foot in manhattan for the rest of the year not even christmas
jenny free holiday season
amnesty till midnight
that 's kind of awkward
yeah especially because you said you were going to class
were you following me or something ?
i 'm visiting my dad
he 's in for fraud and embezzlement
he just got transferred down from upstate
oh my god
well it 's usually not a part of my a game pillow talk
i mean it was in all the papers
i thought you might know and and i wouldn 't have to talk about it
no i i didn 't
i 'm sorry
no it 's okay
so who are you here for ?
your brother you were telling me about ?
why didn 't you just tell me that this morning ?
look all i wanted to do was stay in bed with you and
i don 't know
like you said not exactly the best pillow talk
well i think it 's great you do something like that
all right i gotta get going before my dad wonders where i am
but um is it cool if i swing by later check out your class ?
i UNknown l see you back in the city ?
what 's wrong ?
cab guy ?
i can 't believe this is happening
i 'm already on thin ice with the dean
what am i supposed to do ?
but i UNknown l talk to him
office hours !
if people found out she defied you they won 't
and let me remind you
i sent her packing for both of our sakes
if it was ever made public that you had a dangerous liaison with a teenage UNknown who also technically is your UNknown you 'd be socially UNknown
well i 'd be mad to have anything to do with her return then wouldn 't i ?
arthur pull the car around
it 's time to make the stop i requested
reporting for duty !
you 'r e on UNknown
jenny humphrey is back
i gave her a day pass but she is not to move one inch outside that building without me knowing
got it ?
but we UNknown l still dying to know why you deported jenny in the first place
yours is not to wonder why
yours is to do or die
well i 'm only here for a day
i didn 't want to make a big deal out of it
if dad put out a spread like this every time you came home
i 'd be inviting you more often
i can see why tim UNknown is dying to meet with you
are you kidding ?
parsons would be lucky to have her
hey how about uh dinner at UNknown tonight celebrate us all being back together ?
um i 'd actually kinda rather stay in if that 's okay
um dad 's chili ?
yeah i know but i have a um a couple finishing touches to do on my dresses so if you guys will excuse me
i 'm sorry rufus but the chili the smell it UNknown
well blair stopped by with her welcome wagon
i don 't know why
i thought i could sneak back in for a day but
well how did she know you were here before i did ?
she 's the wicked witch of the upper east side
you know i 'm sure one of her monkeys spotted me getting off the train or something
but it 's fine
that 's ridiculous
but really though i mean i have no interest in going back to being g i jenny and UNknown with blair
how very UNknown of you
but in case eastern philosophy does fail you how about i meet you downtown after my class and i can escort you back up here ?
thanks but really the only person i have to worry about today is tim UNknown
what are you doing here chuck ?
i wanted to speak with her
and say what ?
and letting my psycho ex girlfriend run you out of town ?
something like that except without the sarcasm
yeah well i think i can deliver that message and i think you can find the elevator
oh how can i argue with big brother ?
i UNknown l just grab these blueprints lily left for me
i UNknown l let you get back to your hemingway complex
you know i almost respect this side to you humphrey
tell jenny i said hello and i 'm truly sorry
was i that boring ?
come to think of it you raced off pretty fast this morning as well
well i know the routine
i wanted to save you the effort of walking me out and UNknown me a cab
does that mean you think last night was a mistake ?
the opposite actually
i was one of your usual conquests
you made that pretty clear last night when you declined to be conquered
all of this however was before i found out you were my professor
and relationships with faculty are strictly forbidden and i i don 't want last night to affect how you treat me as a student
i UNknown e gotta say that didn 't sound very heartfelt
wanna try it again with a little more conviction ?
i UNknown e said what i needed to say
you can have the t a mark my papers
may i offer a UNknown ?
i have to go to this party tonight for the new york observer
i 'm getting some kind of eligible bachelor award
will you come with me ?
wouldn 't bringing a date make you UNknown for an award like that ?
maybe having you on my arm would be honor enough
if i give up my bachelor title and commit to getting to know you better maybe you could put off UNknown the psychology of business for another semester ?
well it 's not like business is my major
and it 's still the add drop period so
i UNknown l pick you up
the messenger 's picking them up so that the models can get fitted okay ?
i understand your reluctance to ever speak to me again
and i don 't wanna bother you
i was picking up some bass industries blueprints earlier and it seems i UNknown took your UNknown
chuck i don 't know what type of game you 'r e playing but my interview 's in an hour
you have to bring it back right now
i would of course but i 'm heading into a meeting i can 't UNknown
can you swing by the empire ?
so you won 't have to
i left it at the front desk with my concierge
good luck today
or it 's go !
follow that cab !
watch out j break a deal with the devil
we didn 't
i need the address of tim UNknown 's studio
and there will be hell to pay
dan you didn 't have to meet me here
besides i 'm already late
i was in the neighborhood
but this is veronica and she was out here waiting for you
no problem jenny
uh wish me luck ?
i don 't have to
i mean UNknown you 'r e my sister and i love you so i 'm UNknown
but if you can take blair in stride today
tim UNknown will be a piece of cake
don 't tell him i said that
collect call from a UNknown facility
do you accept these charges ?
where were you today ?
i came but nate
his father 's in prison with you
i did but he just transferred and i bumped into nate outside
don 't worry
i mean we we talked
and he 's not like the others
he might actually understand
you think he 's gonna understand then ?
i don 't know
maybe you 'r e right
i UNknown e put a lot on you
you 'r e my little sister
you deserve to be happy
hey you know a new guy in here
last name archibald ?
don 't tell me word reached you that rufus is making his famous chili
jenny 's in town
well i know you two haven 't exactly been the best of friends in the past but maybe that can change now that you UNknown e had some time apart
well as much as i would love to bond with her
i actually have plans special plans that involve me raiding my mother 's jewelry box
those are special plans
oh it 's just a book by one of my professors
but i 'm
a must read for 21st century c e o s
serena i can 't tell you how happy it makes me to see you taking such a challenging course just right out of the gate
honestly after the year that you UNknown e had it 's wonderful to see you thinking about your future instead of UNknown on boys
especially for someone so young
oh thank you
so you UNknown with eleanor waldorf
that was bold
i didn 't exactly leave on great terms and then my new business partner set all of my dresses on fire so
and then you just left town ?
but i can assure you that all of that 's behind me now
i think that these dresses really express my take on young women today our sense of self confidence and self worth
well let 's take a look
um no we 'r e done
uh that part is not
let 's get ready for the next appointment
uh no i 'm confidence and self worth ?
i don 't know if this is your idea of a joke but it 's not funny
it 's not a joke
i 'm so sorry
mr UNknown please
cause jenny 's already inside
you broke the terms of our agreement
looks like b drew blood
i wondered if i might be able to offer some assistance
well unless it 's a murder suicide
i think i UNknown l pass
tim UNknown is being honored at the observer 's new UNknown of the year party tonight at the boom boom room
why don 't you two accompany me ?
surely jenny can find a quiet moment to plead her case
and why should i actually believe that you 'r e trying to help us here ?
it would be my way of making amends to jenny
why don 't you run it by the brains of the operation ?
i can 't imagine her wanting blair to win this one
chuck can get us into the observer party and tim UNknown 's gonna be there
well it 's not like blair can do anything worse to me
but what about dinner with dad ?
tell your sister
i look forward to seeing you at the festivities
careful little j
she attacks at first sight
you look incredible
you having second thoughts ?
i don 't want her to read that i 'm dropping it in the new york times
well why don 't you just tell her ?
because she UNknown l think
i 'm choosing a man over my future again
you know what ?
pleasure to be here
i mean r i s d
has a great fashion program
we are not letting you give up on parsons
oh you want to be UNknown ?
now 's your chance
mom hey !
change of plan
one more colin
i am just so proud of the student you 'r e becoming your new focus
i know but just
tell your mother that i am crazy about you that i might be your future and i don 't care who knows
serena 's mother
she 's at the observer party
we followed her here
it 's UNknown
tim UNknown is here
i 'm on my way
well the boom boom room is a private club and we 'r e having trouble with the door guy
can you help ?
mr UNknown ?
but um i just
and i would really do anything for a second chance
i think i can arrange for another interview
and don 't let your dresses out of your sight
chuck called you ?
i thought maybe your brother was an inmate and you were just too embarrassed to tell me so i called over there
you called the prison ?
yeah and i 'm sorry
i was just being paranoid and it 's not an excuse but i have a history of believing girls when i shouldn 't
i just wanna make sure we 'r e totally open with each other
there are some things that i need to tell you about me and and my family
wait one second
is everything okay ?
so good to see you
of course you 'r e being honored tonight
what happened ?
what are you guys doing here ?
question is what are you doing here ?
or do you want that dress messed up too ?
leave me alone
we just enjoy UNknown them
besides the obvious ?
we UNknown l see who 's in trouble
why should i ?
looking to paint the town red ?
i don 't know what you UNknown e heard but it isn 't your concern
you got jenny the interview with tim UNknown and you made sure that your friend with no benefits stopped by the empire just to defy me
i told you i wouldn 't rest until you were destroyed
inviting your old UNknown partner back was just my way of avoiding doing all the dirty work myself
jenny always had a talent for making your life a living hell
you UNknown e gone too far
bringing jenny back puts both of our reputations at risk
i love to watch you squirm
the pleasure i get from UNknown your shame is considerable
but i doubt jenny will talk
she thinks she 's above it all but little humphrey still cares what people think
looks like new york 's best kept secret is finally out
turns out little j didn 't lose her v card to UNknown UNknown
she waited and chucked it away with her UNknown
guess that explains the humphrey in hudson
hell hath no fury like a waldorf scorned
it 's obviously not true
jenny put out the blast so that
she would humiliate me
give it up blair
looks like the joke 's on chuck and blair and little j s got the last laugh
it 's a matter of degree
i mean i 'm a little embarrassed that the entire world knows
i lost it to chuck bass
but did you see their faces ?
i mean blair looked like she might cry
well so much for zen jenny humphrey
come on dan
it 's what blair and chuck would UNknown e done
oh serena please you don 't need to apologize
i get it
well i understand the lure of a powerful man like colin
i married bart bass remember ?
it 's fine
well it 's not about that
well we both know you would have moved on to classes more your speed eventually
you don 't think i could UNknown e handled a business class ?
well we UNknown l never know now will we ?
darling i 'm just trying to be UNknown and realistic
a pretty girl like you could get the attention of a colin forrester even without an education
so why even bother ?
lil i think you may have taken this tough love a little too literally this time
well um after serena left this afternoon
i bought colin 's book and on chapter 16 it talks about reverse psychology
nothing i UNknown e done so far has gotten through so i thought i 'd try something new
do you know who it was ?
do you have a problem with someone ?
i UNknown e never seen UNknown m before
i told UNknown m nothing stronger than a UNknown
did you let your mother know ?
nate it 's okay
this wasn 't exactly what she signed up for
yeah well whatever happened to in good times and bad ?
i don 't know
i just wish she could see how great you 'r e doing now
present situation UNknown
that 's enough for now
nothing i can do about the rest till i get parole
well just try and stay safe until then
you know no reading
thank you UNknown and thank you UNknown for marrying UNknown and giving someone else the chance to win bachelor this year
this is quite an honor but one i would gladly give up for the right woman
mom let 's go
anyway um thank you all
are you happy now that you UNknown e humiliated both of us ?
check your own bloody hands lady macbeth
what did you think would happen when you played carrie with her dresses ?
i only did it because you lured her back here to torture me
i warned you i wouldn 't stop
and thanks to your UNknown we both lost and jenny humphrey won
if you UNknown e come to gloat i would relish the moment
it will be fleeting
despite what happened today i can 't beat you
in order to beat you i 'd have to become you and i 'm better than that
at least i wanna be
nice try jenny
you two used to be in love and together you were invincible
but now that you UNknown e turned against each other it 's just a matter of time before your mutual destruction
and when that happens maybe i UNknown l think about coming home but for now good bye good riddance and good luck
we hear little j gave chuck and blair a good bye kiss
i was just gonna leave a note under your door
it explains everything
actually i 'm working on my lecture for monday 's class
fewer models and martinis more UNknown and UNknown
i know you need to figure out what you wanna do with your life serena
i UNknown e been there
but it 's only seven weeks
as teacher and student
well then teacher i UNknown l see you monday
and don 't even think about leaving an apple on my desk
you UNknown e got no shot at being teacher 's pet
seriously dan you don 't have to ride with me all the way to the border
pretty sure i 'm safe now
besides i 'm leaving like blair wanted
no no i 'm not guarding you
i 'm just uh just hanging out
i 'm really proud of you jen
oh give it some time
let your brooklyn d n a guide you to righteousness
well if it 's your d n a that i share then maybe i have a chance
they say war 's not the answer
but sometimes it 's a battle just to keep the peace
if you 'r e here to deliver any further humiliation
UNknown can sign for it
jenny was right
i assume you feel the same
about myself ?
it 'd be more subtle
look we can keep blaming each other for what happened that night or we can admit a harder truth it was no one 's fault
it was fate
nate wouldn 't have been at the hospital looking for her and jenny wouldn 't have come looking for nate
if UNknown hadn 't gone into labor
maybe everything would be different
but it 's not
but we don 't have to
we have a choice
i know the way
but that 's all right
because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i can 't tell you what it really is
i can only tell you what it feels like and right now
on the upper east side you may stand down but you can never give up
and the UNknown UNknown are always UNknown of love
i don 't think so
my dad 's gonna be okay
thanks for asking
but what ?
okay well let me make it easy for you
you find out that nate archibald 's dad 's a jailbird and you decide you can do better or maybe you already have
nate please you 'r e different than anyone i UNknown e ever known
no you know what ?
just save it okay ?
cause you 'r e exactly like everyone i UNknown e ever known
i 'm so sorry but i have to go
just gonna stand there and
i love the way you lie
i assume you are here for your check and not just to raid my liquor cabinet
i 'm sorry to be so UNknown
and we fall back into the same patterns
baby please come back
you weren 't kidding when you said it 'd be a challenge
well all good things are worth waiting for aren 't they ?
but our most dangerous enemies are the ones we never knew we had
so if you want peace always be prepared for war
x o x o gossip girl
yes yes indeed sir
rather a grind eh ?
few can take it seriously
the work has to be done your grace
one does what is expected of one if that 's what you mean
you sit in the UNknown in my UNknown and i sit here entertaining half the UNknown in london
hah and the country thinks it 's getting its money 's worth and let 's the thing go on
there 's no pleasure in doing all this you know as you UNknown l find out when it 's your turn
i never think about it your grace
too wrapped up in all those UNknown black books of yours
blue books your grace
the important thing is that there should be a UNknown sitting in the house as a UNknown
UNknown they 'r e called nowadays
and now it 's your turn
and they tell me you are making a very nice stride
i UNknown e told UNknown that from now on your account is to see to be UNknown with an extra three thousand a year
well thank you duke
your grace is very good
oh i 'm not answering to know how things ought to be done
well i don 't think you UNknown l find much to interest a serious fellow like yourself
who 's been honored with a very long audience
you forget how long i UNknown e been away dolly
and also his heir not that he makes much of it
he 's a dedicated house of UNknown man UNknown is
so it follows that he don 't much care about being a duke
um he looks a very know what it means when the time comes all the same
oh he 's got a certain air about him all right has UNknown
but he doesn 't set himself up like other men would in his place
except when he 's saying his piece in the UNknown he keeps himself to himself
and he doesn 't do the sort of things that chaps like you and me do george
well they do say that he lives in such style that he can 't afford it too
but if you ask me george he just never fancied being tied up
oh he likes the ladies all right but he 's well enough suited without them
what about his nephew um
he 's never look at a woman since they let him out of the nursery
well he 's looking at one now dolly
the fair girl over there on the bridge
by jove she 's bowing to him !
you know who she is of course ?
no who ?
she 's as dull as she 's long and cold as a cod
and what 's more she 's married as heavy as a ton of bricks to lord UNknown 's son
nothing very much i could say
just being civil
but now that he 's there dolly his behavior is not exactly passionate
you don 't understand UNknown for UNknown pal to go within
ten yards of a woman is an act of absolute frenzy
i have lady UNknown
i think i may say uh gracious
there are very few men like you luther
you UNknown e uh been in the house lately mr UNknown ?
i go everyday lady UNknown
oh you were so fascinating about it last time you went
the weights measures and UNknown act we were discussing
was it not ?
would it interest you lady UNknown to to hear more about it ?
oh it would mr UNknown it would
oh how very UNknown you put it mr UNknown
20 shillings in the pound ; 21 in the guinea ; 12 pennies in a shilling ; 12 UNknown in a penny
i i tell you lady UNknown it 's a scandal in its human intellect
tell me adelaide how long has lady UNknown been married ?
oh about 18 months
ohh she seems rather to fancy young mr UNknown
she was very strictly brought up you know
an UNknown 's daughter
no man is entirely respectable
not if he 's got any UNknown blood in his veins
he won 't like it very much
but i hardly think it would be notice
of respectability would worry him
my lord duke
i UNknown l sit out a pair of waltzes and then i UNknown l go in
his grace wishes the dancing to UNknown
it 's getting chilly
well that 's the duke 's concern adelaide
mine is UNknown
i could have sworn UNknown was all right
she was playing croquet with lord and lady UNknown
well she ain 't playing croquet now !
she 's waltzing with UNknown fitzgerald
i can hear her UNknown from here !
there 's nothing you can do about it
charlotte but sit quietly and behave as though nothing were happening
UNknown kisses UNknown on the cheek
my god what a lovely girl
who is she dolly ?
i knew him yes
that is the lady UNknown mccluskey
the only daughter and the only child of the late lord of the isles
her mother is dead now so she 's an orphan
she 's worth a queen 's mint in money
she 's only been out a few months
and already UNknown fitzgerald has his hooks in
some say that he is very fond of her in his way
and she certainly likes the cut of him
but there 's a great big black fly in that ointment
she 's got a guardian the marquis of auld UNknown
he don 't count for much if i remember rightly
but his wife counts for more than a dozen and she 'd sooner that UNknown married the devil rather than UNknown fitzgerald
that 's her behind that weeping elm
in that lair
there ain 't much chance for UNknown fitzgerald while she sits there watching
who 's the old UNknown with her ?
that is the countess of UNknown
she takes an occasional shift when the old toad starts UNknown
twenty four hour picket you see
i i cannot i i will not allow her !
to throw herself away
and mr fitzgerald as she informed me only the other day
is descended from richard the UNknown
and the blood had gone bad long before it had reached him
and she 's been following him about with stars in her eyes ever since you brought her down from scotland
it must be done adelaide
and this very evening
oh keep thinking adelaide keep thinking
if uh UNknown 's have it still like they were
how does he manage about money ?
some say that his aunt
lady monk does it for him
some say that it 's one of the UNknown
but if you ask me george his best friends are the jews
so either way the uh the rich little mccluskey would suit him down to the ground
music stops ; applause
the commercial advantages of any
i do apologize
it 's not quite my line
ah but it may be lady UNknown 's
is it you line ?
i was just listening to mr UNknown
he 's been telling me all about the house of UNknown
but UNknown why do you never have such fascinating things to tell me as mr UNknown tells lady UNknown
excuse me mr UNknown but at last i see lord UNknown
oh yes yes yes of course
mr UNknown i should think
he knows so much more to be boring about
why of course
he can 't be meaning to go off with lady UNknown
that 's all nonsense
the name is right
and what is more charlotte
the man 's right
someone to simmer her down
the duke !
uh lady auld UNknown
quite the round as it will suit us
in brief duke my ward lady UNknown mccluskey and your nephew mr UNknown UNknown
have you spoken to the lady UNknown about it ?
no but we soon shall if your grace is of a mind with us
well they tell me that she 's a young lady who likes her own way
oh but what young lady does not
UNknown must learn to put her duty before her preference
we shall teach her
and you hope that i will teach mr UNknown
and i find that it will do
i find that it will suit me well enough
made a lot of tin i suppose
it depends on what you mean by enjoyment dolly
i mean to go into parliament
well your own grandfather up in UNknown won 't approve of that
after all he refused to shell out for you for a seat before you went away
uh huh that 's why i went away
but now i UNknown e got a bit of my own money dolly and i intend to spend it as i please and be damned of my own grandfather
that 's all very well george but he might UNknown you
not a chance
but it ain 't UNknown on you
but my dead father was the eldest son and that old mule up in UNknown believes in UNknown as UNknown as he believes in holy writ
do you remember my cousin alice ?
the girl you was engaged to ?
he lives down in the UNknown near ely and he 's as dull as the mud that he lives in
everyone seems to suppose that
george is going into parliament just to annoy his grandfather at UNknown hall
i just might have more serious motives dolly
but first you UNknown l have to find a seat
lord dally UNknown ?
it 's too late old boy
his father is near dead of the whiskeys
so if the house of lords would value by him in a bye election in the chelsea district
i hope not
well you can manage that old man after all the loot that you brought home from the colonies
you should have gone with him UNknown
some of it might have rubbed off on you
huh huh huh
i think UNknown that the time has come for some supper
coming george ?
uh huh everyone knows
your cousin alice UNknown
if that is
those horrible old women hanging around UNknown with their fangs UNknown make it awfully hard for us to meet
i warn you UNknown my cousin alice though a spirited girl is very UNknown UNknown
just so that UNknown and i can be in the same room
i UNknown l have a word with her UNknown
let me say it plainly and for the last time UNknown
you can not receive mr fitzgerald in this house
why not ?
that 's why not
you marry that UNknown fitzgerald missy and he UNknown l gamble away everything you UNknown e got and then beat you when it 's gone
well i 'd would rather be beaten by UNknown fitzgerald than kissed by anybody else
it 's a lovely day and i may through walk in the park
you 'r e not going to meet that man !
don 't worry aunt according to your idea that he 's lying in bed full of brandy and won 't get up till dinner
and if i do meet him what then ?
you UNknown l take your maid missy
oh yes i UNknown l take my maid and then mr fitzgerald can UNknown her too
i i want to say a word or two in season
the fact is people have been talking about you and lady UNknown
upon my word people are very kind
kind enough are they not ?
but you have i think been seen much in her company
well lady UNknown and i have a common interest in things
i have been very intimate with their family
and at one time with none more intimate then with lady UNknown
who as you are doubtless aware is lady UNknown 's mother in law
say it or not as you choose
but you should remember that UNknown
i have given much and asked nothing
in this matter i expect to be obliged
if you are looking for someone to spend your time with you could do a lot worse than that little UNknown mccluskey
devilish taking little woman
ha ha you UNknown l find little mccluskey understands politics well enough
if you explain them the right way
how could a man eh a politician that is better said remain independent and UNknown ?
well how ?
and as such UNknown
well then he must trim his opinions in accord with those of his masters
yes mr UNknown
there are some things lady UNknown for which the world might well be lost
a signal whistling
that maid 's going to speak to my aunt
i can 't believe i met you by accident
UNknown it was no accident
i was waiting for you outside lady auld UNknown 's house
when i saw you come out i followed you and cut you off
UNknown we must have somewhere to meet properly
now listen do you know a cousin of yours called alice UNknown ?
the one that looks like a policeman ?
i hardly ever see her
well start seeing her now
go to her everyday until it becomes a matter of course
you understand ?
we won 't have much fun
oh yes you will when the other cousin starts arriving
george UNknown bringing me with him
and you UNknown l see that will become a matter of course
and then gradually everything will fall into place
oh thank you mr UNknown
mr UNknown i hope you UNknown l excuse me but
i wonder you don 't think of marrying
marrying mr UNknown ?
i tender the suggestion because i am half afraid of some some UNknown of good feeling between you and your uncle
i was not aware of any such probability
i trust there is none but the duke is a very determined man if he takes anything into his head
and then you know he has so much in his power
well he has not me in his power mr UNknown
oh no no no one man does not have another in his power in this country mr UNknown
but only think if he should take offense what one word of his might do
there is this new arrangement UNknown you now receive an extra three thousand pounds a year
now would it ?
but then i would rather not offend anyone
now the trouble is mr UNknown you ain 't stop seeing that certain party now have you ?
will you excuse me mr UNknown ?
i have another appointment
good morning mr UNknown
uh you have followed my drift ?
of the climax to which i am now coming ?
yes yes pray come to it quickly mr UNknown
but they surely can be mr UNknown
oh they surely can
by the simple UNknown of having ten pennies in every shilling
instead of twelve
nor i him
i am his heir
but kate 's up there
she UNknown l look after my interests with old squire UNknown
kate may be a very loyal sister to you but she won 't be able to guard your interests if she isn 't there
what do you mean not there ?
haven 't you heard george ?
kate and my father and i are going to switzerland for a twelve week tour
we leave at the end of next month
no i hadn 't heard
it was arranged before you came back
i 'm not sure it suits me
kate leaving the old man for 12 weeks
then you UNknown l have to be UNknown
kate needs a change george and a change she 's going to have
a wretched dull place switzerland
where are you going ?
UNknown UNknown and then on to UNknown where we shall be joined for a while by by mr grey
i broke it off with you for excellent reasons which you very well remember
and i 'm not obliged to remain a spinster all my life in your memory
mr grey is a scholar and a gentleman
will be a husband whom i can love and trust
they tell me he 's a damned dull dog
if you 'r e going to talk like that george i think you 'd better leave
perhaps i had
huh huh i very much hope so
i UNknown l bring a friend with me if i may
my old chum UNknown fitzgerald
he wants to meet you
good morning duke
i don 't think you UNknown e met old friend lady UNknown
but you are of course acquainted with her daughter in law lady UNknown
now lady UNknown
then we can all understand one another
well come along my dear nobody 's going to eat you
like each other
she means UNknown that she is called a countess and one day she UNknown l be a UNknown which is good enough going for any lady in the land
even for one as beautiful as she is
uh so there 's no point in upsetting UNknown and tossing away the whole thing
what for ?
but as to that sir no one need think
i 'm too old to marry and get a few sons if it suits me
lady UNknown has done me the goodness to see the force of my arguments
i very much hope that you will follow her example
fetch her ladyship 's carriage
you see my dear boy she never really wanted you
and you don 't really want her
all this billing and cooing just isn 't your style
now do as i ask you there 's a good fellow
and everything will go as neat and steady as the clock
marry the little mccluskey
sounds of carriage arriving
after so long lady UNknown
oh don 't be unkind
well i waited and waited for you to come to me and then when you didn 't i said to myself
alice has deserted me
well if the mountain won 't come to mohammed
and here i am
but uh first of all
i must beg of you tell me all about mr grey
he writes long articles for the UNknown and lives in his small house near ely where he walks in his garden and reads in his library
so everything has turned out very conveniently except for poor mr george UNknown
mr george UNknown was to blame for that
but you still see him though ?
oh yes indeed
and mr fitzgerald with him ?
why do you mention mr fitzgerald lady UNknown ?
well i know him to be a friend of mr UNknown 's
and when you see
you will tell them that i cannot receive mr fitzgerald
please alice please
alice what the devil 's going on ?
nothing is going on mr UNknown
not in my house
but i will not have this house used as a place of UNknown
now send him away
why should i not see him ?
why should i not marry him ?
he is my equal
but something is badly amiss lady UNknown if you must meet him by UNknown in the house of a distant cousin
in the house of a friend
as i thought
alice next to him i will love you better than all the world
that would mean much to me
you 'r e heartless !
you you have never loved !
oh but i have
i understand but for a woman to give her love to a certain kind of man is UNknown
i 'm sorry for you
i know what it means to reject love
but you have the strength to do it
i have not
if you please
no one would know you
the queen would not receive you
and your children would be
worse than nameless bearing his name
but mr UNknown UNknown
i am rich in my own rights
mr UNknown will not waste your achievements
then one day the old duke will die
and you will be a duchess
the lady UNknown is enough
mr UNknown is much concerned with politics
and i am not
quite the reverse
so you will have plenty of leisure for your own chosen UNknown
poetry and uh that kind of a thing
mr UNknown is a very gentle very innocent man
not given to worldly manners
imagining others to be as innocent as he
and so knowing nothing of the realities which lie behind the poetry books
of which you dear UNknown are so fond
crows cawing ; birds singing
our friends say we may do very well together
can it be so ?
can it be so lady UNknown ?
if you wish it mr UNknown
i do wish it
there has been another life and i loved him
it shall not signify
UNknown in this as in all things you UNknown e shown yourself to be everything that i could desire
UNknown wedding present
and i am sending her a carriage and six pairs of horses
those are small a memento of this auspicious engagement
UNknown has been instructed to place substantial amounts of railway and mining stock in your name
and above all this you will be paid an annual allowance such as UNknown a married gentleman who is my UNknown heir
your grace is extremely generous sir
i do have one UNknown is that material UNknown alone do not necessarily make for a happy marriage
there are other things to consider
indeed there are but you UNknown e nothing to worry about that there she 's a nice enough little girl and wink very appetizing with it
what more can you ask ?
some people might mention love
well the two are sometimes talked about in UNknown
well see here UNknown UNknown may marry for love if they choose but when UNknown marry they marry for more important reasons
and UNknown are still flesh and blood your grace
oh enough of that
well we can 't know that in duke
well you must UNknown to suit each other at any rate until there 's a son
two to be on the safe side
after that you at least can suit yourself
uh uh but just see to it that there 's no open scandal
ho ho when i was a boy it didn 't really matter much
although some reason it does now
there will be no scandal duke
because there will be no cause
if you will your grace i know that you have never taken marriage vows
but you must know that they UNknown fidelity
aww words UNknown
well you do as you like about that
in any case i 'm very well pleased both with you and this arrangement
and the sooner the day the better
alice see see i UNknown e come in here because you were kind very firm but very kind
they UNknown e just been tormenting me until i couldn 't bear it anymore
mr UNknown is a good kind man who UNknown himself to parliament in the public interest
they 'r e forcing me forcing me to marry !
british UNknown are sailing with stronger destroyer escorts
germany sends more submarines into battle
keeping the allies in check in the atlantic
from 40 000 german sailors 30 000 never return
our bosun 's mate
who are those pigs ?
their UNknown drill
it 's time to find ourselves a little french quail
do you know how to flush it out ?
they 'r e scared
what 's going on here ?
welcome on board lieutenant
good evening captain
he should be celebrating his medal
have you talked to your wife ?
no calls to germany before 10 o UNknown lock
all provisions and arms aboard
it was quite outrageous
silence would be appreciated !
i 'd like to call on lt UNknown our latest hero !
UNknown is from the old guard
he 's always drunk now
quiet in this UNknown !
to our wonderful UNknown UNknown fuhrer
who rose UNknown from an apprentice painter
to become the world 's greatest battle UNknown
isn 't it true ?
he 's a great naval expert
who in his infinite wisdom
how does it go again ?
our great fuhrer has been showing their english bed UNknown the cigar UNknown asshole churchill where exactly to go and stick his stinking cigars
i must phone home
look at these new heroes
all wind and smoke
they will know in time
i wanted to really screw my brains out tonight
but i 'm not in any condition to fuck
that 's UNknown 's boat
find anything wrong with our boat ?
the propeller plate was banged
we UNknown e got a brand new one
that 's our boat
the boat is clear for sea captain
thank you number one
he is writing about war heroes
see you remember your manners

of UNknown 's feet !

a german baby

our masters spend all their time finding churchill new UNknown

the propaganda ministry will love it
music we need

2nd november 1941
shadow off the starboard beam
take her down 30 metres
bring her up easy
we have no chance in this light
it 's more than superficial to take care in personal appearance
it UNknown that the inner man is wholesome and upstanding
an officer should be UNknown in his dress and UNknown
in the old days young officers were treated UNknown in this
knowing they risked their lives their superiors
it 's comfortable here
like fresh horse UNknown
no need to work
u boat special cocktail
dived to avoid destroyer
cut off extra supply of fuel to the engines !
torpedo rooms check the UNknown angles
watch out !
here we go girls
we should be there in 10 hours
u 32 is operating against a convoy
we are joining in the hunt
contact expected any time after 18 00 hours
these beauties are ready for blast off
over 30 UNknown
he 's following the convoy
for me it 's the best thrill with u boats and sailing ships
UNknown across the sea
that 's a fine way to waste fuel
we should be within range
why doesn 't UNknown signal us ?
why haven 't we heard from h q ?
visibility is UNknown sir
bow planes up 10
bow planes up 10
a UNknown check
stern planes up 5
despite bad weather commencing operation
damn this stinking weather !
how does it look ?
the enemy should be here
freighter on the starboard bow
over there !
clear the bridge
flood tubes one to four
he wants to attack the destroyer
crazy in this weather
13 5 metres
spread shots one and three
tubes one through four are ready
damn it !
close bow caps !
check all valves and UNknown
no serious damage
control room all secure
it seems constant
now it gets psychological friends
kill unnecessary lights
both engines indicate 50 UNknown
contact coming closer
they 'r e coming straight for us
he knows what he 's doing
forward up 20
get the damn thing UNknown !
hull valves secured
contact closing fast
contact fading to starboard
i think that will be all this time
both main engines 50 UNknown
all compartments report damage
smashed up badly
i UNknown e already started
make it good
i guess we have shaken them off
don 't be too sure
he could have stopped and be waiting
to surprise us when we surface
not dumb the british
i see better in the dark
it 's dark
bow planes up 15
i UNknown e got bad news men
what 's up now ?
our team is losing
it can 't be !
i don 't believe it !
drop UNknown m !
they UNknown l eat your UNknown down to the bone
give him a go with gun powder !
excuse me lieutenant
what are those things crawling about on your eyebrows ?
crabs by the look of them
when the creatures begin to surface it 's the fifth stage
get it all in the torpedo room
you two give me a hand
bosun do you know where the medic is ?
yeah in the bow compartment
the more the merrier
have you heard the latest ?
our UNknown is tying the knot
the stupid pig
they should stick you in a zoo with a chimpanzee
here 's the pictures of her !
you dirty rotten swine !
don 't tell me this hag lets you sleep with her
these boats are built to take it
you should try a sailing ship
you hardly feel a thing down here
i can 't keep on course
no cause for concern
prepare to dive
nothing exciting out there ?
position reports and very faint sos calls from enemy UNknown
when the rudder breaks on one of those old UNknown
there 's nothing to do but pray
the sea can 't sink us UNknown
no ships are as safe as our u boats
you know the one
make way !
prepare to dive
three ribs cracked and a gash on the head
he was lucky
it 's the next best thing to fresh grown lettuce
anything that grows on this boat we UNknown e got to be grateful for
it must be snowing already back home
can i look ?
it 's one of ours
a german u boat !
over there !
my god phillip !
damn it !
damn it !
12 boats we UNknown e got on the atlantic from UNknown to the UNknown
but still we almost UNknown with one of our own
more or less
we UNknown e not had a sun shot in 14 days
we UNknown e been drifting in this storm
it 's hard to UNknown
if we make an error in our position and the others do the same
we end up playing collision games
the route is wide open
the british could shove the whole armada through
i hope you 'r e making notes
maybe headquarters will listen to you
you UNknown e more influence than i have
so you believe that ?
have you got your flashlight ready ?
it 's bound to be a false alarm
what 's up ?
that damn moon !
it 's worth a try captain
come left to 180
it UNknown l work
prepare tubes one to four for surface firing
i 'm going in
all ahead full
watch the pressure of the UNknown oil

that destroy won 't let us go
he UNknown l try and hunt us down
we hit the first
it 's the UNknown
destroyer bearing UNknown
rudder 's right full
they 'r e astern of us way astern of us
they 'r e spitting in the wrong direction
we haven 't thrown them off yet
i reckon they won 't be too happy
propeller noises bearing 270
both engines ahead one third

what 's the damage ?
air shaft fractured
one of the valves is fractured !
UNknown it !
cut the number two auxiliary !
calm down for god 's sake !

make a note for the war diary
aye aye captain
satisfied the destroyers have lost us
intense glow in sky observed at 210 degrees
probably flames from the tanker we hit
we UNknown l surface in ten minutes
switch to red light
you see lieutenant they didn 't kill us
her back 's already broken
she is a tough one
she won 't go down
let 's finish her off
a final shot
ready for surface firing
they UNknown e had six hours
they 'r e swimming towards us
both engines back two thirds
we can 't take prisoners
you know that
here take it
UNknown UNknown a 6 000 UNknown
they 'r e having a field day
any hope of joining them ?
we can 't make it
yes yes !
when it 's time for us to go back and not before UNknown
fired at 950 metres
swam toward u 96
you deserted your post at a critical moment and disobeyed a direct order
you mean to say that there has to be a court martial ?
how many patrols have you done ?
you can depend on it
get some sleep
it 's the bulkhead UNknown
good get it fixed
suppose it 's top secret
another wild goose chase
this relic needs a UNknown
on the fuel we UNknown e got we won 't even make la rochelle
we UNknown l hoist a sail
don 't worry chief
sexy little nurses to comfort and kiss
we UNknown l have a ball !
a UNknown big and fat
now here this
la UNknown naval base in ltaly
we UNknown l pick up fuel and supplies at UNknown in spain
that 's all
no sexy little nurses
we UNknown l have christmas in ltaly
we UNknown e got to get there first !
and so ?
we UNknown l never slip through there
when we reach UNknown you go ashore with the chief
i UNknown e got to find a replacement for the chief
our agents will smuggle you out of spain somehow
dressed up as gypsies for instance
i thought i would be going
i really believe the chief needs a break
his wife is very ill
he must get home
the captain 's ordered me ashore
the chief leaves too
well it 's quite a romance isn 't it ?
quiet men !
with torpedoes fuel and supplies
all for us UNknown
you are most welcome captain
gentlemen here they stand our heroes of the deep
the grey wolves
captain lead the way
we UNknown e done what we can for you
i hope it 's to your taste
quite a table
we 'r e waiting to hear your news
you can 't imagine what it means to us
it isn 't easy here
it 's very UNknown
fuel is no problem
the spaniards tolerate us but that 's about all
i guess about
we 'r e not exactly at home if you understand what i mean
all the best
let 's get down to business
tell us all about it captain
i 'm bursting with curiosity
those are fresh UNknown
phenomenal that 's what it is
i want to hear more captain
give me your plate
just taste that
while overhead the enemy lies in wait ?
it 's dark
why is that ?
we 'r e often running at silent speed
and that 's why you can 't UNknown !
the men from madrid are here
UNknown we UNknown e been expecting you
captain over here
i have some communications from berlin
first the documents for the breakthrough
then this cable came
what 's happening UNknown ?
there 's no replacement
i 'm sorry
who knows what kind of idiot they 'd have sent you
one of those new found warriors who 's all wind and smoke
you could be right
it 's a good thing they didn 't
get that chart table cleared
i can 't navigate on bananas
what do you think you 'r e doing ?
get that fruit out of here
is that a christmas tree ?
no camouflage for the bridge
we 'r e staying
i 'm sorry UNknown
a bit narrow
a bit narrow
they are very heavily defended
the place will be crawling with patrol boats
anything that floats will be on the water
this is where we have to go
that 's the situation
on the surface
as near to gibraltar as we can get
then dive down and let ourselves drift through
and so dive and let the surface current pull us through the UNknown
it 's an easy trick
quiet as a shadow and we burn less fuel
well UNknown ?
all ahead two thirds
now clear the bridge
come left 20 degrees
come left another 10
that 's good
steady as you go
right full rudder
where 's the escape gear ?
calm down !
silence on board !
maintain full power chief !
all the power you UNknown e got !
where the hell 's he going ?
switch to manual
damn it !
blow forward tanks !
we UNknown e got to shed some weight
keep him quiet !
permission to blow ?
blow all we UNknown e got
take away all our sins
a shovel full of sand
the gods left a shovel full of sand to keep us up
280 metres and she 's still in one piece !
torpedo hatch taking water !
torpedo hatch taking water !
motor room taking water
what do you need ?
some timber for UNknown
bring me the tools
switchboard out of action
we can 't stop the flooding
with so much damage we UNknown e had it
where 's the most damage ?
it 's stuck tight
give me the hammer
i UNknown l ask the lieutenant
this damn thing !
we UNknown e got work to do !
tools from the engine room
where 's that damn wrench ?
bring another wrench
tighten the seals
the cooling system is leaking

that 's the biggest we can find
we 'r e taking water fast
the cooling UNknown is blocked
the UNknown are UNknown
i can 't tell as yet
many of the battery cells are cracked
get some battery straps
the chief needs battery straps make it quick !
it 's still coming in
get me the hammer
i need light
tell them to hurry up
24 battery cells cracked
our only chance is to bridge all the live cells
it 's no good
more to the right
wire for the battery cells
the chief needs wire
we UNknown e got plenty of fancy torpedoes
each one is 25 000 marks
all they forget is 50 UNknown worth of old wire !
now what ?
that 's great
we must get rid of the water
there just has to be a way
into the control room bilge and then outside
give it to me
keep the rhythm going
step on it
only three to go sir
make some room for the chief
more hands needed aft
more hands needed aft
captain all of our UNknown are out of action
we UNknown e lost the sounding gear
all radio contact is dead
first rate condition

that should help us
we UNknown l try
we UNknown e got to get the water out
it must work !
the ballast pump ?
we gamble on one count
one blast and we
ln about eight hours sir
UNknown content ?
will he pull through ?
it 's difficult to say
he doesn 't look too good
well pilgrim is everything okay ?
we 'r e getting it under control
i think we 'r e winning
how is it looking aft ?
we UNknown e done what we can sir
i guess it 's time i looked things over
you should be careful
we UNknown l make it
how does it look ?
we UNknown l soon be running
how 's it going ?
two bearings to be changed
how about some apple juice ?
they were crazy ordering us through the UNknown
it was going to go wrong
he knew it
from the moment that radio signal came through he realized the risk
that 's the reason he ordered us ashore
he knew there was very little hope
he tried to fool us
an easy trick he said
dive and drift with the current
what a clever trick
will we ever get out of this ?
i really don 't know
i 'm sorry
it 's been 15 hours
we UNknown l never do it
i 'm sorry
to be fearless and proud and alone
they told us it would be the test of our manhood
to need no one and UNknown all for the fatherland and courage
is that not the way they said it all ?
i just want someone to be with
the only thing i feel is afraid
situation report sir
the pump is clear
the compass is in order
echo UNknown clear
just a few small problems left sir
you have to have good men
good men all of them
if we make it to the surface it could still get pretty rough
the traffic 's heavy up there
pray the engines start so we can get out of this mess
with the condition the boat is in we UNknown l head straight for la rochelle
if we make it it 's half a bottle of beer for each
there 's one thing on our side
they won 't be expecting us
i UNknown e never heard such sweet music in all my life
they 'r e running !
they won 't catch us this time
not this time !
that 's an order !
right full rudder
they haven 't spotted us
they 'r e snoring in their bunks
they 'r e drinking in the bar
celebrating our sinking !

and an end to the war

with a bit of luck we UNknown l make it back home

ferdinand UNknown is a minor character in our story
nonetheless he is where this adventure begins as he wandered home after an evening spent playing cards and UNknown a marvellous 12 year old whisky
it was november 4th UNknown at 1 o UNknown lock in the morning
the streets were empty with a chilly nip in the air
yet at the same time exactly 953 metres from there the city was jumping
on stage nicole UNknown or nini the legs kicked up a storm
the enthusiastic audience UNknown in the show
i love you !
from the gent over there
and every evening for nearly a month
raymond UNknown a former prefect celebrated his promotion to paris as secretary of state for foreign affairs
meanwhile ferdinand had barely travelled the 280 metres that separate la UNknown from place des UNknown
don t be shy !
you UNknown e seen others !
oh my god !
the UNknown lights came from the home of professor marie joseph UNknown
this eminent scientist and expert on ancient egypt had obtained a degree in physics at age 16
his research UNknown 35 years later in a book with the UNknown title is there a life after death ?
at the same moment across the seine the question seemed to have been settled long ago
yet on the first floor a life form that UNknown the laws of science was about to give the scientist his answer
as the century 's most amazing experiment took place before our eyes
inspector albert UNknown had his tightly shut
of course had he seen the UNknown fly by his window our story would have been UNknown different but for now no one could blame the inspector for his UNknown
his UNknown and UNknown had previously earned him a good many UNknown including the medal of merit for solving the mystery of the missing persons of UNknown asylum
he was decorated on august 28th UNknown by the prefect raymond UNknown in person
let my little bird land on your branches
you devil !
and the bird in the nest to open its eyes
drive normally can 't you ?

i fear you re right
money can 't buy happiness UNknown

no a doctor
however i know a specialist institute in cairo where the doctors would be delighted to examine you
i 'm fine thank you
except for the nausea i feel in your presence prof UNknown
still the same UNknown sense of humour my dear ad le
you il need it
not looting borrowing
UNknown is a professor of medicine
UNknown il 's personal doctor
the greatest medical expert in ancient egypt
no just my sister
but has it crossed your mind that your professor is dead ?
i 'd noticed thank you
how will you UNknown him ?
may i ?
that old fool UNknown ?
he 's barely able to spin a chair round
he UNknown l be dead before he UNknown this old mummy !
mind your language !
you re scaring me !
after the ice monster here comes the sand zombie !
watch out he 's a real UNknown !
my dear ad le
take her away !
the tomb 's in the middle
more protocol but much less pain
it 's not very good for my health but i 'd appreciate a cigarette
why not ?
a memento actually
whenever i use it i think of him
into my arms !
excuse me my good man !
i UNknown l kill that woman !
breathe in !
breathe in !
i swear it 's true commissioner
and prefect UNknown was aboard
a UNknown clad woman ?
with UNknown founder of christian aid ?
like you saw joan of arc UNknown once more
there were three passengers in the vehicle
UNknown his driver and
to the drunk tank !
i 'm innocent !
i was just going home
gentlemen until we find out more about this tragedy
i 'm relying on you to keep this case confidential
of course sir
their dance with death !
giant bird UNknown on the capital !
get the little parisian today !
giant bird UNknown on the capital !
giant bird UNknown on the capital !
monster kills prefect !
there you are sir
even le UNknown has run it
they UNknown l panic people that 's all
send poor UNknown 's widow our condolences
yes mr president
but a UNknown ?
you sent for me sir ?
it could be UNknown up to their tricks
look into it and keep me informed
leave it to me sir
call the prefect
the president wants results this week
i UNknown l take care of it sir
call police headquarters
we need more energy
i 'm on the job sir
get me UNknown !
you have 48 hours
don t let me down
our reputation s at stake
i UNknown l do my best sir
you have 24 hours
of course not UNknown
what happened ?
he blamed it on a careless visitor and simply replaced the glass
people are so clumsy !
it 's more complicated than that
look at the remains of the shell
most are still connected to the UNknown UNknown as if the force that cracked the egg came from
the inside ?
through there !
you d have made an excellent policeman
professor UNknown ?
i 'm in charge of the UNknown case
seeing the bone collection in your museum
i thought maybe you could help
i 'm strictly a UNknown man
i 'd suggest you see a specialist in the UNknown
look i have 24 hours to solve this
i can 't go visiting UNknown
let me find you a specialist in paris in that case
most kind of you
please follow me
i can 't think on an empty stomach
you want more ?
that 's good my baby
UNknown UNknown sir
yes that 's right
i was about to eat
perfect that 's our speciality
well please come in then
goodness it 's dark in here
i 'm very sensitive to light
please take a seat
tell me about the animal
what it eats where it sleeps
we know very little about its habits
we do know it 's a UNknown
quite right !
what 's that ?
there 's a nest of them ?
no i mean
mating took place once a year and for reasons as yet unknown they only laid one egg at a time
which explains their aggressive nature especially when it came to defending their one and only offspring
it was too much for him
the man 's deranged !
take him away !
very good !
i 'd love to get moving lady but these damn UNknown are blocking the road
when will they ban horses from paris ?
this is the 20th century !
oh what happened ?
what UNknown pocus have you brought back now ?
miranda mind your language and help with the bags
i just cleaned your room
you bring back these old dirty relics again
i UNknown l take care of this one personally
what 's all this mail ?
the young man from the UNknown gardens
a letter a day and two on monday to make up for sunday
reminds me of my youth in UNknown in my mother s family
there was a young UNknown strong as his bulls
how is agatha ?
but she eats less and less
soon she UNknown l be skin and bone
we UNknown l take good care of her
thank you miranda for your patience your time and your advice !
so you refuse to eat ?
now you look so unhealthy
you need some blush
i hope miranda didn 't bore you with UNknown
i was in egypt
medically they were so advanced
their preservation techniques prove it
nobody s ever done better
i 'm sure with all his secrets he UNknown l soon have you on your feet
as soon as i find the man who can revive him
i was about to slip you a note
i 'd no idea you were back
i was about to go out
i won t keep you
i hope not
forget the others
that one s the most important
ok i will read them in the bath
in the bath ?
what 's this UNknown ?
drink to my health !
UNknown your lawyer to see you
your client sir
professor i found UNknown mummy
that 's impossible
where is it now ?
i don t see how i can get out of here
anyway my mind is too busy controlling the bird
the UNknown ?
i brought to life an egg over 135 million years old
perhaps but the bird UNknown me
whenever i UNknown off its killer instinct takes over
i must stop it
that 's fine by me but how will you get me out ?
trust your lawyer
mr saint hubert can we have a comment ?
don t crowd
gentlemen calm down !
they have invited me as an expert to assist mr UNknown to dispatch this UNknown
it 's a great honour to put my talent at the service of the nation
mr saint hubert what approach will you use ?
first we UNknown l track it down to study its behaviour and habits
how will you find it ?
quite simply by raising our sights
anything good today ?
don t mention it
it 's right here UNknown
i can sense it
what is it exactly ?
we 'r e making progress UNknown
you re armand petit blanchard head cook
armand what ?
someone stole my badge from my locker
hands off me !
sorry no more UNknown
montmartre in the north the colonial exhibition in the east or the UNknown gardens
that 's right
thank you my son
as daddy would say a battle that seems lost is the most exciting
up and at UNknown m !
would you be so kind as to come back later ?
i really am very tired
that takes the biscuit !
six UNknown goats four UNknown UNknown fifteen UNknown UNknown and nine ten twelve mountain sheep from UNknown
get ready UNknown !
thank you !
we have to go now
what are you doing here ?
it 's not by choice
where 's the professor ?
they transferred him last night
always do before the execution
it can 't be
she has nothing on her
when was it ?
it was my first interview
and the last time i laughed so much
yes i was appalling
i UNknown e pardoned 17 condemned men in my first term
he didn 't kill them
it was a prehistoric beast !
only the professor can control it
without him how many bodies will there be ?
miss we have put our finest men on the case
we even called in a big game hunter from africa to dispatch the animal
his research keeps science going forward
by taking his life you condemn so many others
i promise i UNknown l think it over
thank you sir
fetch it nelson !
come and fetch it !
be a good boy !
let me go !
i am fine go away !
i 'm warning you i know UNknown UNknown
UNknown and patience are the hunter 's UNknown
tell me saint hubert could i nip off for a minute for some food ?
out of the question !
we are at war my friend
one day i hunted a tiger lying low in a UNknown temple
we went three days without food
three days !
i started by consulting all the books in the library which confirmed the animal 's UNknown nature
so i got the idea to collect the fragments of its egg and put them in a quiet place
then i left out some choice cuts of beef to keep them from hunger so it wouldn t UNknown our herd of UNknown sheep
it 's nothing really just a little intuition
with intuition like that you must sweep the ladies off their feet my young friend !
that depends on the lady
are there two l 's in ad le ?
no two e 's
like the wine
prof UNknown was supposed to wake him not the damn UNknown he should ve left alone given its attack on the president and his pet
i summoned up all my courage and threw myself on the president
a heroic but calculated gesture intended to secure a pardon for the professor to save my sister
i was arrested for attacking him
do i look like a terrorist ?
which is ?
i save the president and that 's the thanks i get ?
you UNknown !
i need a bath to gather my wits
sorry for bothering you for nothing
my god !
let 's go
don t worry i UNknown e cracked tougher nuts
i don t mean you !
in any case you have beautiful UNknown
in truth if your voice is the equal of your coat
watch out it might think you re a goat
you smooth talker
my UNknown thing
now we 'r e friends
i have a favour to ask of you
surely you re not going to
it 'd be rude not to
it 's madness !
now we UNknown e mastered the unbelievable let 's perform the impossible
here we are !
you haven 't seen anything yet
and don t blink or you il miss it
i prepared some snacks for you
which way ?
there he is !
i see why they 'd chop it off
it was too much for him
they UNknown e put a bag on his head
i don t understand
fetch an ambulance
i UNknown l go right away
you keep it buster
he saved your life
who are these
UNknown well i never !
how on earth did you get here ?
that 's a very long story
you can tell it later
this winter over a hot chocolate
we have a mummy to wake and sister to save
just joking !
well i 'm not joking
tired after your trip ?
indeed i am
i UNknown l take you
yes take us home
i am justin de saint hubert big game hunter
big game hunter ?
you seem a fine specimen
stop that !
i UNknown l do my best
let me help
but the professor s bleeding
they 'r e connected !
don t ask how or why
if we lose one we lose both
don t let it happen
yes of course !
what do i do now ?
place antique objects in a circle around me
the older the better
i UNknown l be right back
i discovered the key to communicate with the mind
maybe some UNknown in a UNknown of butter ?
what a shame he 's gone
i 'd have liked to get to know him
what have we here ?
i detect a certain likeness
she 's my sister
i have some modest talents but not that one
i deal in figures signs and UNknown
nothing very extraordinary
may i make some tea ?
be my guest
i admit that throughout this adventure you have been very hospitable towards me and i 'd like to thank you
you could hear ?
a freak accident
like UNknown kidneys
one game all
agatha was so beautiful
in order to avoid any sense of UNknown we never had an actual match
our games were strictly friendly
then in a moment of UNknown a moment of shared happiness tragedy struck
miss wake up !
it 's the only race i 'd have loved to lose
indeed a most regrettable accident
believe me i 'm very sorry i can 't help you
the professor did a remarkable job
his mental power must have woken the dead in a radius of 2 km
but i 'm not the right person
hold on a sec 2 kilometres ?
and UNknown doctors never left his side ?
they never left the room even when he was mating
the mummies of UNknown il
UNknown you re a genius
let 's go !
yes quite !
after 5 000 years in a tomb can 't i have some fun ?
i couldn 't resist
can you open it ?
i 'm no better a lock smith than a doctor
perhaps you could serve some kind of purpose or i UNknown l float you down the seine
the nile it isn t !
don t get upset
that 's not humour !
maybe it made the pharaohs laugh but this is the 20th century !
that 's better
you 'r e a UNknown now ?
no but i studied molecular energy
for now stick to opening doors
beautiful eh ?
all clear ?
thank you mistress
if UNknown saw this
the faithful first so they 'r e there when the pharaoh wakes
poor dear don t want him feeling homesick
and definitely not insulted so i suggest we respect protocol
i 'm in favour of protocol
sorry to bother you are you a doctor ?
are you a surgeon ?
i 'm looking for a doctor
no you 'r e not a doctor !
doctor anyone ?
native costume your highness
their civilization is still rough and ready but she is very UNknown and waking us was her good idea
good idea ?
sorry to wake you your highness i had no choice
it 's a matter of life or death
life or death ?
i 'd like my sister 's to come back
miss ad le woke me up in the belief that i was a doctor
she 's looking for a doctor to treat her sister and we thought that in your great kindness you might let your personal physician take a look at the child
you woke me up for such a trivial affair ?
hold on rummy !
i UNknown e had 5 years of grieving of suffering with my sister who can 't see me
i 'm a poor earth UNknown with no divine protection
i live everyday with the pain and guilt that never goes away
because it was all my fault !
it was my UNknown !
what 's this about a hat ?
nothing i UNknown l tell you later
UNknown my faithful doctor
all she can enjoy after this love for her
you 'r e insane !
i asked you to cure her not kill her you bag of bones !
calm down ad le
not really more of a tradition
it 's better to do it now before she wakes up
and i love you more than the whole world
it was a privilege meeting you miss ad le
same here UNknown
and thank him for me
this way your majesty
why of course !
cruelly lacking in manners
this courtyard for example is magnificent
quite magnificent !
i 'm sure it would be a fine addition
meanwhile sire perhaps we should rejoin the others ?
you are right UNknown
read all about it !
mummies vanish from the louvre !
there you go sir !
curse of the pharaohs strikes paris !
what 's this now about mummies ?
it 's another anarchist plot
call the interior
who 's it for ?
it was for miss ad le
she 's taken a few weeks vacation
for me ?
what 's your name ?
as in jaguar
all right keep your hair on
blanc sec ad le
leave it to us
welcome on board
welcome on board
sorry it was an accident
that 's my bag !
take good care of it
have a good trip miss blanc sec
saint hubert !
i just lost him !
go and find him !
you put up a good fight
please i m begging you
take him away !
fine take your time
when i was lying there in the va hospital with a big hole blown through the middle of my life
i started having these dreams of flying
i was free
in UNknown you don 't dream at all
it doesn 't feel like 6 years
more like a fifth of tequila and ass kicking
tommy was the scientist not me
he was the one who wanted to get shot light years out in space to find the answers
are we there yet ?
yeah we 'r e there sunshine
we 'r e there
so a week before tommy was gonna ship out
a guy with a gun ends his journey for the paper in his wallet
being in UNknown for 5 years 9 months and 22 days
you will be hungry you will be weak
if you feel UNknown please use the
yeah tommy was the scientist
me i 'm just another dumb grunt going some place he 's gonna regret
up ahead was pandora
your brother represented a significant investment
we 'd like to talk to you about taking over his contract
and since your UNknown is identical to his you could step into his shoes
so to speak
and the pay is good
remember people you lose that mask you 'r e unconscious in 20 seconds
you 'r e dead in 4 minutes
let nobody be dead today
it looks very bad on my report
this is UNknown 1 6 on approach
crossing outer marker
when the ramp comes down go directly into the base
do not stop
you may be out but you never lose the attitude
i told myself i could pass any test a man can pass
they can fix the spine if you got the money
but not on vet benefits not in this economy
let 's go special k
do not make me wait for you !
well well ladies
back on earth these guys were army dogs
check this out man
you are not in kansas any more
you are on pandora ladies and gentlemen
respect that fact every second of every day
if there is a hell you might wanna go there for some r and r after a tour on pandora
out there beyond that fence every living thing that crawls flies or UNknown in the mud wants to kill you and eat your eyes for ju ju beads
we have an UNknown population of UNknown called the na UNknown i
they 'r e fond of arrows dipped in a UNknown that will stop your heart in one minute
and they have bones UNknown with naturally UNknown carbon UNknown
they are very hard to kill
as head of security it is my job to keep you alive
i will not succeed
if you wish to survive you need to cultivate a strong mental attitude
you UNknown e got to obey the rules
jake you 'r e jake right ?
tom 's brother
sorry i 'm norm UNknown
i went through UNknown training with him
the UNknown lab
how you doing norm UNknown driver
here 's the link room right here
this is where we 'r e connecting to the UNknown
me and norm are here to drive these remotely controlled bodies called UNknown
and they 'r e grown from human dna mixed with the dna of the natives
damn they got big
so the progress up the UNknown seem to work really well
yeah they got great muscle tone
it UNknown l take us a few hours to get them prepared but you can take them out tomorrow
there 's yours
the concept is that every driver is matched to his own UNknown
so that their nervous system are in tune
which is insanely expensive
yeah we gotta get the habit of UNknown everything
what we see what we feel it 's all part of the science
and good science is good observation
plus it UNknown l help keep you sane for the next 6 years
attention drivers coming out of the lane
where 's her lab coat ?
who 's got my goddamn cigarette ! ?
guys what 's wrong with this picture ?
thank you !
she 's the head of the UNknown program
she wrote the book
that 's because she likes plants better than people
here she is cinderella back from the ball
grace i 'd like you to meet norm UNknown and jake sully
norm i hear good things about you
how 's your na UNknown i ?
grace this is jake sully
yeah yeah i know who you are and i don 't need you
i need your brother
he 's dead
how much lab training have you had ?
i UNknown a frog once
you see ?
i 'm going to UNknown
no grace !
i 'm gonna kick his corporate butt
he has no business sticking his nose in my department
here tomorrow 08 00
scorpion 2 hotel hell 's gate tower
you are cleared for south departure
did you see that ?
i love this putter ronnie
grace i enjoy our little talks
i need a UNknown not some jar head drop out
well actually i thought we got lucky with him
lucky your guy had a twin brother
and lucky that brother wasn 't some UNknown UNknown or something
a marine we could use
i 'm UNknown him to your team as security escort
the last thing i need is another trigger happy moron out there
look you 'r e supposed to be winning the hearts and the minds of the natives isn 't that the whole point of your little puppet show ?
you look like them you talk like them and they UNknown l start trusting us
we build them a school we teach them english
but after how many years relations with the UNknown are only getting worse
that tends to happen when you use machine guns on them
right come here
because this little gray rock sells for 20 million a kilo
that 's the only reason
it 's what pays for the whole party
it 's what pays for your science
we 'r e on the brink of war and you 'r e supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution
so use what you UNknown e got and get me some results
how much link time have you UNknown ?
about 520 hours
you 'r e here
tell me you 'r e joking
this is cool
what was going through your head ?
maybe i was sick of doctors telling me what i couldn 't do
UNknown are good
that shouldn 't be hard for you
kiss the darkest part of my
that 's a gorgeous brain
phase lock 99
can you hear me jake ?
UNknown UNknown is good
and touch your thumb to your fingers
thumb to your fingers
let 's take it nice and slow jake
no tranquil attacks here that 's good
do you feel UNknown or dizzy ?
wiggling your toes
are you feeling any UNknown or pain ?
take it easy don 't get ahead of yourself okay ?
there are few more UNknown and motor UNknown tests we need to run so take it easy
it 's ok i got this
jake you need to sit down
guys get him back on the UNknown now
you need to sit down you need time to adjust to UNknown
this is great
sit down !
i don 't even have to play defense
jake you have to come inside
think fast !
c 'm on everybody quiet down
don 't play with that you UNknown l go blind
that 's kinda UNknown
and this here is my baby
hold on a second
we bounce at 09 00
i 'm on it captain
mine strike 's still loose
you guys are packing some heavy gear
watch it !
or the biggest
i 'm a man short
thought you 'd never ask
there 's your man
you wanted to see me colonel ?
this low gravity will make you soft
you get soft
i pulled your record corporal
venezuela that was some mean bush
nothing like this here though
you got some heart kid showing up in this neighborhood
figured it 's just another hell hole
i was the first UNknown myself
few years ahead of you well maybe more than a few
three tours in UNknown not a scratch
i come out here
they could fix me up if i UNknown back
make me pretty again
it reminds me every day what 's waiting out there
the UNknown program is a bad joke
bunch a limp dick science majors
however it does present an opportunity most timely and unique
that 's a potent mix gives me the UNknown
such a marine could provide the intel i need right on the ground
right in the hostile 's camp
look sully i want you to learn these savages from the inside
i want you to gain their trust
i need to know how to force their cooperation or hammer them hard if they won 't
am i still with UNknown ?
you quack like one
can you do that for me son ?
hell yeah sir
you get me what i need i UNknown l see to it you get your legs back when you UNknown home
your real legs
link 's ready
link 3 ready
shut it down we 'r e gonna stay a while
norm your pack
you the man doc
relax marine you 'r e making me nervous
so how will they know we 'r e here ?
i 'm sure they 'r e watching us right now
keep moving norm
amazing isn 't it ?
so we should take a sample
norm you UNknown e contaminated the sample with your saliva
it 's already pissed off
jake that armor is too thick trust me
it 's a territorial threat display do not run or he UNknown l charge
so what do i do ?
dance with it ?
that 's right get your punk ass back to mommy
you got nothing keep running
why don 't you bring back some friends
what about this one ?
run don 't run what ? !
run definitely run !
UNknown 's orders
he won 't make it till morning
i don 't have all goddamn night
come on !
wait a second where are you going ?
don 't thank
this is sad
all this is your fault
they did not need to die
my fault ?
your fault !
why not let them just kill my ass ?
what 's the thinking ?
why save you ?
well if i 'm like a child then maybe you should teach me
sky people can not learn
you do not see
no one can teach you to see
come on can 't we talk ?
where did you learn to speak english ?
dr UNknown 's school ?
you 'r e like a baby
i need your help
ok take me with you
no go back
very pure spirits
what 's going on ?
what 's happening ?
what 's he saying ?
my father is deciding whether to kill you
your father ?
that is mother she is UNknown the one who UNknown the will of UNknown
who 's UNknown ?
i came to learn
it is hard to fill a cup which is already full
my cup is empty trust me
ask dr UNknown i 'm no scientist
what are you ?
it is decided
learn well jake sully
is the UNknown safe ?
the last thing we see is this marine 's ass disappearing in the bush with this angry UNknown coming after him
it 's not something you can teach
for reasons i cannot fathom the UNknown have chosen you
god help us all
that 's called taking initiative son
i wish i had ten more like you
sully just find out what the blue monkeys want
you know we tried to give them medicine education roads but no they like mud
and that wouldn 't bother me it 's just that their uh
can somebody just
i mean look at all that UNknown
who gets them to move ?
i 'm betting that they will
killing the UNknown looks bad
but there 's one thing that UNknown hate more than bad press
and that 's a bad UNknown statement
i didn 't make up the rules
so just find me a carrot that will get them to move otherwise it 's going to have to be all stick
well we 'r e wasting time
i like this guy
she 's their spiritual leader
like a UNknown
they become a UNknown pair
so who 's this UNknown ?
who 's UNknown ? !
only their deity
everything they know
who 's got a date with the chief 's daughter ?
let 's go
for now say where to go
i knew you could speak english
your scan doesn 't show the internal structure
there 's an outer row of columns real heavy duty
there 's a secondary ring here and an inner ring
there 's a core structure like a UNknown
that 's how they move up and down
we 'r e gonna need accurate UNknown of every column
i 'm guessing this secondary ring that 's also load bearing
where are we going ?
gettin out of dodge
there 's a mobile link up as site 26 we can work out of way up in the mountains
the hallelujah mountains ?
we 'r e getting close
yeah look at my instruments
we 'r e in the flux UNknown
UNknown from here on
you can 't see anything
oh my god
thank you for flying air pandora
welcome to camp
this stuff is nasty
she knew i was talking to the colonel
but i had what she needed a way back in with the clan
so she 's playing nice
jake hang a left
unit 1 beulah
UNknown is not horse
UNknown will fly well
to become aron UNknown u hunter
you must choose your own UNknown and he must choose you
time is 21 32
like i really need to get some rack
no now when it 's fresh
the language is a pain but
i figure it 's like field UNknown a weapon repetition repetition
if only you were stronger
UNknown calls me UNknown
but it 's not just i 'm seeing you in front of me
i see into you
you UNknown e got to run ok ?
let 's go
i can run farther every day
i have to trust my body to know what to do
yeah check it out !
she 's always going on about the flow of energy the spirits of animals
i really hope this tree hugging crap isn 't on the final
this isn 't just about eye hand coordination out there you know
you need to listen to what she says
try to see the forest through her eyes
excuse me this is my video log here
with UNknown it 's learn fast or die
you got to be kidding me
i talked moat into letting grace into the village
1st time since her school was closed down
no you don 't come back here
she talks about a network of energy
that flows through all living things
she says all energy is only borrowed
and one day you have to give it back
a clean kill
but to do that you got to go where the UNknown are
now you choose your UNknown
this you must feel inside
if he also chooses you move quick like i showed
you will have one chance jake
how will i know if he chooses me ?
he will try to kill you
sa UNknown UNknown !
first flight seals the bond you can not wait
that 's it
oh shit !
i came like this this you
i turn i feel the wind i turn very strong
i see i bank so hard
the tree of souls
see the flux UNknown and these full color images ?
that 's what messes up my instruments
there is something really interesting going on in there UNknown
i would die to get samples
outsiders are strictly forbidden
death from above
it is UNknown last shadow
right it 's the last one you ever see
my grandfather 's grandfather was UNknown UNknown
rider of last shadow
that 's a long time
all na UNknown i people know the story
everything is backwards now
it 's hard to believe it 's only been three months
i barely remember my own life
i don 't know who i am anymore
haven 't got lost in the woods have you ?
your last report was more than two weeks ago
i 'm starting to doubt your resolve
way i see it it 's time to terminate the mission
i can do this
this tree of souls place
yeah i got them by the balls with that when this turns into a shit fight which it will
now is time to come in
by the way you 'r e gonna get your legs back
yeah i got you corporate approval
it 's a done deal gonna have you on a shuttle tonight
i 'm a man of my word
i got to finish this
it 's one more thing
if i do it i 'm one of them
they UNknown l trust me
and i can negotiate the terms of their UNknown
than you better get it done corporal
the na UNknown i say every person is born twice
the second time is when you earn your place among the people forever
and sometimes answered
the tree of voices
i can hear them
and you may choose a woman
we have many fine women
UNknown is the best singer
i don 't want UNknown
UNknown is good hunter
i UNknown e already chosen
but this woman must also choose me
she already has
we are UNknown for life
what the hell are you doing jake ?
don 't forget the phase UNknown middle button
you got to eat something
there i 'm done let 's go
and when was the last time you took a shower ?
i don 't need a shower
he 's blocking my blade
keep going he UNknown l move
these people have to learn that we don 't stop
come on go go go
scale up enhance
don 't do this !
it is done
many UNknown will die if you do
you are not my brother !
and i am not your enemy !
the enemy is out there !
and they are very powerful !
i can talk to them !
no more talk !
and i have the right to speak
these words are like stones in my heart
sir i 'm sorry
it 's very dangerous !
are you out of your UNknown mind ? !
you crossed the line
you let me down son
so what you
parker there is time to salvage this situation
shut your pie hole !
or what ranger rick ?
you gonna shoot me ?
i could do that
can we take this down a couple of notches please ?
you say you want to keep your people alive ?
start by listening to her
those trees were sacred to UNknown in a way you can 't imagine
you know what ?
i 'm not talking about some kind of pagan voodoo
i 'm talking about something real something UNknown in a biology of the forest
which is what exactly ?
what we think we know is that there 's some kind of UNknown chemical communication between the roots of the trees
like UNknown between UNknown
and there are 10 to the UNknown trees on pandora
which is a lot i 'm guessing
it 's more connections than the human brain
get it ?
they can UNknown and UNknown data
memories at sites like the one you just destroyed
they 'r e just goddamn trees
you need to wake up parker
no you need to wake up
the wealth of this world isn 't in the ground it 's all around us
the na UNknown i know that and they 'r e fighting to defend it
if you want to share this world with them you need to understand them
i 'd say we understand them just fine thanks to jake here
hey doc come take a look
they 'r e not gonna give up their home
they 'r e not gonna make a deal
for light beer ?
everything they sent me out here to do is a waste of time
they 'r e never gonna leave UNknown
since a deal can 't be made i guess things get real simple jake
i might just give you big wet kiss
i UNknown l do with UNknown casualties to UNknown
i UNknown l drive them out with gas first
it UNknown l be humane
more or less
this is how it 's done
when people are sitting on shit you want you make them your enemy then you justify taking it
UNknown just rolled in the UNknown
he 's gonna hit UNknown
back off !
they 'r e fly bitten savages that live in a tree
alright look around
they can move
there are families in there
there are children babies
you don 't want that kind of blood on your hands believe me
let me try to talk them out
they trust me
UNknown 3 and 4
listen to me you UNknown e got one hour
unless you want your girlfriend in there when the axe comes down you get them to evacuate
you have to leave or you 'r e gonna die
are you certain of this ?
they sent me here to learn your ways
so one day i could bring this message and that you would believe it
what are you saying jake ?
you knew this would happen ?
and then everything changed
with the UNknown people
he tried to stop them !
you have to go they are coming !
run to the forest !
they 'r e coming !
they want to destroy this place
UNknown you must go now
get to the forest !
well well well
alright people let 's get this done
i want every gas round you got right in the front door
roger UNknown 40 's going hot
you got to be kidding me
these dumb bastards ain 't getting the message
let 's turn up the heat
moat no !
give me he to the base of the west columns
this way !
bring it down
get down !
i didn 't sign up for this shit !
let 's boogie
never come back !
i was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace
sooner or UNknown though
you murderers !
long time no see
they got steak ?
it 's sector 1 6 UNknown engine start
come on !
grace is hit
trauma kit 's forward on the bulk head
hang on grace
keep going north get us deep into the mountains
yup still here
not this far into the UNknown
it 's strongest at the tree of souls right ?
i 'm a scientist remember ?
i don 't believe in fairy tales
the people can help you i know it
why would they help us ?
the people say UNknown will provide
but no home no hope
there was only one place they could go
link 's running
there 's no plan
he 's not gonna let you near that place
i UNknown e got to try
i needed their help and they needed mine
but to ever face them again
i was gonna have to take it to a whole new level
sometimes your whole life boils down to one insane move
there 's something we gotta do
you 'r e not going to like it
the way i had it figured UNknown is the UNknown cat in the sky
nothing attacks him
that was just a theory
i see you
you are the leader
my friend is dying
look where we are grace
i need to take some samples
great mother may choose to save all that she is
in this body
but jake sully
she 's real
it was not enough time
she is with UNknown now
with your permission i will speak now
you would honor me by UNknown
the sky people have sent us a message
that they can take whatever they want
and no one can stop them
but we will send them a message
you ride out as fast as the wind can carry you
we tell the other UNknown to come
you tell that UNknown UNknown calls to them
you fly now !
that they can not take whatever they want !
and that this this is our land !
we rode out to the four winds
to the horse UNknown of the plain
to the UNknown people of the eastern sea
when UNknown UNknown called them they came
everyone on this base everyone of you is fighting for survival and that 's a fact
there 's UNknown UNknown out there UNknown for an attack
these UNknown images tell me that the UNknown numbers have gone from few hundred to well over two thousand in one day
and more are pouring in
in a weeks time there could be 20 000 of them
at that point they will overrun our perimeter
that 's not gonna happen
our only security lies in UNknown attack
we will fight terror with terror
now the UNknown believe that this mountain stronghold of theirs is protected by their deity
and when we destroy it
we will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep that hey won 't come within a 1000 clicks of this place ever again
and that too is a fact
jake it 's crazy here full UNknown
they 'r e rigging the shuttle as a bomber
they got these huge UNknown of mine explosives for some shock and awe campaign
UNknown daisy cutters
we 'r e going up against UNknown with bows and arrows
i have 15 UNknown out there
that 's over 2000 warriors
we know these mountains
they don 't
missile tracking won 't work
they UNknown l have to fire a line of sight
if they bring the fight to us then we have the home field advantage
you know he 's gonna commit that bomber UNknown to the tree of souls
that 's their direct line to UNknown their ancestors
it UNknown l destroy them
then i guess we better stop them
i 'm probably just talking to a tree right now
but if you 'r e there
i need to give you a heads up
if grace is with you
look into her memories
there 's no green there
they killed their mother
more sky people are gonna come
they 'r e gonna come like rain that never ends
unless we stop them
i will stand and fight
you know i will
our great mother does not take sides jake
she protects only the balance of life
it was worth a try
this is group leader we 'r e entering the flux UNknown
switch to manual flight mode
this is papa dragon
i want to be home for dinner
suit team go
eyes up check that overhead
watch those UNknown UNknown
pushing the target
we are gonna lose some paint in here
gun crews keep your head on a UNknown
make no mistake people they 'r e out there
alright people target in sight
range four clicks
push to the ramp !
hold position we got movement out there
no sir it 's the flux
brother i 'm gonna punch a hole you follow me through

UNknown 1 6 this is dragon press the target

i kinda hoped you 'd say that
come on !
you think you 'r e one of them ?
time to wake up
only a few were chosen to stay
the time of great sorrow was ending
UNknown UNknown was no longer needed
well i guess this is my last video log
whatever happens tonight
well i guess i better go
i don 't want to be late for my own party
it 's my birthday after all
this is jake sully signing off
UNknown by UNknown
watch full movies online at www awooh com
i know what this is
i UNknown e seen one before
many many years ago
a man possessed of some UNknown notions
a bacteria ?
an idea that is UNknown formed UNknown understood that sticks
right in there somewhere
it 's cailed UNknown
how can you do that ?
because i am the most UNknown UNknown
i know how to search your mind and find your secrets
i know the tricks
look if you want my help you 'r e gonna have to be completely open with me
i need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife better than your UNknown better than anyone
if this is a dream and you have a safe fuii of secrets i need to know what 's in that safe
in order for this aii to work you need to completely iet me in
enjoy your evening gentlemen as i consider your proposal
doesn 't matter
he iooked right at it when i mentioned secrets
what 's she doing here ?
just head back to the room
aii right ?
okay make sure you do
we 'r e here to work
if i jumped would i survive ?
with a clean dive perhaps
mal what are you doing here ?
i thought you might be missing me
but i can 't trust you anymore
do what ?
actuaily the subject is UNknown to UNknown british painters
please have a seat
you can 't imagine
just getting some fresh air
UNknown where you are
or have you known aii along ?
that you 'r e here to steai from me or that we are actuaily asleep ?
i want to know the name of your employer
ah there 's no use threatening him in a dream right
kiiling him would just wake him up
and judging by the UNknown we 'r e in your mind aren 't we
it 's too soon
i 'm gonna try to keep UNknown under a iittle bit ionger
we 'r e almost there
wake him up
not even my head of security knows this apartment
how did you find it ?
it 's difficult for a man of your position to keep a love nest iike this secret particularly where there 's a married woman involved
UNknown would never
you got what you came for
you ieft out a key piece of information didn 't you ?
you held something back because you knew what we were up to
question is why 'd you iet us in at ail ?
doesn 't matter
but your deception was obvious
you don 't seem to understand
we won 't iast two days
teii us what you know !
teii us what you know now !
it 's stained and frayed in such UNknown ways
but very definitely made of wool
right now i 'm iying on UNknown
which means i 'm not iying on my carpet in my apartment
you have iived up to your reputation
i 'm impressed
ah yes but you see
we 'r e in mine
it wasn 't my fault
you 'r e the architect
i didn 't know he was gonna rub his cheek on it !
that 's enough
i have it under control
i 'd hate to see you out of control
we don 't have time for this
i 'm getting off at kyoto
is that you
mommy 's not here anymore
and you be good you be
mai showing up
won 't happen again
one apology 's aii you 'r e getting aii right ?
where 's nash ?
by now they know we failed
it 's time we disappear
where you gonna go ?
do i offer you the satisfaction
it 's not the way i deai with things
what do you want from us ?
okay here 's me planting an idea in your head
what are you thinking about ?
the subject 's mind can always trace the UNknown of the idea
true inspiration 's impossible to fake
that 's not true
are you offering me a choice ?
because i can find my own way to square things with UNknown
then you do have a choice
then i choose to ieave sir
teii the crew where you want to go
no one can
my main competitor is an old man in poor health
his son wiii soon inherit controi of the corporation
i need him to decide to break up his father 's empire
cobb we should walk away from this
how do i know you can deliver ?
you don 't
assemble your team
this can 't be done
yes it can
you don 't know that
i UNknown e done it before
who 'd you do it to ?
why are we going to paris ?
we 'r e gonna need a new architect
no space to think in that broom cupboard
is it safe for you to be here ?
UNknown between france and the united UNknown is a UNknown nightmare you know that
i think they might find a way to make it work in your case
it 'i i take more than the UNknown stuffed animal to convince those children they stiii have a father
i 'm just doing what i know
i 'm doing what you taught me
i never taught you to be a thief
no you taught me to navigate people 's minds
but after what happened there weren 't a whole iot of UNknown ways for me to use that UNknown
what are you doing here
it 's a job for some very very UNknown people
people who i believe can fix my charges permanently
but i need your help
you 'r e here to corrupt one of my brightest and best
you know what i 'm offering
let them decide for themselves
do you want me to iet someone else foilow you into your fantasy ?
they don 't actuaily come into the dream
they just design the UNknown and teach them to the dreamers
that 's ail
come back to reality
that 's their reality
i would not be standing here if i knew any other way
i need an architect who 's as good as i was
i UNknown e got somebody better
pleased to meet you
mr cobb has a job offer he 'd iike to discuss with you
a work UNknown ?
you 'r e not gonna teii me anything first ?
before i describe the job
i have to know you can do it
that 's more iike it
UNknown as ?
you consciously create each aspect
but sometimes it feels iike it 's almost creating itself if you know what i mean
genuine inspiration right ?
we create and perceive our world simultaneously
and our mind does this so weii that we don 't even know it 's happening
that UNknown us to get right in the middle of that process
now this is where i need you
you create the world of the dream
we bring the subject into that dream and they fiii it with their subconscious
how could i ever acquire enough UNknown to make them think that it 's reality ?
weil dreams they feei reai while we 'r e in them right ?
it 's only when we wake up that we realize something was actuaily strange
let me ask you a question
you never reaily remember the beginning of a dream do you ?
you always wind up right in the middle of what 's going on
i guess yeah
weil we just came from the uh
think about it
where are you right now ?
we 'r e dreaming ?
you 'r e in the middle of the workshop sleeping
this is your first iesson in shared dreaming
and a face fuii of glass hurts iike heil
when you 'r e in it it feels real
it was a training program for soldiers to shoot stab and strangle each other and then wake up
why don 't you give us another five minutes ?
five minutes ?
in a dream your mind functions more quickly therefore time seems to feei more slow
five minutes in the reai world gives you an hour in the dream
why don 't you see what you can get up to in five minutes ?
UNknown of my subconscious
you build this world
that 's one of the ways we extract information from the subject
how else do you do it ?
by creating something secure
the mind UNknown UNknown it with information it 's trying to protect
you understand ?
my question is what happens when you start messing with the physics of it ail ?
UNknown then metal groanlng
yes it is
because my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world
the more you change things the quicker the UNknown start to UNknown on you
what they 'r e gonna attack us ?
jeez mind teiling your subconscious to take it easy ?
it 's my subconscious
never re create places from your memory
always imagine new places
only use details
never entire areas
is that what happened to you ?
listen to me
that why you need me to build your dreams ?
hey get off of her
let me go !
there was stiii time on the clock
you can 't wake up from within the dream unless you die
UNknown 'i i need a UNknown
that 's some subconscious you UNknown e got on you
UNknown 's his wife ?
UNknown you can have on you that no one else knows
like this is a UNknown die
that would defeat the purpose
dee only i know the balance and the weight of this particular UNknown die
that way when you iook at your UNknown you know beyond a doubt that you 'r e not in someone else 's dream
i UNknown e never seen anyone pick it up that quickly before
reality 's not gonna be enough for her now and when she comes back
when she comes back you 'r e gonna have her building UNknown
where are you gonna be ?
i gotta go visit UNknown
it 's UNknown 's back yard
it 's a necessary risk
weil there 's plenty of good thieves
we don 't just need a thief
we need a UNknown
you never know
you 'r e buying
it 's UNknown
it 's just bloody difficult
he is good at what he does right ?
oh he 's the best but he has no imagination
not iike you
let me ask you something
have you done it before ?
we tried it
you didn 't plant it deep enough ?
no it 's not just about depth
you need the simplest version of the idea in order for it to grow naturaily in your subject 's mind
it 's a subtle art
do what is this idea that you need to plant ?
we need the heir of a major corporation to dissolve his father 's empire
right there you have various UNknown UNknown and UNknown UNknown sentiments and so forth
but aii of that stuff it 's um
it 's reaily at the mercy of your subject 's prejudice you see ?
what you have to do is start at the absolute basic
which is what ?
do you have a chemist ?
no not yet
why don 't you take me there ?
once you UNknown e iost your tail
the man at the bar
don 't remember
back here ?
not dreaming now are you ?
UNknown then people UNknown
i 'm here to protect my investment
i tried not to come but
but there 's nothing quite iike it
it 's just pure creation
UNknown we take a iook at some UNknown architecture ?
in a dream you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes
that UNknown you create closed UNknown
iike the penrose UNknown
but how big do these UNknown have to be ?
it could be anything from the floor of a building to an entire city
they have to be complicated enough that we can hide from the UNknown
a maze ?
then the ionger we have before the UNknown catch us ?
no one iikes to feei someone else messing around in their mind
cobb can 't build anymore can he ?
i don 't know if he can 't but he won 't
he thinks it 's safer if he doesn 't know the UNknown
but i think it 's mal
his ex wife ?
what was she iike in reai iife ?
UNknown was iovely
and to go into the field with us
which are ?
two UNknown ?
it is possible
a UNknown sedative
there 's no room for tourists on a job iike this
i use it every day
perhaps you wiii not want to see
you see ?
in dream time ?
why do they do it ?
do you stiii dream
the dream has become their reality
who are you to say otherwise sir ?
let 's see what you can do
you know what you have to do
UNknown no ?
that 's not your concern
mr UNknown this isn 't your UNknown corporate espionage
you asked me for UNknown
i do hope you understand the gravity of that request
now the seed that we plant in this man 's mind wiii grow into an idea
this idea wiii define him
it may come to change
weil it may come to change everything about him
we 'r e the iast company standing between them and UNknown energy UNknown
and we can no ionger compete
UNknown they 'i i controi the energy supply of half the world
in effect they become a new UNknown
the world needs robert fischer to change his mind
how is robert fischer 's relationship with his father ?
rumor is the relationship is quite complicated
weil we can 't work based UNknown on rumor can we ?
can you get me access to this man here ?
fischer junior 's godfather
references are something of a specialty for me
take them down
weil shaii we voice your concerns with maurice directly ?
not sure that 's necessary
no no no
do do it
i put it beside his bed
he hasn 't even noticed
robert we need to talk about a power of attorney
i know this is hard but it 's imperative not now
do now in the first UNknown of the dream
i can UNknown browning
do he gives himself the idea
it has to seem self UNknown
arthur thank you
i didn 't realize anyone was here so
do you 'r e UNknown huh ?
an elegant solution for keeping track of reality
was it your idea ?
no it was uh
just spin and spin
how are the UNknown coming along ?
each UNknown UNknown to the part of the subject 's subconscious that we are trying to access
do i 'm making the bottom UNknown a hospital so fischer wiii bring his father
no no no
only the dreamer should know the UNknown
why is that so important ?
in case one of us brings in our UNknown
we don 't want them knowing the details of the maze
you mean in case you bring mai in
you can 't keep her out can you ?
weil she 'd sabotage the whole operation
cobb do the others know ?
no one said it 's getting worse
i need to get home
that 's aii i care about right now
why can 't you go home ?
because they think i kiiled her
i wiii split up my father 's empire
now this is obviously an idea that robert himself would choose to reject which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious
the subconscious is UNknown by emotion right ?
how do you translate business strategy into emotion ?
that 's what we 'r e here to figure out
robert 's relationship with his father
is UNknown to say the ieast
can we run with that ?
we suggest breaking up his father 's company as a screw you to the old man
no because i think positive emotion UNknown negative emotion every time
we aii yearn for reconciliation for UNknown
we need robert fischer to have a positive UNknown reaction to aii this
aii right weil try this
that might work
thank you for your contribution
when we get inside his mind we 'r e gonna have to work with what we find
i wiii not foilow in my father 's footsteps
then the next UNknown down we feed him
i wiii create something for myself
then by the time we hit the bottom UNknown we bring out the big guns
my father doesn 't want me to be him
brain function in the dream wiii be about 20 times normal
and when you enter a dream within that dream the effect is UNknown
it 's three dreams that 's 10 hours times 20
math was never my strong subject
how much time is that ?
it 's a week the first UNknown down
dix months the second UNknown down and the third UNknown
that 's 10 years
depends on the dream
i 'm hoping you have something more elegant than shooting me in the head
it 's that feeling of failing you get that UNknown you awake
UNknown you out of the dream
we gonna feei a kick with this UNknown ?
i UNknown the sedative to ieave inner ear function UNknown
that way however deep the sleep the sleeper stiii feels failing
we could use a UNknown UNknown to synchronize the different kicks
and we need
UNknown to los angeles
he makes it every two weeks
he must be flying private then
why 's that ?
you 'd have to buy out the entire cabin and the first class flight attendant
i bought the airline
you know what you have to do
you remember when you asked me to marry you ?
of course i do
that we 'd grow old together
and we can
just wanted to see what kind of tests you 'r e doing on your own every night
this has nothing to do with you
this has everything to do with me
you UNknown e asked me to share dreams with you
it 's the only way i can stiii dream
why is it so important to dream ?
in my dreams we 'r e stiii together
these aren 't just dreams
these are memories
i know i did
you can 't iet her go
you don 't understand
they 'r e memories that i have to change
weil what 's down there that you regret ?
listen there 's only one thing you need to understand about me
mine and mal 's yes
where is she ?
i realize i 'm gonna regret this moment that i need to see their faces one iast time
and whatever i do
as i 'm about to caii out to them they run away
if i 'm ever gonna see their faces again
i UNknown e gotta get back home
the reai world
what are you doing here ?
my name is
what are you doing here ?
i 'm just trying to understand
how could you understand ?
do you know what it is to be a iover ?
to be half of a whole ?
you 'r e waiting for a train
a train that wiii take you far away
you know where you hope this train wiii take you but you don 't know for sure
but it doesn 't matter
how can it not matter to you where that train wiii take you ?
this is a hotei suite where we used to spend our anniversary
what happened here ?
you said we 'd be together !
you said we 'd grow old together !
i 'i i come back for you
do you reaily think that that 's gonna contain her ?
when 's the funeral ?
we should move
i promised miles
and it doesn 't have to be me but then you have to show arthur what i just saw
get us another seat on the plane
i go to UNknown for the rest of my iife
complete the job en route i make one phone caii from the plane you have no trouble getting through immigration
i 'm sorry
you must have dropped it
yes he um
i 'm sorry for your ioss
here you go
ha ha bloody ha
UNknown off radlo
it 's not
the UNknown 's worth more than that
you might at ieast drop me at my stop
i 'm afraid that it doesn 't
gunflre then UNknown UNknown
get him in the back room
is he dying ?
blocked by a freight train
why put a train in a downtown intersection ?
i didn 't
why the heii were we ambushed ?
those were not UNknown UNknown
they 'd been trained for god 's sakes
how could he be trained ?
fischer 's had an UNknown teach his subconscious to defend itself so his subconscious is UNknown
it should UNknown e shown in the research
this was your job goddamn it !
this was your responsibility !
you were meant to check fischer 's background !
we are not prepared for this !
we have dealt with sub security before !
we 'i i be more carefui and we 'r e gonna be fine !
this was not a part of the plan !
he 's dying
no don 't do that !
don 't do that
what do you mean it won 't wake him up ?
when we die in a dream we wake up
not from this
we drop into UNknown
just raw infinite subconscious
which in our case is just you
how iong could we be stuck ?
trying to escape untii the UNknown how iong ?
and if we get kiiled we 'i i be iost in UNknown tiii our brains turn to scrambled egg hmm ?
you knew these risks and didn 't teii us ?
there weren 't meant to be risks
i didn 't know we 'd be dealing with gunfire
you had no right
you knew about this and went along with it ?
i trusted him
what with mal ?
that has nothing to do with it
i did what i had to to get to my children
you ied us into a war zone with no way out ?
there is a way out
we continue on with the job and we do it as fast as possible and we get out using the kick just iike before
i am sitting this one out on this UNknown
ten hours of flight time is a week at this UNknown
that means each and every one of us wiii be kiiled
that i can guarantee you
we have no other choice but to continue on and do it as fast as possible
UNknown is the only way forwards
i 'm insured against kidnapping for up to 10 miilion
this should be very simple
we need the combination
teii us what it is
i don 't know
an hour ?
and UNknown wasn 't supposed to be shot in the chest
you UNknown e got one hour now get us something useful please
why does browning say you do ?
i don 't know
you have one hour
they have someone with access to your father 's office
they 'r e trying to open his safe
yeah weil neither do i so
no he never gave me any combination
maybe he did
weil what then ?
we didn 't have very many uh UNknown experiences together
perhaps after your mother died
after my mother died you know what he told me ?
robert there 's reaily nothing to be said
oh weil he was bad with emotion
i was 1 1
he 's in a iot of pain
when we get down to the iower UNknown the pain wiii be iess intense
and if he dies ?
worst case scenario ?
UNknown is gonna become your reality
you 'r e gonna be iost down there so iong that you 'r e gonna become an old man
UNknown with regret ?
and we 'i i be young men together again
they just wanna ransom us
i heard them
UNknown for you
that 's an alternate
it splits up the UNknown businesses of fischer morrow
it 'd be the end of the entire empire as we know it
destroying my whole inheritance ?
why would he suggest such a thing ?
i just don 't know
he loved you
he could barely speak
he puiled me close
you might have the rest of the team convinced to carry on with this job
but they don 't know the truth
the truth that mai is bursting through your subconscious
and the truth that as we go deeper into fischer we 'r e also going deeper into you
and i 'm not sure we 'r e gonna iike what we find
we were working together
i kept pushing things
i wanted to go further
UNknown iike 50 years
it wasn 't so bad at first feeling iike gods
and what about for her ?
weil to wake up from that after years after decades
that she needed to wake up to come back to reality that in order to get back home we had to kiii ourselves
if this is my dream why can 't i controi this ?
you don 't know you 'r e dreaming !
UNknown wanted to do it but she could not do it alone
aii right ?
if you jump you 'r e not gonna wake up remember ?
you 'r e gonna die
now just step back inside
we UNknown e talked enough
or i 'i i jump right now
aii right ?
take a second think about our children
think about james
what does that mean ?
i filed a ietter with our attorney explaining how i 'm UNknown for my safety
how you UNknown e threatened to kiii me
why did you do this ?
i love you
i UNknown e freed you from the guilt of choosing to ieave them
we 'r e going home to our reai children
oh no no no
you 'r e waiting for a train
mal goddamn it don 't do this !
a train that wiii take you far away
james and UNknown are waiting for you !
you know where you hope this train wiii take you but you can 't know for sure
mal goddamn it !
it made it impossible for me to try to explain the nature of her madness
your guilt UNknown her
but you are not responsible for the idea that destroyed her
and if we are gonna succeed in this you have to forgive yourself and you 'r e gonna have to confront her
but you don 't have to do that alone
no you 'r e not
i 'm doing it for the others
because they have no idea the risk they UNknown e taken coming down here with you
we have to move
not consciously anyway
i got somebody in your father 's office right now ready to tap in the combination
give me the first six numbers that come to your head right now
i have no idea
right now !
you 'i i have to do better than that
you hear me ?
relationship with his father is worse than we imagined
this helps us how ?
the stronger the issues the more UNknown the UNknown
how are we gonna reconcile them ?
i 'm working on that
we gotta break out of here before we 'r e UNknown boxed in
we need to shift his UNknown from his father to his godfather
destroy his one positive relationship ?
no repair his relationship with his father whilst exposing his godfather 's true nature
we should charge fischer a iot more than UNknown for this job
his security is gonna get worse as we go deeper
i think we run with mr charles
we run with mr charles iike on the UNknown job
you UNknown e done it before ?
the subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces
i need some kind of distraction
listen to me
everything down there is gonna be unstable as heil
don 't jump too soon
we only got one shot at that kick
we gotta make it
the rest is on you
you ready ?
i was teiling you my story
i guess it wasn 't to your UNknown
there goes mr charles
rod green from UNknown
must UNknown e blown you off
that is unless her phone number reaily is only six UNknown
funny way to make friends someone stealing your UNknown iike that
about 500 right ?
my people are already on it as we speak
who or what is mr charles ?
it 's a UNknown designed to turn fischer against his own subconscious
it involves teiling the mark that he 's dreaming which involves attracting a iot of attention to us
didn 't cobb say never to do that ?
mr UNknown can i have a moment ?
i 'm sorry but
no it 's much closer
that 's yusuf 's driving
my name is mr charles
you remember me don 't you ?
i 'm the head of your security down here
get out on a different floor keep moving
dump the UNknown
are you talking about um UNknown ?
i am here to protect you
you 'r e not safe here
they 'r e coming for you
you feei that ?
they 'r e stiii iooking at us
yeah it was worth a shot
we should probably get out of here
none of this is real
you 'r e in a dream
now the easiest way for you to test yourself is to try and remember how you arrived at this hotel
can you do that ?
i was sent here to protect you in the event that UNknown tried to puii you into a dream
and i believe that 's what 's going on right now
these men were sent here to UNknown you aii right ?
if you want my help you have to remain calm
i need you to work with me
i should just kiii myself to wake up right ?
i wouldn 't do that if i were you
you may go into a further dream state
now you know what i 'm talking about
you remember the training
give me the gun
there was um a iot of gunfire
there was rain
where were they holding you ?
they had us in the back of a van
that explains the gravity shifts
you 'r e in the back of a van
UNknown to do with a safe
god why is it so hard to remember ?
it 's iike trying to remember a dream after you UNknown e woken up
listen it takes years of practice
you and browning have been puiled into this dream because they 'r e trying to steai something from your mind
i need you to focus and try and remember what that is
what is it
they 'r e trying to extract a number from your subconscious
it can represent anything
we should try hotei rooms
what was the number
this is very important
that 's good
while you 'r e aii asleep in 528
i wait for yusuf 's kick
weil how wiii you know ?
his music warns me
do we get a nice UNknown kick
if it 's too soon we won 't get puiled out
but if it 's too iate
i won 't be able to drop us
weil why not ?
can 't drop you without gravity
mr fischer ?
i 'm already under
i 'm sorry ?
let 's foilow him and see how he behaves
weil not exactly
the kidnappers are working for you ?
to get the alternate wiil ?
fischer morrow has been my entire iife
i can 't iet you destroy it
i 'm not gonna throw away my inheritance
i couldn 't iet you rise to your father 's iast taunt
what taunt ?
a UNknown for you to build something for yourself by teiling you you 'r e not worthy of his accomplishments
what but that he was um disappointed ?
i 'm sorry
mr fischer ?
trust me it 's what i do
he 's hiding something and we need to find out what that is
i need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you
we 'i i enter his subconscious and find out what he doesn 't want you to know
we 'r e going into fischer 's
i told him it was browning 's so he 'd be a part of our team
he 's gonna help us break into his own subconscious
and i wiii iead them on a merry chase
just be back before the kick
go to sleep
UNknown the truth we want fischer to iearn
i mean what 's down there for you ?
i need you to draw the security away from the complex understand ?
who guides fischer in ?
i designed the place
fischer you 'i i be going with him
the windows on that upper floor are big enough for me to cover you from that tower
in order to find out the truth about your father you 'r e gonna need to break into browning 's mind on your own
i first noticed it about 20 minutes ago
i thought it was the wind up here
we move fast
which gives arthur three minutes
they have to climb to the terrace
then they need a new route a more direct route
there must be access routes that cut through the maze
i don 't think i should teii you
we don 't have time for this
did he add anything ?
he added an air UNknown system that can cut through the maze
yeah we missed it
what next kick ?
arthur has a couple minutes and we have about 20
iike they know something
come on !
does the strong room have windows ?
it wouldn 't be very strong if it did
let 's hope fischer iikes what he finds in there
are those UNknown his subconscious ?
there 's an entire army headed your way
fischer it 's a trap
how do you know that ?
UNknown is just a projection
there 's no use in UNknown him
his mind 's already trapped down there
it 's aii over
we failed ?
i swear we had this
let 's set the charges
no there 's stiii another way
we have to foilow fischer down there
not enough time
and we wiii find him
okay as soon as arthur 's music kicks in just use the UNknown to revive him
we can give him his own kick down below
look you get him in there
as soon as the music ends you blow up the hospital and we aii ride the kick back up the UNknown
it 's worth a shot if UNknown can hold the guards off while i set the charges
UNknown wiii never make it wiii he ?
cobb come on
go for it
i am gone with or without you
UNknown 's right
mal 's gonna be down there
i know where to find her
UNknown 'i i have fischer
how do you know ?
because she wants me to come after him
UNknown wants me back down there with her
aii right ?
no room for tourists on these jobs
don 't be siily
this is incredible
then we moved to that building right there
after mai became pregnant that became our home
you UNknown aii of this from memory ?
like i told you we had iots of time
weil wiii she be in there ?
in the reai world we 'd have to choose but not here
we 'r e gonna have to come up with some kind of a kick
it can grow to define or destroy you
your world is not real
dimple iittle thought that changes everything
do certain of your world
of what 's real
or do you think he 's as iost as i was ?
i have to get back to our children because you ieft them
because you ieft us
yes but i 'm gonna see them up above
you keep teiling yourself that but you don 't believe it
what if i 'm what 's real ?
you keep teiling yourself what you know
but what do you believe ?
what do you feel ?
what truth ?
you planted the idea in my mind ?
what is she talking about ?
the reason i knew UNknown was possible was because i did it to her first
i did it to my own wife
you 'r e waiting for a train
you know where you hope this train wiii take you but you can 't know for sure
yet it doesn 't matter
now teii me why !
because you 'i i be together !
that death was the only escape
mal no !
you betrayed me
you can stiii keep your promise
we can stiii be together right here in the world we built together
you can 't have him
if i stay here wiii you iet him go ?
what are you talking about ?
fischer is on the porch
go check he 's alive
go check he 's alive right now
you can 't stay here to be with her
i 'm not
that means he 's down here somewhere
that means i have to find him
i can 't stay with her anymore because she doesn 't exist
i 'm the only thing you do believe in anymore
you aii right ?
you 'r e just a shade of my reai wife
and you were the best that i could do but i 'm sorry you 'r e just not good enough
does this feei real ?
don 't iose yourself !
find UNknown and bring him back !
i wiil !
but we did
and i have to iet you go
i have to iet you go
i 'm sorry
that 's what i 'm gonna do
no he 'i i be aii right

so if you wouldn 't mind getting to the point

and within a year a child
one month more the child was back in the same hospital sick with fever
and within days after that the child suddenly was dead
yes a child was dead and yes a child was buried
but the UNknown baby was still alive
and became the property of another man
a master spy who had devised the greatest plan a russian patriot could ever invent
a plan to destroy america
it had all started with an american named lee harvey UNknown
in UNknown he UNknown to russia
three years later he returned home
but the man who came back to america was in fact a russian spy named alec
on november 22 UNknown
the spy master was now given the go ahead to create many more like alec
scores of agents
at an abandoned monastery UNknown and other boys and girls learned english long before they learned russian
drilled in UNknown UNknown
the spy master made warriors of iron
UNknown and UNknown
when does the good fairy come in ?
UNknown was matched with a child of a visiting american family
there was an accident the family died
UNknown was sent to america to live a complete lie and to patiently await the day to attack from within day x
the long awaited mission is here
UNknown will travel to your city to kill the president of russia at the funeral of the american vice president
UNknown is UNknown
highly trained russian sleeper agents UNknown into american society to sabotage and assassinate supposedly they d wait years to strike

what are you doing ?
she 's not here and no sign of the husband either
did it ever occur to you that maybe that russian was lying ?
i don 't know cause you were gonna lock her up
why 'd she run ?
see it from her perspective
maybe her husband is in some real danger
maybe god forbid salt is who she says she is
maybe is your department
we bring her in or we bring her down
do you have any idea who this woman is ?
what she 's done for this country

even as the body of slain president UNknown is on it 's way back to moscow UNknown american riots have UNknown across russia
with bombings of u s diplomats in moscow
the russian armed forces have been put on high alert
responding to a rapid UNknown crisis
president lewis has called for an emergency white house meeting
greetings comrade UNknown
you were not supposed to get married

i did it to seem normal
when you escaped today i felt not even i could have hoped for so much
you are my greatest creation
you trained me well
but now you trust me
next part 2
i left russia one year after you to prague
i have been a UNknown liaison to the white house for three years
colonel edward UNknown
more importantly our mission
that 's where the president needs to be
how do we do it ?
don 't worry he will be there
that 's my job to make sure he 's there
and what 's my job ?
do you remember UNknown when we were young ? and you had to finish first in everything
you had to be the best at everything
even though you knew you would be beaten with a cane you had to finish first
tonight you will kill america 's president
id 's please
confirm this a colonel UNknown and a major egypt
step though please sir
others have been here longer
what others ?
and i was the least
there must be others here to finish what we begin
UNknown nice to see you again
ted your russian cla agent salt what can you tell us about her ?
we think she may be a soviet plant
UNknown years ago in preparation for something the UNknown called day x
a day that would mark the start of a large scale strike against the u s and her allies
that should be the president now
you have a big job UNknown but you can do it
you still haven 't told me what your job is
geronimo it 's UNknown
saw who ?
the other new officer
maybe dressed as a UNknown officer
this is jenkins
if this was authorized by the russian government it is an act of war and we will respond
let 's go sir
my own men couldn 't get through that door once it 's closed
mr president director medford is up
mary anne what is the situation ?
it should be coming up on one of your screens
what you see there represents temperature drops in mobile missile units in siberia
it means that the russians are UNknown their missiles to the field
and that 's been confirmed on the ground mr president
mr president i strongly recommend we go from UNknown 4 to UNknown 2
at least on a forward basis
it 's not on a table it 's not a UNknown
we just lost the feed from most of our security camera 's
we are blind down here and no one can enter this facility
command our eyes are down both ways and we have a UNknown security door UNknown
get out there now
this is president howard lewis proceed with UNknown
yes mr president
UNknown tango echo
whiskey five six tango
god be with you
is the camera outside this door working ?
officer come in
that 's her
screw protocol james we got an enemy agent out there
protocol is protocol sir
unless you do exactly as i say i will be the last person you will ever see
let 's have a look at some attack options
go to hell
but you weren 't with us in russia i would UNknown e remembered
i didn 't think i UNknown l be able to do it
to resist the temptation to say something
and you met mike and well things changed
this is astonishing
at least i was right
i had a feeling we 'd lost you back there in north korea
i could see how moved you were with mike 's little white knight routine
you were supposed to recruit the man not fall in love with him
that 's why i told UNknown to pick him up
by the way how is mike ?
UNknown is dead
saves me the trouble
you see ?
you needed somebody to take the blame
i 'm the bad guy
and i 'm the hero
i said now !
show me your hands !
what is your name sir ?
i 'm theodore winter cla
help the president
i want her alone in a room
if there are other ka 's out there i want her to talk
she 's trained not to talk no matter what we do to her
if we 'r e gonna find these people must find them ourselves
somebody already did
12 dead including UNknown
then she 's the fbl 's
because somebody had to
you knew something was wrong the moment UNknown walked in
so did i
i would like you to believe that yeah
it 's a big accusation
i guess you UNknown l just have to decide for yourself
how many more like you are there ?
like me ?
do you really think a trained soviet agent couldn t kill the russian president at point blank range if she wanted to ?
or you for that matter
i could UNknown e killed you at the funeral and i didn 't
you surrendered to me because i gave you no choice
you know better
well maybe you can think of a way around that
they took everything from me
i UNknown l kill them
did you know there are more people with genius iq s living in china than there are people of any kind living in the united states ?
that can 't possibly be true
it is true
well first of all a lot of people live in china
but here 's my question
i didn 't know they take sat s in china
they dont i wasn 't talking about china anymore i was talking about here
you got 1600 ?
but i cant sing
or you row crew or you invent a 25 dollar UNknown
or you get into a final club
or you get into a final club exactly
you know from a UNknown perspective sometimes not being in an UNknown group can be a good thing
this is serious
i like guys who row crew
well i cant do that
have you ever tried ?
i 'm trying now
to row crew ?
but you UNknown e seen guys who row crew right ?
they 'r e world class athletes
and a second ago you said you like guys who row crew crew so i assumed you 'd met one
i guess i meant i liked the idea of it
the way a girl likes cowboys
no it 's just that since the beginning of the conversation about finals clubs i think i may have missed a birthday
there are more people in china with genius
iq 's than the entire population of
the phoenix is the most UNknown
the fly club roosevelt punched the UNknown
which one ?
i actually meant which roosevelt
you can see why its so important to get in
okay well which is the easiest one to get into ?
why would you ask me that ?
i was just asking
our UNknown eduardo made 300 000 betting on UNknown last UNknown and
eduardo wont come close to UNknown the ability to UNknown doesn 't impress anybody around here
must be nice
he likes UNknown
i think you asked me that because you think the final club that 's easiest to get into is the one where i UNknown l have the best chance
the one that 's easiest to get into would be the one where anybody had the best chance
you didnt ask which one was the best one you asked me which one was the easiest
i was honestly just asking
mark i 'm not speaking in code
you have finals clubs UNknown and you need to see someone about this who UNknown l prescribe some sort of medication
you don 't care if side effects may include blindness
yes there is
i didn 't mean to be UNknown
all i 'm saying i need to do something substantial in order to get the UNknown the clubs
you think teddy roosevelt got elected president because he was a member of the phoenix club ?
he was a member of the UNknown and yes he did
well why dont you concentrate on being the best you you can be
did you really just say that
i was kidding
i want to be straight forward and tell you that i think you should be a lot more UNknown
is this a joke ?
no it 's not
you 'r e going to introduce me to people i wouldn 't normally get to meet ?
what the fuck is that supposed to mean ?
erica the reason we 'r e able to sit here and drink is that you used to sleep with the door guy
the door guy 's name is bobby
i haven 't slept with the door guy the door guy 's a friend of mine
he 's a perfectly good class of people and what part of long _ island are you from UNknown ?
i 'm going back to my dorm
wait is this true
i have to go
i appreciate that but i have to study
you don 't have to study
let 's just talk
you don 't have to study
why do you keep saying i dont have to study
because you go to b u !
do you want to get some food ?
i 'm sorry you 'r e not sufficiently impressed with my education
and i 'm sorry i don 't have a rowboat
so were even
i don 't want to be friends
i was being polite i had no intention UNknown friends with you
im under some pressure right now from my UNknown class
if we could just order some food
i think we should
but you 'r e going to go through life thinking that girls don 't like you because you 'r e a UNknown
and i want you to know from the bottom of my heart that that won 't be true
it UNknown l be because you 'r e an asshole
erica UNknown a bitch
for the record she may look like a UNknown but she 's getting all kinds of help from our friends at victoria 's secret
she 's a UNknown as in barely anything there false advertising
the truth is she has a nice face
i need to think of something to help me take my mind off her
easy enough except i need an idea
i 'm a little intoxicated i 'm not gonna lie
so what if it 's not even UNknown and it 's a tuesday night ?
the UNknown UNknown is open on my UNknown and some of these people have pretty UNknown facebook UNknown
billy UNknown 's sitting here and had the idea of putting some of the pictures next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on who 's hotter
good call mr UNknown
unfortunately harvard doesn 't keep a public UNknown facebook so i 'm going to have to get all the images from the individual houses that people are in
let the UNknown begin
i can run an empty search and it returns all of the images in the UNknown in a single page
then i can save the page and UNknown will save all the images for me
all i have to is UNknown the same script i used on lowell and its done
quincy has no online facebook what a sham
there is nothing i can do about that
UNknown is intense
you have to do searches and if your search returns more then 20 matches nothing gets returned
once you do get results they dont link directly to the images they link to a UNknown that UNknown or something weird
this maybe UNknown i il come back later
UNknown is a little better
its a UNknown search but you can do an empty search and gets links to pages with a UNknown picture
its slightly obnoxious that they let you view one picture at a time
and theres no way i am gonna go to 500 hundred pages to UNknown UNknown 1 at a time
so its definitely necessary to break out the UNknown and UNknown that UNknown script
how did you know that ?
it 's on your UNknown
no i need the UNknown you used for the oil UNknown
are you okay ?
you mean other students
i need the UNknown ?
i need the UNknown ?
give UNknown UNknown a base rating of 1400
at any time girl a has a rating r a and girl b has e rating r b
when any two girls are matched up there 's an expectation of which will win based on their current rating
let 's write it
on the right
just a couple of people
the question is who are they gonna send it to ?
hey guys check this out
the one on the left
you dont want to read this
erica is this yours
get the hell out of here
thats an awful lot of traffic
you think maybe we should shut it down before we get into trouble
well there is an unusual amount of traffic which UNknown
your saying its UNknown for 4 in the morning
no this would be UNknown for half time at the UNknown
you dont think
its not a coincidence
thats not what happened
no i was back at the bar with erica UNknown
she said all that
i was reading from the transcript of her deposition
why UNknown you even need to UNknown her
thats really for us to decide
you think if i know she could make me look like a jerk i UNknown l be more likely to
its been almost 3 hours and frankly you did spend an awful lot of time UNknown mr UNknown with the girls testimony from the bar
i am not UNknown she just made alot of that up
she was under oath
they got UNknown hits within 2 hours
is there anyway to make this a fair fight
jump out and swim
we are UNknown identical we would stay in one place just row the damn boat
you hear about this ?
at four am
what were we doing that none of us heard about this
i do not know 3 hour technical row before breakfast full course load studying
another 3 hours in the tank then studying
im not sure how we missed it
how much activity was on this thing
twenty two thousand page requests
twenty two thousand
he developed the site in 1 night and he did it while he was drunk
twenty two thousand
he was UNknown while doing this
know what it think
taylor UNknown taylor UNknown the UNknown way
my last UNknown the same as my brother
mr UNknown this is an administrative board hearing
your being accused of intentionally UNknown security violating copyright violating individual privacy
by creating the UNknown www UNknown com
you also charged with being in violation of UNknown policy on distribution of UNknown images
before we begin with our questioning your allowed to make a statement would you like to do so ?
to harvard UNknown women 's association and to any women at harvard who might have been insulted as i take that they were
as for any charges UNknown from the breach of security
i believe i deserve some recognition from this board
UNknown me may i
i can assure you of its UNknown
in fact it was that level of UNknown that led us to you in less then 4 hours
four hours ?
so six months academic probation
wow they had to make an example out of you
they have my UNknown
i was kidding for gods sake doesnt anybody have a sense of humor
i tried to stop you
why do i love china
ok lets look at a sample problem
suppose were given a computer a 16 bit UNknown address and a page size of 256 UNknown
the system uses a one level page table that starts at address UNknown
maybe you want dna on your 16 bit system who knows
the first few pages are reserved for the hardware flag etc assume page table UNknown have 8 status UNknown
eight bit status code will then be
ah i see we have our first surrender
dont worry mr UNknown brighter men then you have tried and failed this class
one valid bit one UNknown bit one reference bit 5 permission bit
that is correct
what can i do for you ?
did i insult your girlfriends ?
no you did 'n t
i dont know
got a minute
we have to why ?
we row crew
we checked you out you also built UNknown
what is UNknown
kind of a no UNknown you in high school to right ?
asked for an UNknown player that UNknown your taste in music
any body try to buy it ?
for free ?
we think its great it is called the harvard network
you can create your own page interests UNknown UNknown
then people can go online and see your UNknown
based on the idea that girls
girls want to only go out with guys who go to harvard
me and my brother dont have trouble getting
basically what were talking about is UNknown UNknown any of those other social UNknown sites
we need a UNknown who is creative
and we know who can take the initiative
this could help UNknown your image
wow you would do that for me
we 'd like to work with you
our first program graduated and went to work for UNknown
our second UNknown is overwhelmed with school work
we would need you to build the site write UNknown code we will provide
it was three or four years ago i dont know what i said
when did you come to eduardo ?
i dont understand that question
you UNknown answering in the affirmative
it was called UNknown then
this doesnt need to be that UNknown
im currently in the middle of two different UNknown
did you answer UNknown ?
when taylor and cameron UNknown did in november ask you to build harvard connection
did you say yes ?
i said i 'd help
when did you approach mr savarin with the idea for the facebook
i wouldnt say i approached him
at a party at alpha UNknown pl
but UNknown girls are generally attracted to guys like me
i dont know if an UNknown could find the connection to you
its not that complicated there hot there smart they are not jewish they cant dance
hey mark is here !
i have to tell you something your not going to believe
are you kidding ?
send the invitation on monday
my first UNknown party UNknown
you got pinched by the phoenix
what did you want to talk to me about
mark you said you come up with something
yeah ive think i come up with something come outside
20 degrees outside
people came to UNknown right ?
it UNknown because hey saw pictures of hot girls
you can go anywhere on the internet and see pictures of hot girls
because they saw pictures of girls that they knew
im talking about taking the entire social experience of college
and putting it online
it would be exclusive
i told him i thought it sounded great was a great idea
there was nothing to hack people were gonna provide their own pictures their own information
and people would have the ability to invite or not invite their UNknown to join
in a world were social UNknown was everything
that was the thing
so i was wondering why he was coming to me and not his UNknown
UNknown UNknown chris hughes they were UNknown
were gonna need a little start up cash to rent a server to get it online
so that was why
70 for me 30 for you for putting up the 1000 dollars and for handling everything on the business end
ok did he add anything else ?
gretchen excuse me for UNknown UNknown discovery is this
UNknown if you let me continue with my line of questioning
but at the moment i could buy mount UNknown street take the UNknown club and turn it into my UNknown pong room
i UNknown l let you know how the party ends
we recognise UNknown a plaintiff in one suit involving facebook
and a witness in another
did he mention tyler UNknown cameron UNknown UNknown UNknown or harvard UNknown
but that he looked at what they had and decided it UNknown worth his time
he said even his most pathetic UNknown knew about getting people interested in the UNknown then these guys
these guys means my clients
mark didnt want to UNknown anything with UNknown
hacked into the harvard computers he blew his nose at the add board
he got alot of UNknown UNknown did exactly what he wanted to do
were you aware that while mr UNknown was UNknown the UNknown he was also UNknown UNknown the UNknown
not at the time i UNknown
it really did not have much to do with the UNknown dating site
how would you know you were 'n t even there
were you aware that while mr UNknown was building the UNknown
he was leading the UNknown to believe he was building the harvard connection
conclusion not found in evidence
we are about to find this new evidence
from mark UNknown to tyler UNknown november 30 UNknown i read over all the stuff you sent me re
i just got about 3 of your missed calls i was working on a problem then my system collapsed
from mark UNknown to tyler and cameron UNknown december 10 UNknown this week has been pretty busy between harvard classes and work
so i think its probably best to postpone the meeting
im also really busy UNknown
ok anybody else feel like there is somethin up with this guy
tell him ok
i know i know
its gonna cost a little more money
how much more
i UNknown l get out of here
from mark UNknown to tyler and cameron UNknown and UNknown UNknown

thats correct he had 42 days to study our system and get out ahead
do you see any of your code on facebook
did i use any of your code ?
you stole our whole UNknown idea !
can i continue with my deposition ?
you know you really dont need a UNknown team to get to the bottom of this
if you guys were the UNknown of facebook you invented facebook
i cant wait to stand over your shoulder and watch you write us a check
have you UNknown seen her with anyone ?
and if not do you happen to know if shes going to go ?
UNknown people do not walk around with a sign on them that says im

this guy doesnt have 3 UNknown to rub together to make a fourth
allright yes UNknown what well do mr hotchkiss well put it all together and well e mail it to you

id like to
we dont know that hes not a good guy
we know he stole our idea
we know lied to our faces for a month and a half
no he never lied to our face
ok he never saw our faces fine he lied through our e mail accounts
and he gave himself a 42 day head start
because he knows and apparently you dont
which is that getting there first is everything
im a UNknown UNknown dave i dont think you need to school me on the importance of getting there first
he is our counsel
whats that gonna do
no i want to hire the UNknown to beat the shit out of him with a hammer
we dont have to do that
i m 6 5 220 and theres 2 of us
well whatever im saying lets calm down until we know what were talking about
how much more information are you waiting for
we met with mark 3 times we exchanged 52 e mails we can prove that he looked at the code
what is that on the bottom of the page
mark UNknown production
on every page
exactly what we said to him
hes giving us the finger in the crimson
while we are waiting for dads lawyer to look this stuff over we can get something going in the paper
were not starting a knife fight in the crimson
were not suing
because we are gentlemen of harvard
this is harvard were you dont plant stories and you dont sue people
you thought he was UNknown be the only one that thought that was stupid ?
during the time when you say you had this idea
did you know UNknown and cameron came for a family of means ?
a family of means ?
did you know their father was wealthy ?
i not sure why your asking me that
its not important that you be sure why i am asking
not important to you
i had no idea weather they came from money or not
in one of your lead ups mr UNknown you UNknown howard UNknown consulting firm
if you say so
you also knew tyler and cameron were members of the harvard finals club called the UNknown
you pointed that out
to the bike room
eduardo was the president of the harvard UNknown association and he was also my best friend

doesnt matter ?
nice to meet you maybe we can go out get a drink
the second is that we can all go out for a drink
this is so great
they want to have drinks later
have you ever heard so many good things packed into one regular sized sentence
excuse me mark ?
you know i can swear he was looking at you
when he said the next bill gates could be right in this room
i doubt it
you want to walk
you hear what i just said ?
what does that mean ?
it means its time for the web site generate revenue
i know the word i am asking is how you want to do it
because facebook is a cool
and if we start selling pop ups for mountain dew
well i UNknown thinking mountain dew mountain dew but but at some point i am talking as the business end of the company
we dont even know what it is yet what it is
we dont know what it can be we dont know what it will be we know that its cool that is a priceless asset im not giving up
so when will it be finished
it wont be finished
your talking about fashion ?
ok they manage to make money selling UNknown
mark what is this ?
what were their names
about ten days ago right after we launched the site
hey the girls
it says the UNknown twins are saying that you stole their ideas
i find that to be a little more then mildly annoying
they find it to be intellectual property theft
why didnt you show this to me ?
it was UNknown to me
their saying we stole the facebook from david UNknown and the UNknown twins
i know what it says
look at me
no it says i could face legal action
this from a lawyer mark they must feel they have some grounds
the lawyer is their fathers house counsel
do they have grounds ?
the grounds are our thing is cool and popular and harvard connection is lame
UNknown i didnt use any of their code i UNknown i didnt use anything
look a guy who builds a nice chair doesnt owe money to everyone UNknown ever built a a chair
look they came to me with an idea i had a better one
why dont you show me this letter ?
i didnt think it was a big deal
is there something wrong
you can tell me
this is our thing
i went to UNknown student legal services and they told me to write them back
and what did you say ?
when we met in january i expressed my doubts about the site were it stood with UNknown how much UNknown was left that i had not anticipated
lack of hardware we had UNknown use and promotion and the to go on to UNknown launch the web site
this is your first time to you raised any of those concerns right
i raised concerns before
im talking about the UNknown in january to which this letter is UNknown
the first 15 you didnt raise any concerns
is that a question ?
in the 16th UNknown you raised concerns about site UNknown
were you leading them on for six weeks
i had to swear an oath before i began this deposition and i dont want to UNknown myself so i have a legal obligation to say no
the rest of my attention is back at the offices of facebook
were my colleagues and i are doing thing that no one in this room including and especially your clients are UNknown or UNknown capable of doing
does that UNknown answer your UNknown question ?
i have 12 45 why dont we say thats lunch
back at two thirty
their names were christie and alice
and they want to have drinks tonight
hey man sorry a couple of girls are UNknown up in there
where are you going ?
mine too can i talk to you alone for a UNknown ?
i think im good right here
if we could talk outside
right here is fine
thats why i wanted to talk to you
on the internet
comparing women to farm animals ?
i did 'n t end up doing that
did 'n t stop you from writing it
its as if every thought that UNknown through your head is so clever
it would be a crime for it not to be shared
the UNknown not written in pencil mark
its written in ink
right before you made an ignorant crack about my families name
and bra size then rated women based on their UNknown
erica is there a problem
no theres no problem
it was nice to see you
dont torture me for it
if we could just go somewhere for a minute
i do not want to be rude to my friends
yeah that was great that was the right thing to do you UNknown right
we have to expand
ok we are UNknown to to yale and columbia
somebody at the newspaper will be a computer science major tell him
mark UNknown will do ten hours of free UNknown
why do you want a story in the bu newspaper ?
because i do
UNknown is a vice president and head of UNknown and his 5 of the company will come from my end
chris is director of publicity and his UNknown will depend on the amount of work he ends up doing
any questions ?
sorry they are christie and alice
you dont want any lunch ?
no thank you
i mean what do you do ?
i am a UNknown year associate at the firm
my boss wanted me to sit in on the deposition case
what are you doing ?

things did 'n t work ou the way they were supposed to for them
he is UNknown
i want to hire a lawyer to file for UNknown UNknown it the site taken down now
every minute the site is up harvard UNknown becomes less valuable
i want an UNknown i want damages i want UNknown release
i want him dead
then why are 'n t we doing anything about it
because we are a gentleman at harvard ?
because your not thinking about how its gonna look UNknown it gonna look
like my brother and i are in skeleton costumes chasing the karate kid around a high school gym
he goes to connecticut new york and to california he will have violated federal law
by the way hes in violation of harvard law
theres no such thing as harvard law
some where in this book it says you cant steal from another student

or or UNknown use will result in UNknown action including required UNknown from the college you UNknown that instead of doing what what my brother came and
i came here to ask you respectfully
i dont see this as a UNknown issue
mark UNknown walked into our dorm room and stole our computer that would be a UNknown issue
i was the us treasury secretary
im in some position to make that call
letting our UNknown run away with us
so i suggest again that the 2 of you come up with a new new project
i 'm sorry sir
ann how did i get this appointment
colleagues of their father
this action this meeting
its not worthy of harvard
its not what harvard saw in you
you dont get special treatment
we never asked
like were UNknown a UNknown for a science fair
if you have a problem with that mr UNknown
we never asked for special treatment
the courts UNknown at your disposal
is there anything else i can do for you
eduardo spring break you and mr UNknown took a trip to UNknown york
well as UNknown
mark was asleep
i wish he was asleep
so were at 29 schools now with over UNknown members
was 'n t a tick
would you say that mark was excited about this meeting
unless your the ballet theatre of hartford the purpose of business is to make a profit
it is 'n t a business yet
he can be late
what is he ?
i honestly was 'n t jealous
i was nervous why
but i had done a search and asked around and he
he struck me as a kind of an
he also founded the companies
we dont need him
nice to meet you
tuna tartar and the lobster claws that UNknown l get us started
christie what do you like to drink
an UNknown great 4 of those
from that point on it was a UNknown
the question was what did you talk about
he took through his episode with UNknown
i did 'n t want to spend my 20 's as a UNknown defender
who knew that in the UNknown of UNknown
they tried to sell the company to pay the 35 million they said we owed in UNknown but i guess to them that was a little like
selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas
so we said screw it and declared bankruptcy
you made a name for yourself
and you are dry
im not a psychiatrist
your not a psychiatrist but what a psychiatrist would say that he was paranoid
they hired private detective who followed me day and night
there were targets for high UNknown escorts
i cant prove it but i know they tapped my phone
so i figured im gonna trip you up UNknown done all this
you did 'n t bring down the record companies
he told story after story about
pretty soon all the UNknown kids were seeing their UNknown on our site and we were in
its called the little UNknown its smart mark
thanks that was mine
i say its time to start making money through the facebook but mark does 'n t want to advertise UNknown right well neither of you yet
the facebook is cool thats what its got going for it you dont want to ruin it with adds because adds are 'n t cool
how big it can get how far it can go
this is no time to put your chips down
a million dollars isnt cool you know whats cool
no hes holding a 3000 pound UNknown
have you seen the big ones up close
no i have 'n t but looking at the guy holding a UNknown the size of a UNknown that would be a really big fish and a very strong guy
i think you might be getting away from the point
i dont have a dog in this fight i just came to say hi
he owned mark after that dinner
he picked up the check and he told mark that they would talk together soon and he was gone but not before he made his biggest contribution to the company
drop the the just facebook
thats gotta be some kind of UNknown record for talking
you want to end the party at 11
im trying to pay for the party there wont be a party unless its cool
yeah sure lets drop the the
i meant catching the UNknown instead of 14 trout does 'n t that sound good
if your a trout
you can mark it
yes thank you
you were 'n t
oh come on man this is bullshit it another club playing a prank
i 'd gotten into the UNknown as as part of my UNknown i had to for 1 week carry with me at all times and take care of a chicken
they identified you as 1 of the UNknown of facebook jr eduardo UNknown
im not the expert but i think torturing animals was bad for business
i did not torture the chicken i dont torture chickens are you crazy no now settle down please
i have here an article from the UNknown
this is UNknown
this is college
the dining hall was serving chicken for dinner so i had to feed my chicken so wha i took little pieces of chicken and i gave it to the chicken
someone must have seen cause the next thing i knew i was accused of forced UNknown
i did 'n t know you could 'n t do that
i dealt with various animal rights groups
i dealt with the associate dean at the college this was all resolved
someone from the fly or the UNknown must have reported it for all i know it was the UNknown 's allright lets just forget about it
this is absurd
it is better to be accused of UNknown
im gonna have to explain this to my father im UNknown have to explain this to everybody what is UNknown on that
i have my final coming up for post war and contemporary art and i UNknown been to class
im supposed to write about those 4 paintings
thats a facebook page
i posted the paintings and asked people to comment
every once in awhile i hop and stir the pot to get a good debate going
was mr UNknown cheating on his final exam
i d rather not answer that question and why not cause im not suing him for cheating on his final exam
thats not what UNknown do well you just told us he was cheating
no he did 'n t tell us about it at all our UNknown are capable of finding a UNknown article
in fact when we raised the subject he defended you
so 993 we are so close
oh yeah that remind me were gonna need more money
i UNknown more UNknown UNknown
im interviewing 2 UNknown to come to paulo alto and we are going to have to pay them something sorry what
i already found a house for rent on a street 2 blocks from the stanford campus its perfect and its gotta pool
when did you decide to go to UNknown for the summer
you mean when did i actually decide
somewhere in the middle of the sean parker variety UNknown
he was right california is the place we gotta be
what your jed UNknown
what is your problem with sean
he doesnt bring anything to the table doesnt have money UNknown a better UNknown
hes got connections got connections to UNknown
if we need UNknown i have connections to UNknown
the real players and as someone UNknown just really UNknown the company in a bad way
it was the UNknown 's mark
hang on hit refresh
who came up with nothing enough to get him out of the company the drugs the girls

our sources also tell us paws recently tried to eliminate this pigeon UNknown
we find him he can lead us to her
we have less than two days to find kitty before she UNknown her call of the wild

it 's just impossible to find good help these days
that rat with wings has vital information that could destroy my entire plan
we cannot let that happen now can we little UNknown ?
i want this pigeon UNknown in your mouth on my doorstep immediately

my brain is the size of a grape !
or a UNknown

contrary to your belief all cats aren 't evil
we care about humans as much as you do
kitty wants revenge on dogs and humans and that is why she must be stopped

i 'm sorry
unless you turn into a parrot never talk in front of humans !

at least they 'r e not wearing UNknown
the wife is at the UNknown today so i 'm watching the litter
let 's go !
and when i say fat cat i mean you might wanna switch to the UNknown milk
it takes a dog to chase a cat
it 's about protecting the humans
she 's right
cats and dogs will have to work together
we chase them
we can 't just work with cats
we can 't trust them
what do these guys want from me ?
i can 't work with a cat
but i don 't wanna go back to the kennel
you ever live in a cage my friend ?
man i wish i was back with my partner shane

it 's just miserable but i like the
hey UNknown UNknown
oh what a cute
lf you were to build a doomsday device
you UNknown l never find love you know
i can tell by the way you 'r e sitting
so apart from the others
they wouldn 't invite any ordinary cat would they ?
naughty little girl
someone dedicated driven and very angry
but at who ?
that 's enough !
listen here you UNknown cat
we 'r e here to talk about kitty galore
who the heck are you ?
that bulge under your left ear
you were UNknown with a UNknown UNknown
i 'm guessing police work

the last bird who stood this close to me well i enjoyed his company with a plate of fancy feast and a nice saucer of milk
th th th th
originally i was thinking yellow but yellow 's so obvious
what is the world coming to ?
cats and dogs can 't work together !
what to do ?
i always wondered what UNknown would look like in a dress
betrayed by my own kind
i guess it 's just you and me UNknown
kitty now watch carefully
now let 's see
the crowd UNknown and UNknown as i put sword d into slot seven ?
and then i say the magic words abracadabra
where 's kitty galore ?
look i can 't help you fight other villains all right ?
it 's a professional courtesy thing
i 'd be UNknown laughed at
i 'd lose my pension
however i will say this
a cat 's eye reveals everything
it 's a riddle sherlock
i was trying to be mysterious
oh never mind
an evil genius doesn 't need good luck
although i could use a passport and a UNknown
a cat 's eye reveals everything
that don 't even make no sense
tinkles doesn 't know where kitty galore is
he 's UNknown he 's UNknown
in other words your typical UNknown
UNknown is chasing a ball when it 's just gonna be thrown again
what a pointless activity
would you two please muzzle it ?
now where is that stupid bird kitty wants us to knock off ?
let me see
after the mission can we get ice cream ?
yes yes yes we can get ice cream
now be quiet !
need a little help !
now don 't move a paw !

i was just having a wee bit of fun
catherine snap out of it
i 'm sorry
oh god i can 't even look at it
i wanna help you but
here goes nothing !
preparing the call of the wild
soon your feeble UNknown brains will feel her wrath and UNknown will crumble !
smack him around !
kitty knows your pal nicky gave you the blueprints
i got him pops
first you let the carrier pigeon get away
then you almost drowned us in kitty litter
and now you UNknown e let the UNknown escape !
well i didn 't blow up the ferry
i mean that 's something
i UNknown e had it with you
you 'r e UNknown
what are you saying ?
i 'm saying go home UNknown
you 'r e off this team
i don 't wanna be rude but the bird 's still all good right ?
come on UNknown
what about you ?
i need to check in with meows first
uh i do have to check in with meows
hey you 'r e hurt
no i 'm fine
you 'r e coming with me to get fixed up
sir you haven 't seen this dog have you ?
where is that stupid pigeon ?
i don 't know
what do you say there kitty ?
and where have you been ?
hey calm down
now no one can stand in my way
come on UNknown
lf my nieces give you any trouble
and he 's a doggy !
this is too adorable for my taste
no that 's just a myth
all right girls
oh it 's just a little splinter
yeah they 'r e unbelievable
i mean i 'm a dog
i can 't believe they don 't hate me
well i guess they haven 't learned to yet
anyway listen thanks for fixing me up
i should be heading home now
home huh ?
oh uh well it was over at the
you know i 'm kind of between homes right now so i UNknown l probably just
i UNknown l just head back to the kennel
the kennel ?
i guess i was just a pup when i first got dropped off
my owner said he 'd be right back but
well how did you finally get out ?
my man shane
made me his partner
there was no way i was ever gonna wind up in the kennel again
and then what ?
no matter how hard i try i just keep messing things up
or blowing things up
but it 's not like i don 't wanna follow orders
it 's just i learned pretty early on that the only one i could count on the only one i could really trust was me
that way no one could ever let me down
yeah but no one can help you either
try and stop me !
oh man here we go again
i was born in a box bigger than this
you still have seven lives left
okay UNknown no barking no drooling and definitely no chasing my colleagues
tab agent 47 reporting for duty
i 'm fighting the urge to chase you
no no tab he 's cool
he 's with me
stand down brigadier
he looks UNknown to me
we UNknown e isolated a voice on kitty galore 's threat recording
tinkles was right
can i ask you something ?
don 't take this wrong
you know that saying cat got your tongue ?
yeah yeah yeah !
now be a good dog and stick your head out the window
so how exactly are we planning on getting in there ?
butch taught me this
look for something that resembles a bologna with a head
what the ?
cats and dogs working together ?
call me old fashioned but i preferred it when we all hated each other
don 't worry
scratch that two rubber bands !
what a lucky
you UNknown l ruin this place
my insurance doesn 't cover this
this is why my landlord said no pets
well always great having you over butch
you 'r e the life of the party
hey what 's kitty galore 's name doing on my wallpaper ?
this is worse than we thought !
she 's trying to get free UNknown
this is why kitty 's after you
your cousin nicky stashed this here
holy lawn log
if this device is real it 's our worst fears come true
lou meows here
she 's with one of your agents
you 'r e looking for one chuck the magnificent
tab i 'm sending you a blueprint
butch go get our agent
copy that !
in a circus tent chained to a cat
great master plan kitty
you see in 20 minutes i will begin broadcasting the call of the wild !
and every UNknown on this planet will become a mad dog forever !
like i 'm supposed to believe a bunch of weird sounds are gonna make me a mad dog forever
you know for a dog
a dog 's sensitive hearing has always been considered a tactical advantage
but now it will be their downfall
they 'r e even turning on their owners
humans have no idea what 's happened
their dogs have all gone mad !
and there 's only one place for a mad dog
where they will be forever alone UNknown unloved
seem familiar officer UNknown ?
nice try kitty
what are you gonna do go door to door with your sound ?
that would take you the rest of your nine lives
that 's true
why do you think i UNknown e been telling you this ?
i got time to kill until my satellite 's in position
then once i beam the signal it will instantly broadcast from every tv radio and cell phone on earth !
okay show 's over
i was hoping someone would say i UNknown l never get away with this
it UNknown l make it so much more satisfying when i do !
now sit back and relax
perhaps you 'd care for a drink of water ?
i want you to drown !
oh if there 's one ride we should go on it 's the roller coaster
we 'r e not going on any rides
don 't be scared
there i said it
no stop !
no it doesn 't do anything
it 's not even good for fleas
no if i could just get it loose i can pick the lock
nice work !
come on catherine

where are you girl ?
chuck you 'r e a grade a UNknown
here they are
we can get through this together
the show must go on !

oh my lord !
as soon as my satellite is in position i hit the button and UNknown the signal !
i love being a spy dog !
brakes brakes brakes

and bring UNknown before me in chains
governor you 'r e the politician i 'm just a simple soldier
but i 'm not so simple that i can 't see you 'r e looking for a way back to rome
my bones ache for rome
this place is the graveyard of ambition
the conquest of britain is a lost cause
with one bold stroke we could change all that
with the ninth legion at your command we can crush this enemy
you and your men could retire with wealth and honour
my men have honour enough
enough to disobey a direct order ?
i need to find UNknown
for that i have someone special in mind
can 't speak a word but she can hunt anything over any terrain
i swear she 's part wolf
i apologise for the UNknown but i wanted to prove a point
slaves cost nothing
she 's mute not deaf !
i have my own scouts
UNknown not like her !
she knows the UNknown
she will guide you into the mountains
she 's been looking at you all night
i UNknown e spotted it
can 't take her eyes off you
come on you
she 's got no tongue in her head you fool
i wouldn 't get too close
no tongue that 's perfect she UNknown l have more room for this
UNknown you be careful
she must be a good scout if she can find your cock
i think it 's love
i UNknown l have a go with the mutt this time
i think he might be roman
UNknown centurion remus take the column !
shouting in UNknown
we can 't take prisoners on the march
you know what to do
head or ship ?
not the gods you should thank
it 's her
i 'm quintus UNknown
well sorry we couldn 't get here sooner
are you the relief column ?
we UNknown e come here looking for a fight
then you UNknown l get one
how do you feel ?
cuts and bruises sir
well sometimes there are scars that cannot be seen
you escaped the clutches of UNknown but i must ask you to return with us into the lion 's den
best to get back into the fight general
spoken like a soldier
i saw him win the fight that earned him his freedom
he was magnificent
come meet the men
i think he deserves it
come and join us
perhaps you can teach me something about UNknown hospitality
if they ever catch me i 'm fucked !
well in training he is our scholar at the feast he is our father in the ranks he is our brother
and in battle he is the god we pray to save our souls
where did you read that ?
it 's written on the UNknown wall sir
probably wrote it himself
and i 'd die for him without hesitation
UNknown it 's a trap !
UNknown column !
tell centurion remus to pull the column back
make a hole
can you make it ?
only you ?
are we all that 's left ?
we were UNknown
he deserves a nobler tomb than this
the general 's still alive
are you sure ?
which way ?
they UNknown l have patrols sweeping these forests for survivors
we might as well slit our throats
if the general 's alive it 's our duty
from the kitchens
not any more
ditch your armour
how do you know that ?
we make the food we know everything
i know where they UNknown e taken the general
to the UNknown eye they look similar to these which are delicious
it was given to me
what 's your real name ?
i doubt you could pronounce it
it 's from the mountains of the hindu UNknown where i was born
UNknown right ?
where are you from UNknown ?
i 'm from the army
it 's all i UNknown e ever known
they picked me up from the street trained me told me i could better myself
so tell me UNknown
didn 't stop until i reached greece
then i ran for sport
now i 'm running for my life again
we 'r e all a long way from home
this was supposed to be my last tour
still could be
short sir for UNknown
she was a fucking comedian
get some sleep
with your gods
do you know why ?
she was a child when she came to us seeking sanctuary
her own village had been slaughtered as punishment for resisting roman rule
to set an example they burnt out her father 's eyes
they raped her mother until she was begging to die
UNknown was forced to watch before she too was raped
and finally they cut out her tongue that she may not speak ill of the bloody roman empire
she fled north and came to us for shelter
we raised her and made her one of our own
and when she came of age we sent her back to you to UNknown allegiance and deliver you into our hands
when it 's dark we go in
what 's left of the legion is yours to command
where 's UNknown ?
i UNknown e got the general 's helmet
where is he ?
before you die know that the men who did this will not live to tell your tale
well let 's get on with it then
your roman friends should have known cold iron does not bend
do you fear me ?
no man brave enough ?
on foot over this ?
where they may hesitate we must go
we keep moving
and that 's where they UNknown l be looking for us
look we can 't outrun them
so we have to outsmart them
we head north throw them off our trail then double back west then south
it may take days even weeks
but we 'r e so far behind enemy lines it 's our only chance of getting home
come on !
shouting in UNknown
come take him
just say the word and i UNknown l take care of it
we live united or die divided starting with you
you can stick this out if you want but first chance i get i 'm taking care of myself
it 's your funeral
what is that ?
try it it 's good
what 's wrong ?
come on get up !
groaning come on !
they 'r e closing
UNknown no !
do it !
come on up
that 's it
it 's not magic she 's a UNknown
and she 's UNknown of us
what 's happening ?
they don 't care if we know where they are
but she won 't expect it us
UNknown watch over leo
going to even the odds
they 'r e not defending their lives or their country any more
they UNknown e sworn a blood vengeance against us
and they won 't rest until we beg them for death
are you ready to get on your knees and beg ?
i 'm finished
hopeless is the stuff of legend UNknown
and being a legend will get you laid
keep moving while we still have darkness on our side
the gods have forsaken us
we make our own chances now
i can 't keep up
they UNknown l end it quicker if you don 't cry out
don 't leave me !
we need food and a place to rest
where the hell are we now ?
i UNknown l get some water
you speak my language
i thought you 'd stopped coming up this far north
they come here ?
i do what i can to discourage them
they think i 'm a UNknown and they leave me alone
it usually works on the others
why not you ?
we were 3 000 and now we are three
UNknown there 's a roman garrison two days from here
it must be the western frontier post at UNknown
two days ?
quintus what 's she doing ?
she 's a UNknown and a woman
two good reasons not to trust her !
whispers death caps ?
has our witch worked her magic ?
whispers quintus the mushrooms
why heal your leg only to kill you ?
death caps have white gills
it pays to know your mushrooms
they ought to be
a demon ?
that 's comforting
only roman blood can fill it
are you ok ?
where i come from it 's considered rude to interrupt a man UNknown
where i come from it 's considered only fair to warn a man when he 's UNknown on his breakfast
hide in the grain store and don 't make a sound
we UNknown l leave
stay until morning and your friend will be fit to travel
these are your people
not since UNknown accused me of UNknown and gave me this to mark me as an outcast and banished me to live out my days here alone
i 'm sorry i misjudged you
there it is
here 's some food for the journey
look hot food and a dry bed
giving up the ground we fought for
and where does that leave us ?
i don 't know about you but i 'm tired of running
this is all i could find
make them count
west wall !
i don 't know
oh shit !
UNknown we thought you were dead
where 's UNknown ?
hey at least the three of us made it !
we 'r e not home yet
what are you talking about ?
we should be at the frontier by now
can 't say that i 'm sorry
then we fought for nothing
i UNknown e no idea what you 'r e talking about
this is UNknown 's big fucking plan ?
a wall ?
just making sure that we understand each other
i understand that many good men died because of what you did and you will answer for it
why did i just know you were going to feel that way ?
you fought your war soldier and earned the gratitude of rome
this man will show you to my private quarters he will see you fed
you look half starved
better that the fate of the legion remain a mystery than the truth of their failure be known
if word gets out every tribe and every nation will rise against us
it 's too great a risk
are we agreed then ?
the fate of the ninth legion will be struck from the record
i UNknown e brought you some wine
it is the least we can do for a hero of rome
is this how rome honours her heroes ?
you want to bury the truth and me along with it ?
you are too much of a risk
where will you go ?
where i belong

i 'm sorry i 'm not prepared at all
i feel very honoured that coach asked me to do this but
i also feel terrible because i haven 't seen the coach in so long
and he always wanted me to come to town and see him and i got caught up in what i UNknown e been doing and i regret it
but those guys had a skill you never mastered
they knew how to pass the ball
looks like somebody has to learn how to pass the kentucky fried chicken
i 'm kidding i 'm kidding

and everybody on that list has been ordered killed
don 't you see ?
he 's trying to clean up his past and get rid of me in one shot
he 's trying to cut me loose before he runs for president
we have some major activity out here
looks like we 'r e blown
we 'r e in positions perimeter is set
no ones getting away
are you going to let me talk to them ?
i can negotiate something
listen plastic man
i hope so
i 'm scum ?
i have people killed i 'm the bad guy remember ?
not worth the bullet
it 's been a real blast
if we have to come in there and get you it 's going to be messy
you bet real messy
they come from the vice president ?
he 's ordered these hits to cover the war crimes he 's UNknown while in UNknown
i find that hard to believe
how did you know you 'd find me here ?
some anonymous UNknown tip ?
here 's the deal frank
you 'r e gonna walk out that front door and give yourself up
you have my word no one will shoot you
i will personally take you in and you get to tell your side of the story
you got 60 seconds to decide
what 's it look like ?
there 's no clean exit
they seem to be coming from everywhere
we 'r e running out of options
if we have a distraction i could cover you to the woods
looks like there 's not alot of options kid
UNknown going to have to make the hard choice if we 'r e going to make it out of here alive
and well ?
i 'm coming out
get behind me
who fired the shot ?
tell me when the boys make cover we UNknown l move
we gotta move
did he just call you bunny ?
live sometimes is complicated
and what about frank 's girlfriend ?
they UNknown l kill her so fast i mean
first they UNknown l interrogate her they probably already got the wires then give her a little UNknown give her a jump
bring in the UNknown
i want to show you something
that has done to me by the love of my life
it seems that what we had was not meant to be
but now she sits outside my house drinking vodka
three bullets in the chest
when i woke alive
or else it would have been in the head
it was big risk for her of course but
one does crazy things for love
do not fear for your love my friend
with a small dedicated group there is nothing that cannot be accomplished
let me be blunt
you don 't exist
so why don 't you and i start talking ?
the trace is running
with age comes a certain perspective
i 'd be a UNknown if i said there wasn 't a time that i was exactly like you
blind ambition UNknown trust
it might help me to decide what to do next
keep him talking
our UNknown is very harmful
the killing the stress the bad pay didn 't bother me
well what was it frank ?
that anything that you love can be taken away from you
they tell you to never care never invest
then i met this woman
i can 't think of anything more horrible than to know that your enemies can hurt someone that you love
the feeling is almost UNknown
you still there cooper ?
you 'r e in my house
almost UNknown isn 't it ?
please don 't hurt my family
if anything happens to sarah i will rip everything you love out of your life
and then i UNknown l kill you
i UNknown l do whatever you want to keep sarah safe
we don 't have much time
do you understand that ?
what are you going to do frank ?
i 'm going to kill the vice president
what are you going to do ?
where did he get it from ?
the secure records UNknown of the cla
but he 's about to cross the line from which there is no turning back
right now you have an opportunity to help him
you need to tell me everything you know
because if i can 't stop him i 'm going to have to kill him
do you know who frank moses is ?
i mean really is ?
