when were you ever a high roller ?
well you know i told you i fed the city breakfast every morning
is that where all the high UNknown go ?
iceland is 6 hours from canada
the night club scene is intense and i thought i 'd take this chick to iceland
what 's her name ?
she was an ass model
you heard of hand models right for advertisements
she was an ass model
she did jeans and magazines and shit
anyway it was a fashion week in new york and a
i took her to iceland
UNknown UNknown ass model iceland
you took her to the ice
for 500 they take you on a dogs sledge ride in the UNknown
and you know the whole saying if your not the lead dog the view never changes ?
right otherwise your always looking at the asshole of the dog in front of you
that would be funny if i get to that part
did it hit you ?
shit always hit 's you man !
you know when i went to prison later on which you called
i had trouble going to the toilet you know privacy thing and i
i couldn 't take a shit i was scared UNknown literally
so you know what i thought of ?
you thought of the dog !
i thought if that dog could do what it needed to do so could i
saved my fucking life !
it 's like you and i
i knew exactly how it was going to start
yeah but do you know how it 's going to end ?
call me when the money comes in
i don 't know what he looks like but he sounds good
fucking talk 's shit ?
he 's got a sexy voice man he can be my bitch in prison

i think that 's him
ryder listen to me !
we made a mistake it 's my fault !
the cars hit that 's why the
get back in line !
ryder one minute it 's going to take
don 't do this for god 's sake !
it 's the only plan i UNknown e got !
it was an accident !
it was an accident ryder !
it was an accident ryder !
UNknown team 1 to sniper 1
do you have a shot ?
that 's your fault !
just got bit by a fucking rat !
who who go shot ?
ryder are you there ?
shoot any mother fucker that moves !
it 's an order !
can you hear me ryder ?
okay now somebody else has to die !
two people maybe all of us !
did you hear me ?
i heard you but you got to understand
the circumstances they 'r e different now for you
you gotta re think this you gotta adapt
no i gave instructions and you know the consequences !
the plan b was UNknown plan a !
the minute you stop believing me mother fucker !
i believe you but you gotta believe and understand that those cops are gonna be down that tunnel and next to you any second
let them come i don 't care !
what 's the point of that huh ?
what 's the point of that
i told you we all owe god a death and now it 's 2 minutes past the deadline
2 minutes ! which means 2 people almost 3 have to go
the money 's there ryder
nobody else has to die
i don 't know what you owe god but i can tell you you can 't pay him in cash
you can 't take the money with you !
all this talk of god
i think i need to pray
what 's the reality of getting in there and ending this ?
we have to except heavy casualties on all sides it 's a hard choice but i say make it !
new york city does not have an acceptable casualty rate
now this is your area of UNknown
chester man here just confessed to a felony 20 minutes ago
in my opinion there are people down there who are alive because of him
until we change the rules or hope runs out we should stick with the situation we have now
he said i should trust in him all others pay cash how soon can you get it down here
from the next station it would take them about 5 minutes to walk it down
10 minutes to walk it down
how long would it take you to come down here ?
what do you mean me ?
i want to meet you garber
if you bring it i know the cops aren 't bringing it
i don 't know how i 'm going to carry that money i mean it must weigh
220 pounds stick it in a fucking wheel barrow or something
why we discussing weight ?
shouldn 't you be thinking get the fuck outta there ?
now look plan b your idea and part of plan b is you garber deliver that money !
or i kill another hostage you got that ?
you got seven minutes buddy boy
you got 6 minutes and 55 seconds check me
and tell that UNknown bag UNknown to call me when you got the money
you don 't have to do this

i 'm at a a UNknown
it 's real simple there 's nothing to it
what it is is he know 's i 'm not a cop so he wants me to come down
is it okay if i wait here ?
can i wait here ?
they need me to take the money down there because they know i 'm not a cop and a
you know they saying they might kill somebody
well then somebody has to die
just tell angela to meet when she runs over the UNknown tell her to run straight to the UNknown tomorrow

i love you so much !
would you love me back ?
i can 't really talk right now
all you have to say is yes
it 's alot less than saying i can 't talk
i 'm having a really fucking weird day
we 'd anticipated this we could have made alot of money
what kind of guy would you expect to take a model to iceland
the radio set up to the train ?
it 's set up back there you can talk directly to the train or to rail control
just do everything he say 's and remember everything you see
pelham 1 2 3 come in

mr garber is in the tunnel the money is 2 minutes away
mr garber is a dependable man
how about you ryder ? everybody s got some good in them don 't you think ?
is this the part where you try to get through to me ?
i don 't think so mother fucker !
i want you to clear the local track 's from UNknown street down to coney island and when i say clear i don 't wanna see no cops
don 't play games with me or i UNknown l track you down and fuck you and your grease ball ass mother fucker !
it 's real simple okay
you just aim at anything you don 't like and you pull the trigger got that ?
what if they frisk me ?
it 's got a false bottom just gotta do this
don 't worry about it
just don 't fuck it up
he was released from UNknown 2 weeks ago
did a 9 year stretch the last 4 in the same cell block as phil ramos
he 's name shows up on an icelandic air passengers list in september of UNknown right after fashion week
we used he 's case when he was running as an example
the kind of nonsense we would clean up if i ever get elected mayor yeah
20 million dollars he did a plea bargain for 3 judge gave him 10
maybe that 's why he 's so pissed off !
the judge gave him 10 years because we didn 't recover all of the city 's money
there was a couple of million UNknown for it was the siege money
he played the terrorist card
you panic the market into a drop
if you know what 's coming you can make a great deal of money with 2 million dollars
what about the hostage money ?
are you kidding that 's nothing compared to the money you can make in the market
let 's get down town get to the UNknown
when you put your socks on this morning did you ever think
turn around let him frisk you ?
i was worried about you
i thought maybe you UNknown l get lost then i remembered you were a UNknown so
these tunnels don 't change much do they ?
just the people in them
alright come on up !
damn your taller than i thought you 'd be
it 's nice to meet you
what do you weigh about 220 ?
err yeah i 'm a 220 on a good day
so how long has it been since you UNknown e driven one of these ?
that 's why you brought me down here ?
well your a UNknown right ? once a UNknown always a UNknown
play your cards right you might get part of the cut
this is a new train i 'm not certified on a new train
but i UNknown e got faith in you man
let me ask you one question
you know that saying when you told your wife about the UNknown how did she react ?
look we gotta talk about it ?
i 'm not being sensitive ?
did she freak out or what ?
she wasn 't happy but she understood
well that 's love right ?
no that 's marriage that 's another thing
so what 's the deal ? you think they 'r e going to move the train ?
how we covered with street level exits and emergency exits ?
i got a blanket on the UNknown !
i got radios cars manned on every exit from 42nd to south ferry
hey grease ball speak up !
i see red i don 't see green
what 's taking so fucking long ?
the blanket is not tucked in yet
you have to stall i need 2 minutes buy me two minutes
they haven 't cleared the tracks yet
yes sir i got it
let 's roll let 's roll
yeah i 'm bluffing man
you got to say what you got to say
you thought by coming down here you 'd be UNknown didn 't you ?
you 'r e more fucked up than i am
let 's go let 's go let 's go
she 's on the move
put some speed on it
you 'r e playing with fire my man
i want to see them green
change them to green or i UNknown l put a hole in garber 's head right now
believe me we are moving as fast as we can
what happens if they run a red light ?
it will trip the brakes
that 's what i 'm looking for
that 's what i 'm looking for
here he comes right now
your man garber is driving the train
so what are you saying he 's in on it !
there is no fucking way
the sniper killed ramos he was their driver so they probably need garber to drive
when they get to coney island they gonna hit the trip and the brakes are gonna come on
how far to the signal ?
about a tenth of a mile
stop when you get there we 'r e moving out ?
are they slowing down ?
they have to they 'r e coming up to the signal point
you 'r e the old UNknown
they stopped just below UNknown street !
what the hell are they doing ?
train has to stop at signal points
some kind of an UNknown ?
yeah yeah some kind of an UNknown
here we go okay lets move out
now 's the time of running
why that little stop huh ?
i told you signal the points
how do you know they didn 't set the throttle and jump out ?
doesn 't matter doesn 't matter we UNknown e got every exit covered
there 's no where to go
listen the throttle can 't be set it has to be held
it 's a fail safe it 's a dead UNknown switch
if it doesn 't have a man 's hand pressing down on it the train stops cold
believe me they 'r e still on board
UNknown up the tracks come on !
it 's going to UNknown before it get 's to coney island
exit right there in front of you !
we need to find him !
we don 't have time
i fucking love you !
cops are seeing UNknown on the train nobody 's in the UNknown 's booth
it 's alright as soon as we pass through the red light the brakes will stop us automatically
yeah but they 'r e all green !
i really have to go take a piss
where was that stop that first stop that they made ?
that 's where the roosevelt was built
the what ? a derelict tunnel built under the waldorf hotel converse everything on that area
get out get out ! get out !
get out of the way !
here is walter garber UNknown

but you did a hell of a thing today
you went to bat for the city of new york and on behalf of me i 'd like to thank you
it 's been an amazing day everyone 's been thanking me all day but i appreciate it
i want you to know that tomorrow the city of new york is going to go to bat for you
i 'm going to get home

you know me subway all my life
i get home faster than you anyway
i mean not you but everybody else

we were going to buy football shoes
i will fetch you at home at 5 30
is she a relative of yours ?
no there is a guy in my class called UNknown
what did he say then ?
he just shook his head shut up and walked away
perhaps i 'm just imagining do you remember last midsummer
anna the photographer the neighbour
have you talked to johan about it ?
i 'm afraid of what he might say
they are working together and yet he becomes very strange when we meet all three of us
i guess i have become boring
what do you think ?
how about one more child ?
johan has always wanted three
we UNknown l have a baby
alice we were just talking
i would prefer a little sister but a little brother is fine too
we have to talk to dad
i 'm here to sell a horse and to visit your UNknown
i UNknown e got many new horses
i saw you were standing there and heard much more than what mom knows about
but i know your parents
they are two very nice people who have experienced many good things together
most of all they have you and UNknown
so i think it will turn out just fine
promise to visit me soon
say hello to the horses !
here you can take the boat all the way to lido
i tried to call but the damn mobile phone UNknown itself
nice isn 't it ?
what 's the matter ?
come on what 's the matter ?
alice pass the ball !
alice pass the ball !
dad pass the ball !
but i 'm so proud of you
what a girl eh ?
which one of them ?
do you want sausage ?
did you see my goals ?
yes you were better than the boys
mmm you 'r e the best
go and help dad with the sausages
doesn 't everyone believe that here ?
it 's perhaps for the best
we can 't go on like this anymore
it 's not really the right situation
but i don 't want it like this anymore
i 'm so terribly ashamed !
today you must choose tonight
i don 't want to be here anymore
i 'm not taking this anymore
it gets in my eyes
do you love mom ?
we are married mom and i
and we love our children
who has been in my bed papa UNknown said
when he saw that neither the pillow or the quilt lied where they used to
who has been in my bed mama muff said who found her bed in disorder
in little UNknown 's bed UNknown slept
she heard the voices of the bears and dreamt that UNknown 's voice was the thunder
and mama muff 's voice made her dream about murmuring brooks
i UNknown l sit here a little while
go out and close the door
may i have a piece of cake ?
what are you doing ?
i thought we could have a cosy evening
i said it 's alright
you said cosy evening ?
no i said she could have a piece of cake
i don 't need any
i thought you also wanted some
how long has this been going on ?
so that 's why we couldn 't go on vacation this summer
because you wanted to be close to her so that you could fuck her all summer !
how are the children going to find out ?
look dad UNknown on other women in front of the neighbours !
if you won 't tell i will !
we agreed to be careful with the children
if you don 't tell them tomorrow
you will tell them everything
if you forget something i will tell them
i can 't stand this shit anymore
the front door opens and slams
what the hell lotta ?
johan she could have killed us
i can 't live here anymore
what the hell is she doing to my home ?
why are you crying ?
it was such a horrible dream
what did you dream ?
yes you do don 't you ?
yes a hundred million thousand times
what are you doing up this late ?
please just like when i was little
what the hell are you doing ?
don 't you understand what you could have done ?
it 's a pity i missed but there will be more chances
what are you talking about ?
alice come and lie next to me
let 's lie here together
won 't you undress ?
no it 's so cold here
i will not come today
dad has something to tell
do you want to think it over ?
what are you waiting for ?
i want to talk to them UNknown
then i will tell them
as you well mom and i have quarrelled a lot lately
and we don 't know how to solve this
we become sad about this we can 't stand to have it like this
so i believe that the only thing we can do now
because we have tried to solve this
i think we should live in separate places
so you will take turns to be with us
it 's dad who wants to divorce
it 's he who wants to move out
but i want to be here to live here with you but it 's not working how things are now
tell them where you are going to live
i think it 's better if mom lives here with you
then i will live nearby so that you can be with me
and be with mom and then you can run between us
such a little UNknown !
tell them who you are going to live with
it 's perhaps not the right moment
what 's her name ?
when i was very sad
then i met someone who
because mom and i can 't talk and comfort each other anymore
then i met a woman who i like and feel good to be with
and she also liked being with me
and we have met for a while now and you also know who it is
she has been here eating and i
she lives just here nearby
anna in the green house
what are you doing ?
dad will be a father to UNknown
i will not be a father to UNknown
are we also going to divorce ?
i don 't know but dad will probably soon find out what a damn bitch she is
but what does mom say about this ?
that 's what bothersome about it
she just cries every night
does you dad live with you now ?
alice and hanna stop it !
that was the third time this week
what the hell are you doing ?
grown ups shouldn 't teach children to swear
should children do whatever they like ?
you both have always been best friends
alice we are going to solve this now
hanna lies about me in front of the others
what are you saying then hanna ?
hanna where does your dad live ?
in UNknown with his new wife
ok that 's the way it is then because you should know
and alice where does your dad live ?
at home but right now he is travelling
ok that 's the way it is then because you should know
do you understand hanna ?
if you have something on your mind
if you have problems you can talk to me
alice do you know if UNknown is still at school ?
i must go and look if UNknown is at school
alice may we be at your place today ?
i brought my brother 's new UNknown
mom and dad are not here
you are not allowed to be there
you can only be in my room
come here i want to talk to you alone
you bloody damn mean pussy !
why are your dad 's desk empty ?
because we will re paint
why are all the clothes gone ?
he is wearing them when travelling
your dad doesn 't live here anymore
we only have the car today
we must do it now
UNknown bicycle home before me
alice wait for me !
perhaps i can help you
let me talk a little
let me help you a little
it 's not what you think
yes but your dad hasn 't UNknown between you and me alice
he talks about you all the time
he misses you and your little brother so much it hurts
why are you saying that ?
because it serves him right
he is full of shit
you don 't mean that
you don 't know what i mean
i don 't know you that well yet
but i have seen you and your dad
full of shit who said that to you ?
not mom if you think so
i don 't think of anything about your mom
but mom never talks shit about dad as dad does about mom
i have never heard him do that
then you apparently have a bad hearing
i know only that your dad tries to do everything to make this work
good then there is no need to make a fuss
alice why are you doing this ?
she will kill you if she sees you
alice where have you been ?
where have you been ?
do you have to run into the woods like that ?
i become so worried when you disappear
call your parents and ask if you may
the phone is there to the left
why don 't you ask me first ?
because you would have said no
i know what 's best for you
they have been very mean
you haven 't told the truth
dad should be ashamed not you
let 's do something fun now
then you may have them
take the cucumber as well
i 'm down here at anna 's
i 'm helping her moving out
do you see me ?
can 't we meet quickly ?
he has to call later
mom says you have to call
i hear tell her i want to talk for a minute
he only wants to talk for a minute
tell her that i want to talk to her for 30 seconds just one thing
just one question mom !
see you just for a minute
i have to go to the toilet
i think of y ou and UNknown all the time
and i think of you dad
but couldn 't i have an old t shirt ?
please can 't you and mom be together again ?
let 's go out and talk a little
i notice that you are not feeling well
if you want to talk about it then we can do it
or we could just sit here in silence and think
then i guess i should be heading back to the others
i understand why you couldn 't say how it was
when i was just as old as you are now i experienced the same thing
i had so many questions but nobody to talk to
tell me how you feel
do you sympathize more with mom than with dad ?
but mom she has nobody
perhaps she has met someone
she may find someone to marry
mom is not like dad
but wouldn 't it be good if mom becomes happy that way ?
yes but she only becomes glad if dad comes to her
she loves dad so much she doesn 't know what to do
he will leave that anna and come back
was it a good conversation ?
it 's only between me and her
i 'm not asking what you were talking about
it feels like easier to breathe
let 's ignore that repulsive school food
we can 't hear UNknown
i will just take a melon first
are you finished mom ?
there is one thing i want you to understand
but hey do you understand ?
what 's she doing ?
why is she doing that ?
is she always like this ?
and then we hit a nail there
i know the eiffel tower !
we can do that one also
find a warmer jacket alice
please can you wait further away ?
no but do you think that it 's necessary to become enemies ?
it 's now you are needed as grandmother
but you have abandoned them
you can 't just tramp in here as if the house was still yours
what are you saying ?
i pay all the bills !
it 's lotta i have divorced not the children !
yeah right you want everything i can tell !
to eat the cookie and keep it
aren 't you happy with your new family ?
can 't you be satisfied with that then ?
what the hell are you saying ?
what should i do with the children ?
is this a grandmother who says so ?
UNknown them with you each second weekend then because you have the legal rights
you should be ashamed johan UNknown !
who the hell should be ashamed ?
henry was in a similar situation
yes but he left the children alone
life is what it is !
he left the children alone
how are those children ?
they have good contact now as grown ups
i have talked to them
i know what kind of contact they have with you two
i 'm not discussing my private life
but it obviously is alright discussing mine !
i don 't want to talk about mine
alice don 't bring such a thin jacket
you must have a thicker jacket
wasn 't you too UNknown ?
i know i just became so furious
do you have an UNknown ?
yes in my bag over there
say goodbye to grandma and grandpa
remember dad promised you to be alone
call if there is anything
do you hate dad ?
you should stay home on the holiday but go with dad otherwise there will be trouble
will you be with grandma and grandpa ?
i UNknown l call tonight
do that call as much as you want
have you checked him ?
i must give mom a hug
i just must hug mom !
you have promised us to be alone
if she will be there then mom will fetch me immediately
now we are really in a hurry
this is not my home
my home is with mom
but alice give me a break now
come and look it 's very nice
let 's light a fire grill sausages and
i don 't eat sausages
but you love sausages !
since when are you a vegetarian ?
since last week when we saw how they how UNknown feed pigs in school
it 's perhaps not nice to look at but vegetarian it
don 't jump on the sofa !
take off your shoes !
you can 't be a vegetarian now
you are only 12 years old and growing up
mom has already said yes
this is a thing that parents decide together
but now i 'm a vegetarian or will you force me to eat meet ?
dad what 's this ?
i don 't want you to die
i will not die for a long time
i think i want to die before you UNknown and mom
you don 't have to say things like that
none of us will die for a long time
we live together all the time we just live in different places
everything is just the same alice
the little fisherman didn 't care to listen to the one who lied to him
soon the men could on the beach neither see him nor the white stallion
they swam a long time and the white stallion who had UNknown powers
took UNknown with him to a wonderful island
UNknown sound in the next room
have you slept well ?
when did you arrive ?
just now with the morning ferry
what the hell are you doing here ?
what do you think about my pictures ?
i will have them on an exhibition now
it 's dad who lives here
yes and me and UNknown
and you and UNknown as often as you like
we live with my mom
here i am up with the rooster
i want to talk to you alone
i was just going to
in the cabin in the woods
i didn 't know what to do because i was afraid that
mom would be angry if i told her that anna will be here
i was afraid that she wouldn 't allow you to come here
and that 's why i didn 't say anything but i was just going to tell when anna came
not a fucking thing !
you only care about yourself
you give a damn about me !
i don 't know what to do
i just want everyone to be happy
i don 't want to be here
i want to go home to mom
but you just came here
can 't we be here a couple of days now then and
only a couple of days and then
don 't touch me !
don 't touch me !
we just have to give her time
to see such a bitch like me !
well now it must happen
i go out with the boots and the stuff to her
then you can dress UNknown and we will leave
why aren 't you answering mom ?
i don 't want to be here
dad promised us to be alone but the bitch is here
she is calling us bad words and dad just stands and watches
alice you will catch cold
we are going on an expedition
it would be fun if you join us
i will cut you when you are asleep
no it has to be this way
show UNknown your hut in the woods
do you want to see it ?
add to it a bit ?
dad let UNknown spin also
now i will chase UNknown
no i don 't want to
don 't you want ?
do you have to do this all the time
why are you doing this ?
but why are you doing this ?
what kind of man is this ?
do you have to show everything ?
the children can 't handle this
i 'm showing that i love you
but it isn 't forbidden ?
UNknown wait for me !
true love in the woods
where did you come from ?
from the sky i suppose
sorry i yelled a bit
let 's go on expedition
we can go down to the beach ourselves
we must do like this
you can also do this
how do you think he is handling everything with your mom and me and
have you called mom and told her that you want to leave ?
i want you to be here
will there be any food here ?
no there will be no food
yes we will eat in 15 minutes
you can taste my pancakes
mother 's are very delicious
don 't pay attention to her
i will make so delicious pancakes
we will have pancakes you see
this is not a good frying pan you see
i will just do this
i use to turn them in the air but now it doesn 't work
this is how to show things
then it usually doesn 't work as well
it gets stuck in the frying pan !
it 's that damn UNknown surface !
it becomes like this sometimes
now you UNknown l see
those damn fucking pancakes !
lie in your dad 's bed
that 's my mom 's
no it 's actually my dad 's
it 's my dad 's house
just as much my mom 's !
what are you doing ?
one at a time !
what 's the matter UNknown ?
i lied here first but must go
is this true alice ?
i want to be alone
go out on the veranda then
if UNknown lies here then alice must respect that
if you can 't agree then go out
shall alice be allowed to throw UNknown out ?
be sensible regarding the UNknown
we are five who feel different
i give a damn about this bed
well i UNknown l be damned
he thinks he UNknown over me
she thinks she decides over me
only my dad decides over me
but you don 't have any
are you stupid or what ?
he is a UNknown in canada
they think they can decide over us as we were little children
but we are actually 12 years old
what do you want then ?
everything to be as before
what do you want ?
i also want everything to be as before
come now i said !
what the hell are you doing ?
she has been cooking this for you
aren 't the pancakes to your taste ?
are you behaving like this at home ?
alice are you doing this to your mother ?
no but she isn 't my mother
don 't believe damn it
what are you saying ?
i don 't get it
you just can 't go away like this
then you give up then the children win
do you mean that we must conquer them ?
as a damn boxing match ?
i 'm just saying that we must give them more time
if someone has patience then it 's me
but how much shit do i have to take from your daughter ?
only alice who is the problem ?
but alice is so loaded with bullshit from your damn ex wife
can 't you see how she studies every move you do ?
you are a little sensitive now aren 't you ?
then i UNknown l say the same about UNknown
not a single bad word about my son !
you spit out shit about my daughter
damn yourself and your UNknown
go home to your wife
then you can relax !
without any problems at all !
go home to her !
run out to the woods then damn it !
the front door opens and slams
are you sitting here by yourself ?
i cannot go on any longer
but you don 't have to eat any more pancakes
i 'm tired i want to rest
shall we do something funny tomorrow ?
perhaps we should talk you and me
can 't you sleep here with me ?
you will sleep like a log
alice sorry i UNknown up before today
i 'm just like that
if i become angry then i become angry
but lots of goodies also
if i become glad then i become glad also
i just want to say that i think you are such a nice girl
i will tell you a secret
something not even johan knows about yet
before i got UNknown i expected another child a girl
the first time i felt her kicking inside my stomach
then i knew immediately that this was a little alice
i don 't know why i just knew
her name will be alice
but when i was going to give birth then there was something wrong so she died
i still don 't know what was the cause
then i meet a wonderful man and she has a girl called alice !
we had strange names back then
but his father didn 't want to admit that UNknown is his son
he doesn 't even want to talk to him
UNknown dreams about him all the time
there is a ghost in there
i 'm afraid i want to sleep with daddy
come i UNknown l go with you
what are they doing ?
why do you think it 's a ghost ?
there is someone out there
there is someone out there
what are you doing here ?
we came to collect the children
what are you saying ?
don 't take it personal
don 't be afraid anymore
put on your clothes alice
now tell your wife that she must tell me what the hell is going on
sonya we can 't just
don 't take it personal but when your own daughter asks for help
lotta was in despair when she heard alice 's cries for help
here is UNknown 's phone
you can hear what alice is saying
yes welcome to our cottage
hello my name is anna UNknown and i am johan 's wife
so far isn 't lotta johan 's wife ?
anna UNknown UNknown wife that is
my husband is very polite
i like that in a man
you were lucky who managed to avoid the rain
yes perhaps we can offer you a warming brandy ??
johan now you hear yourself how alice is with you
i didn 't mean all that
i was just so sad and UNknown
you don 't have to UNknown
you feel what you feel
i want to talk to lotta
you come in the middle of the night and pull up the kids who are sleeping
by consideration if you recognize that word
sonya UNknown and you talk about consideration ?
yes we came by taxi boat
perhaps it 's better that we let henry collect lotta
well perhaps we should also have a glass of brandy
i don 't want you to be sad
alice nothing that happened is your fault
yes because i said what i said in the phone and now mom has come here for me
but dad look what i 'm wearing
they are waiting for you now
you may go home this time
yes nothing more to it but i want you to go too
shall really me and UNknown ?
i 'm not going to stand on the UNknown for myself
don 't you want me to go there ?
we UNknown l not meet this weekend but the UNknown after that honey
oh my dear child !
how i have longed for you
how i have longed !
i have longed for you too !
anything particular you are angry with ?
that they are not listening
i love both mom and dad and want to be with both of them
but they always argue over the phone about where i should be and not be
what are you trying to say which they don 't listen to ?
i don 't want to feel myself as a letter which is thrown between two places
i want to feel secure wherever i am
do you remember we were fishing there last year ?
oh my god so great to see you !
have you been driving in a cab ?
the folding top broke down by the wind
and the stable it smells so good
i told you it was a long time ago you were here
UNknown bedroom and a small kitchen
we will like it here
won 't we alice ?
all these horses came by sea from iceland when they were 5 6 years old
when can they return back home then ?
no those are the regulations
and her name is UNknown
but the dads then ?
no they cannot see their dads again
hi i want to talk to dad
perhaps we will live here
mom and tina will perhaps open a business together
and we will check if the school is good here
the children are hungry and tired
alice can call you tonight
if you want something you can write a letter
why haven 't you told me ?
he has called lots of times
i haven 't talked to him
he has called lots of times
but i can 't take all the calls
i don 't have the strength to talk to him
he has left us alice
he has a new family
we must build something new without him
how are we supposed to do it if he is interrupting us all the time ?
don 't you want me to meet dad ?
of course and UNknown too
but he has hurt us so much that we need to be alone for a while
when he calls like that he is only thinking of his own good thinking of himself
if he was thinking about you then he would leave you alone
he has bad conscience just because he left us
if he would think about your own good then he wouldn 't force you
perhaps the children should rest a little
you and me can cook something
i UNknown l just finish
i want us to talk now
alice help UNknown finding UNknown
he is lying in there alice will help you
tina and i will cook something first
we UNknown l fetch you when the food is ready
i forgot my sweater in the car
don 't use the children as weapons
yes you are dear lotta
i UNknown to tell you how it is
she is old enough for the truth
yes she is old enough but still a child
which truth by the way ?
she is your daughter not your friend
not you either in that case
lotta this is what i 'm trying to be
it 's not that damn easy for me !
you called and told me that you and johan had agreed
but if i had ?
you are my friends both of you
besides i can 't stand watching how you force me to choose side
but not your side and not johan 's but the children 's
i can 't stand watching how you UNknown apart the relation that alice have to her father
you really take care of him
have you been together or something ?
haven 't you always looked at him ?
perhaps you were fucking already back then
is this the way you talk to everyone who has a different opinion regarding the children ?
don 't you talk to me about children
you stick to your damn horses !
i 'm sick and tired driving
i want to know where we are heading
if you don 't answer i will scream !
do as i say !
period nothing more to it
but that 's no answer
yes a very good answer !
if i say we are going then we are
but you don 't know where to go
if it 's okay that children may have an opinion then UNknown wants to say something
i don 't want to live in norway
i 'm sorry for all the mess
how did it feel coming back ?
UNknown and i have come closer
and anton and i have looked at UNknown but i don 't know if he likes me
come on ! reds !
my god so handsome !
what did he say ?
i know this is mom 's week
what 's the matter ?
he has been out here all night
do you know where he can be ?
when they lived in the green UNknown he was often in cabins in the wood
oh my god forgive me UNknown forgive me !
what did i say ?
26 27 28 29 30
i know what you are thinking now but perhaps nothing has happened
he can be somewhere else
but now let the professionals take over
mom is over there yes ?
no more kids in the wood !
i UNknown l call as soon as we know more
i can accompany UNknown back home
i saw anna said something to herself
forgive me UNknown forgive me
what happened yesterday evening ?
that 's something between UNknown and her
i think that UNknown will come back
i shouted that his father never would like to see him
hello my big little favourite !
do you think i may UNknown in ?
i didn 't say that
they sat on the lawn
thank you for the food
i 'm just thinking of UNknown
have you been with him on your island ?
UNknown is my half brother
but i think it 's best if you leave now
where have you been ?
UNknown where have you been ?
when mom told that they were getting married
i said that i didn 't want to participate on the wedding
then she was sorry and then angry and told me that i 'm always nasty
then i said that i didn 't want to live with her and johan
do you know what she did then ?
'd on 't you get it child that you will never see your real father
i have lots of huts out in the woods
i saw you when you searched today
how long will you be gone ?
a week until they miss me properly
but it 's so damn cold
i have done something wrong
i called mom a moment ago and said
that your mom had locked herself in a refuse container
why did you do that ?
i wanted mom to become worried but no afterwards i
where is the container you bitch ?
i 'm no longer afraid of you !
just tell me where the container is !
can you stop thinking about yourselves a couple of seconds ?
alice has something to tell us
UNknown was in my room just now but he went out in the woods again
he is very afraid of you all of you
i won 't do it !
i will not go back to school until patrick is back
lotta of course she is worried
it 's my family too !
your family is here alice
and dad and anna will get married
UNknown is my UNknown brother
what are you doing ?
you are so mean !
how much more will he destroy things for us ?
in the nights in school at work !
damn i UNknown l be too late !
you can 't chase a child back home !
but what shall i do then ?
he has fallen in !
what shall we do ?
but he can swim can 't he ?
but it 's ice cold in the water !
do you want him to die or what ?
run back home call dad and anna
what will you do ?
i know that his dad doesn 't want to hear of him
so it may be rather good for him even though he doesn 't feel that way
that my dad can join in as extra dad to him
because he has never had any dad
you agree well with UNknown
we do have similar UNknown about things
we both want things as they were before
but we are not best friends
we are half brother and half sister

or did you see yourself in a different role ?
well yes i did !
with my qualifications i saw myself in the capacity of a financial adviser !
bonjour UNknown you are beautiful you are rodney !
and having paid the 200 pounds my financial adviser then advised me to chuck the bleedin lot in the river !
now with financial UNknown like that who needs a bleeding UNknown !
what kind of financial adviser goes out to buy an emperor burger and comes back with a UNknown ?
will you stop going on about that ruddy UNknown !

it 's against the law to force feed a senior citizen with a UNknown and you know he hates UNknown m !!
well what did you buy it for him for ?
it 's all i could afford !!
you make my life a misery you do
here oi just a moment !
what was the last remark about me making your life a misery ?
yeah well you do del with your over bearing over protective manner !
let me remind you rodney that you were a six year old little UNknown when god smiled on mum and made her die !
two months after that dad packed his bags and left us to fend for ourselves
it was me that kept us together nothing to do with grandad !
all you ever gave me was tv dinners and convenience foods !
if it wasn 't frozen or UNknown we didn 't eat it
if you had been in charge of the last supper it would have been a take away !
well anything was better than the UNknown and chips that grandad used to knock up !
del look don 't get me wrong im i 'm grateful
i don 't want your gratitude ungrateful little git !
i don 't know what is the matter with you rodney
sometimes i hesitate to tell people that you 'r e my brother !
well i always say i 'm your social worker !
do you mind telling me exactly what it is that has made your life a misery ?
well you UNknown e always treated me like a child !
i was the only sixth former in my UNknown school who wore short trousers !
yeah well i got UNknown m cheap didn 't i ?
but i was 15 del
i was growing hairs and things !
my legs looked like italian UNknown !
and you 'd never let me do anything on my own would you ?
you even had to help me with my UNknown studies !
you passed in two subjects
i failed in the other eight del
i mean you embarrass me that 's why i never bring women home !
oh you know some women do you ?
cor that 's a turn up for the book !
the only bird i UNknown e ever heard you mention was old shanghai lil from the art college in UNknown
even then you had to drug her before you could get your leg over !
what you didn 't drug her or didn 't get your leg over ?
you 'r e suffocating me del !
i 'm getting out of this house !
i 'm going to prove to you i can survive on my own !
i 'm going to the pub !
what to prove you can survive on your own ?
no to get UNknown !
i don 't need you no more del i don 't need you for nothing !!
i was just i was just wondering
i think he 's very much like you grandad !
what dignified in defeat ?
no no i 'm sure these can 't be the ones they 'r e looking for
no no i wouldn 't do that to a mate now would i eh ?
no don 't you say nothing to UNknown m you wally !
i mean you can 't trust the old bill can you !
i mean look at that time when they planted six gas UNknown in my bedroom !
yeah alright don 't worry okay
where was you first thing this morning ?
i was out tryin to sell these things
did you call rodney ?
no i thought i 'd let him lie in and sleep his hangover off
is he still in bed ?
packed his UNknown sack and had it away on his toes !
what do you mean gone ?
i know where hong kong is !
what i want to know is what 's rodney doing there ?
but she 's in UNknown so what 's master mind doing on the road to hong kong ?
no that 's where she is now
she got deported after the drugs trial
what did you do say or cook for him that was so awful it forced him to leave ?
it was that row last night
he 's gone to prove himself
prove himself no it 's just one of rodney 's little games that 's all
he 'd never reach hong kong
he has trouble finding UNknown
well didn 't you do anything ?
well yeah i made him some sandwiches
and he took them ?
blimey this is worse than i thought !
no wait a minute he ain 't got no money !
he took his post office book with him
can 't you go and search for him ?
he 's been gone about seven hours the UNknown he could have got is france
oh that 's alright we UNknown e got him cornered then ain 't we eh !
i 'd get more joy out of UNknown
but he might be in danger
you could explain to them what rodney 's like
i 'm sorry i don 't know the french for UNknown !
i mean hong kong !
why didn 't he tell me where he was going
this thing still ain 't working properly
that 's because you 'r e playing UNknown on it
it 's a talking chess game you can 't play UNknown on a talking chess game
because you 'r e supposed to play chess on it that 's why it 's called a talking chess game
you UNknown e already blown the UNknown chip twice trying to UNknown the rook and what 'a ve yer !
but i can 't play chess !
why don 't they invent a talking UNknown game ?
because if they did you 'd most probably want to play bloody UNknown on it
rodney 's back del look he 's here
i haven 't eaten for two days
shall i cook you something ?
no no no no !!
a cup of tea perhaps !
old place don 't change much
no same as ever !
it 's really good to be back del !
don 't you think you 'r e over doing the prodigal 's return a bit
you UNknown e only been gone six days
well it might seem like six days to you del but to me it seemed like more
i take it you didn 't reach hong kong !
how far d UNknown ou get ?
south of france st UNknown
i met one english girl there veronica her father 's a millionaire tax exile
tax exile is he ? illegal move

a yacht anchored off shore
they invited me over for dinner one night !
i didn 't go though
still had some of grandad 's sandwiches left did ya ?
no that night i packed my bags and headed home
i was homesick you see i missed that !
the only people who ever missed that was the ruddy luftwaffe !
it may not be much to you del but to me it 's got a raw and savage beauty
you forget that i UNknown e got artist 's eyes del
yes you UNknown e got pianist 's fingers italian UNknown 's legs

i know you UNknown l never understand what i mean del but you UNknown e got to suffer paradise before you can realise what you left behind
your passport my passport !!
you knew didn 't you ?
you let me go through all that and all the time you knew !
where did you find it ?
top of your wardrobe !
we were expecting a visit from the local gendarmes and i thought i 'd better check out just in case you 'd left any of that exotic tobacco lying about
no i knew it was just a moody rodney
i told grandad it was just one of rodney 's little games
it gets a bit embarrassing at times
i UNknown l tell you another thing shall i rodney ?
you said that i would never get rid of them UNknown !
and you did didn 't you del ?
you threw UNknown m all in the river ?

you 'r e going on a trip ?
paradise falls a land lost in time

did you know that the UNknown forms when warm air rises over cool air ?
stayed up all night blowing up balloons for what ? and that 's how we get lightning
there 's a storm coming
it 's starting to get scary
we 'r e gonna get blown to bits !
we 'r e in big trouble
i thought you were dead

ellie it 's so beautiful
i UNknown l climb up
now when you get up there go ahead and hoist me up !
hey if i could assist you over there would you sign off on my badge ?
what are you talking about ?
we could walk your house to the falls
after all we weigh it down
we could walk it right over there
now we 'r e gonna walk to the falls quickly and quietly
we have three days at best before the UNknown leaks out of those balloons
and if we 'r e not at the falls when that happens
sand we 'r e not getting to the falls
don 't you worry ellie
we UNknown l get our house over there
this is fun already isn 't it ?
by the time we get there you 'r e gonna feel so assisted
oh mr UNknown if we happen to get separated use the wilderness explorer call
why are we going to paradise falls again ?
hey let 's play a game
my mom loves that game !
would you hurry it up ?
my elbow hurts and i have to go to the bathroom
i asked you about that five minutes ago
well i didn 't have to go then !
i don 't wanna walk anymore
russell if you don 't hurry up the tigers will eat you
oh for the love of pete !
i UNknown e always wanted to try this
mr UNknown am i supposed to dig the hole before or after ?
don 't be afraid little UNknown
i am a wilderness explorer so i 'm a friend to all of nature
don 't eat it all
oh yes they 'r e very tall
do they have a lot of colors ?
do they like chocolate ?
what is that thing ?
it 's a UNknown !
there 's no such thing as a UNknown !
get out of here !
get out of here !
that 's his name i just gave him
get out of here !
i UNknown l get the food for him
i UNknown l walk him
an explorer is a friend to all be it plants or fish or tiny mole
that doesn 't even rhyme
you 'r e not allowed up there !
she said for you to let me
but i told him no
i see you back there
go annoy someone else for a while
it 's nice to know someone else is up here
you can smell us ?
you were talking to a rock
hey that one looks like a turtle
look at that one !
that one looks like a dog
we 'r e not allowed to have dogs in my apartment
i have just met you and i love you
my master made me this collar
my master is good and smart
what do these do boy ?
i use that collar to talk with
i would be happy if you stopped
russell don 't touch that !
it could be radioactive or something !
i am a great UNknown
my pack sent me on a special mission all by myself
have you seen a bird ?
i want to find one and i UNknown e been on the scent
i am a great UNknown
did i mention that ?
hey that is the bird
i have never seen one up close but this is the bird
may i take your bird back to camp as my prisoner ?
and on the way learn how to bark like a real dog
can we keep him ?
but it 's a talking dog !
it 's just a weird trick or something
let 's get to the falls
i picked up the bird 's scent !
wait a minute wait a minute !
i 'm getting UNknown and UNknown cream !
oh man master will not be pleased
we better tell him someone took the bird
soon enough the bird will be ours yet again
find the scent my UNknown and you too shall have much UNknown from master for the toil factor you wage
hey alpha i think there 's something wrong with your collar
you must UNknown e bumped it
UNknown you desire to challenge the ranking that i have been assigned by my strength and cunning
i wonder if he 's found the bird on his very special mission
do not mention dug to me at this time
his fool 's errand will keep him most occupied
do you not agree with that which i am saying to you now ?
sure but the second master finds out you sent dug out by himself none of us will get a treat
you are wise my trusted lieutenant
this is alpha calling dug
hey your voice sounds funny
i know i know !
the bird is my prisoner now
hey dug who you talking to ?
what 's dug doing ?
why 's he with that small mailman ?
oh please oh please oh please be my prisoner
dug stop bothering kevin !
that man there says i can take the bird and i love that man there like he is my master
i am not your master !
i am jumping on you now bird
i am nobody 's master got it ?
i don 't want you here and i don 't want you here !
i 'm stuck with you !
and if you two don 't clear out of here by the time i count to three
oh boy oh boy !
i do ever so want the ball
what are we doing ?
hey we 'r e pretty far now
kevin 's gonna miss me
well thanks for keeping us dry anyway ellie
aren 't you super wilderness guy with the UNknown and the badges ?
i never actually built a tent before
you UNknown e been camping before haven 't you ?
well why didn 't you ask your dad how to build a tent ?
i don 't think he wants to talk about this stuff
well why don 't you try him sometime
maybe he UNknown l surprise you
well he 's away a lot
i don 't see him much
he 's gotta be home sometime
you call your own mother by her first name ?
but he promised he 'd come to my explorer ceremony to pin on my assisting the elderly badge
so he can show me about tents then right ?
hey why don 't you get some sleep ?
don 't wanna wake up the traveling flea circus
dug says he wants to take kevin prisoner
we have to protect him
can kevin go with us ?
all right he can come
maybe russell won 't notice
all right everybody up !
that 's my food !
get off my roof !
yeah get off of his
what is it doing ?
kevin 's a girl ?
her house is over there in those UNknown rocks
kevin 's just leaving ?
but you promised to protect her
this was her favorite chocolate
where 's the bird ?
since i have said that i can see how you would think that
why do i not have a surprised feeling ?
well at least you now have led us to the small mailman and the one who smells of UNknown
we 'r e not going with you !
we 'r e going to the falls !
get away from me !
that is the darnedest thing i UNknown e ever seen
you 'r e not after my bird are you ?
but if you needed to borrow a cup of sugar
i 'd be happy to oblige
well this is all a misunderstanding
are you charles UNknown ?
adventure is out there !
it 's really him !
that 's charles UNknown !
you 'r e a man of good taste
these people are no longer intruders !
i will not bite you
the small mailman smells like chocolate
i 'm sorry about the dogs
hope they weren 't too rough on you
go ahead and moor your UNknown right next to mine
would you like to ?
what do we do with dug ?
he has lost the bird
put him in the cone of shame
i do not like the cone of shame
well most of the collection is UNknown in the world 's top museums
of course i kept the best for myself
will you look at that ?
beast charged while i was brushing my teeth
only way to get it out of ethiopia at the time was to have it declared as dental equipment
the giant UNknown leopard tortoise !
i found it on safari with roosevelt
he and i fell into a habit of playing gin rummy in the evenings and did he cheat !
it 's that loose wire again
there you go big fella
i liked his other voice
so how are things stateside huh ?
i hope you 'r e hungry because UNknown is the finest chef i UNknown e ever had
oh my ellie would UNknown e loved all this
you know it 's because of you she had this dream to come down here and live by paradise falls
and now you UNknown e made it
you 'r e sure we 'r e not a bother ?
i want a treat !
i shouldn 't have used that word
having guests is a delight
they called me a fraud those
but once i bring back this creature my name will be cleared
beautiful isn 't it ?
i UNknown e spent a lifetime tracking it
sometimes years go by between UNknown
i UNknown e tried to smoke it out of that UNknown labyrinth where it lives
you can 't go in after it
once in there 's no way out
i UNknown e lost so many dogs
and here they come these bandits and think the bird is theirs to take
but they soon find that this mountain is a very dangerous place
yeah that 's my new giant bird pet
i trained it to follow us
i gave her some of my chocolate
she goes UNknown for it
you know carl these people who pass through here they all tell pretty good stories
a surveyor making a map
an old man taking his house to paradise falls
i mean that 's the best one yet
i can 't wait to hear how it ends
well it 's been a wonderful evening but we better be going
oh you 'r e not leaving
we don 't want to take advantage of your hospitality
but we haven 't even had dessert yet
you haven 't had dessert
UNknown here makes a delicious cherries jubilee
they 'r e coming !
i will stop the dogs !
give me your hand !
she 's hurt real bad
can 't we help her get home ?
all right but we gotta hurry
my pack is not following us
i finally meet my childhood hero and he 's trying to kill us
hey i know a joke
a squirrel walks up to a tree and says
you know what mr UNknown ?
it 's kind of wild
i mean it 's not how they made it sound in my book
get used to that kid
my dad made it sound so easy
he 's really good at camping and how to make fire from rocks and stuff
he used to come to all my sweat lodge meetings
and afterwards we 'd go get ice cream at UNknown
look at that bird go
wait up you overgrown chicken
go find your babies !
russell give me your knife !
we UNknown l want her in good shape for my return
you just gave her away
this is none of my concern
i didn 't ask for any of this !
i am not your master !
and if you hadn 't have shown up none of this would UNknown e happened !
now whether you assist me or not
i 'm gonna help kevin even if you won 't !
i was hiding under your porch because i love you
well you 'r e my dog aren 't you ?
and i 'm your master
you 'r e my master ?
and they wouldn 't believe me
where 's your elderly friend ?
he 's not my friend anymore
well if you 'r e here UNknown can 't be far behind
where are you keeping kevin ?
scream all you want small mailman
none of your mailman friends can hear you
i UNknown l unleash all my wilderness explorer training !
alpha UNknown 's coming back
if you see the old man you know what to do
hey where are you going ?
i 'm not finished with you !
dug bring her over !
you came back for kevin !
let 's go get her !
i don 't want your help
we 'r e on our way
allow no one to be entering through these doors
guard well that bird my UNknown
what do we do now dug ?
i want the ball !
give it to me !
then go get it !
i 'm gonna get there first !
he 's got the bird !
one at a time !
i want to help !
he 's in hall d !
he 's in hall c !
it 's the old man !
does anyone know where they are ?
any last words UNknown ?
i am taking that bird back with me
i will have many UNknown from what i am about to do dug
get this off of me !
you leave mr UNknown alone !
where 's the squirrel ?
russell hang on to kevin !
oh i am ready to not be up high
sorry about your house mr UNknown
you know it 's just a house
i wish i could keep one
where 's my cane ?
i just had it here
a little gift from me to you
and by receiving their badges the following explorers will graduate to senior explorers
russell for assisting the elderly and for performing above and beyond the call of duty
i would like to award you the highest honor i can bestow
all right i think that covers everybody
so let 's give a big explorer call to our brand new senior wilderness explorers
it 's red isn 't it ?
mr UNknown you 'r e cheating
that 's a fire UNknown
maybe i need new glasses
adventure is out there it 's heading our way
so grab your scarf and goggles let 's fly
i UNknown e UNknown out our journey we 'r e up here to stay
a sunset is our home a UNknown we will own
my spirit of adventure is you
freaks of nature span a globe that 's too big to deny
with UNknown guards we UNknown l travel there and spit into their eye

but you know what ?
you 'r e not gonna waste anymore of my time
you piece of shit !
the strange preliminary were approved in the street and pouring out of the offices in norway
according to the worker 's strike for the magistrate this is the first time in a few decades
that the moment the ship were freed of sight
everybody wants to know where they 'r e going to
there 's no way of knowing where they want us to join in return
we don 't know if they 'r e simply escaping whether he will affect the rescue plan
and as the so called UNknown says whether alien will declare war on us
this is the most known UNknown in this murder
and we can only speculate as what has happened to him
the UNknown UNknown there is state that he 's been captured by by alien or by another government
or by absolute UNknown government agency and is actually being held in captivity
we 'r e trying to help him
and then that is the most difficult part is just not knowing where he is
because sadly he 's gone but i 'm the one who stays behind of all UNknown
i can 't give up
he died in my mind a long time ago
peter UNknown is is a name that would become very very widely known because of this fugitive role that he played in this monument
he was an honest man and he didn 't deserve any of what happened to him
i mean i know i look into the computer system and i found stuff
i mean the whole document is there
they didn 't even do a good job of hiding it
you guys haven 't seen it or what ?
let me show you what i have
she looks like an angel
you want to see that ?
don 't you see ?
with the white UNknown and looks like an angel
you wanna see his daddy 's wife who 's an angel but this is a real ideal angel on the cameras
they work with that in the movie
i found this at my front door
looks like somebody just left it there
my friend said she just throw away what 's from the ship
it couldn 't probably come from him
gina morris and i are gonna leave for UNknown right after school today
honey i completely forgot about that
can you do it next weekend ?
it 's already 7 00 ?
what 's up ms b ?
dude she totally threw off my groove !
what 's up man ?
what 's up little people ?
can i ask you a question ?
so let me get this straight
and i 'm no expert but doesn 't that seem a little
kind of g a y ?
dude i think you 'r e kind of missing the point
satan 's children i swear
all right see you guys !
would you look at this guy ?
hey morris what 's up with all the geek books ?
i UNknown e got a scholarship interview in a day carter
and my parents are up my ass about it
morris your parents are always up your ass
besides don 't you want to go to some fancy UNknown ivy league school ?
do we really have to start this early ?
well apparently it 's not my choice carter
at least kevin will be there
yeah the technique was a little off but the timing was better
and by the way she 's easy but not in the like i 'm gonna fuck morris kind of way easy
come on UNknown i UNknown e got to pee
there 's no reason for him to come
you know what morris ?
i think for the first time you and i are on the same page
campus tours and scholarship interviews sounds like a real UNknown blast
but i think i 'd rather sock myself in the nuts
i mean seriously look at this thing
like where are all the UNknown you know ?
listen don 't take this the wrong way
you kids have fun !
i got my high five dude
here 's your UNknown though
when did you apply there ?
i mean what about our plans to go to UNknown together ?
and the campus tour this weekend ?
look it 's senior year
it 's like so exciting and i wanna party and i wanna have fun
and you 'r e like not fun
so i don 't drink very much you know
like our friday nights at UNknown golf
yeah they 'r e kind of boring
our camping trips the school carnival studying together ?
when we were UNknown it was one thing
but this is our time to really go crazy !
we 'r e supposed to be UNknown
and you you 'r e just
you 'r e a loser !
college is just around the corner and i can 't let you ruin my senior year
dude have you been listening to me ?
morris you 'r e such a fucking liar dude
you UNknown e never even had a girlfriend
we went to physics camp together
maybe more like fantasy camp
i 'm having a breakdown here
what am i supposed to do now ?
first we 'd go to college together and then we 'd get married have a couple kids one girl one boy
no wonder she dumped your ass
you 'r e fucking lame
what 's up fellows ?
what 's up fletcher ?
what 's up with negative nancy over here ?
so are you guys going on some sort of road trip to UNknown this weekend ?
i don 't think i 'm going anymore
i just went there last weekend to visit my bro
i almost didn 't make it back
almost didn 't make it back ?
dude it 's just college
yeah see that 's what i thought too
and then i went and i 'm telling you guys right now it is fucking nuts man
you guys want to know ?
basically this is how it went down
i didn 't sleep for three days okay ?
i don 't have any money left in my bank account
i UNknown out my parents credit card which was only supposed to be used in case of an emergency
i lost my cell phone which is actually my dad 's cell phone
so he 's pissed about that and the credit card
i tried smoking a UNknown which i thought was a big fat joint
stole a car got in a bar fight ate some goldfish
played naked frisbee did some whip its wet my brother 's bed twice
shit my pants once but please don 't tell anyone cause i 'm kind of embarrassed about that
saw two girls make out
watched my brother 's UNknown eat as many UNknown as they could until one of them UNknown
found a tattoo on my lower back of a UNknown
don 't remember getting that
figure i UNknown l just tell people it 's some sort of killer UNknown
who knows if he 's even telling the truth ?
what if he was ?
all the UNknown the UNknown the sex the drinking it sounds incredible
you know maybe i UNknown l even get a tattoo
wait you 'r e joking right ?
that 's a good one
i 'm not kidding morris
you know maybe gina 's right i 'm no fun
a weekend like fletcher 's is exactly what i need
UNknown having some crazy weekend to get back at gina is a really bad idea
i 'm gonna go for it
dude this is definitely better than the UNknown !
yeah man i UNknown e got a good feeling about this
what kind of good feeling ?
like your boy carter 's gonna get laid kind of feeling ?
cause i have that feeling too and i love it !
i don 't know man just everything
i 'm ready to have fun
okay UNknown it says here that the campus tour is at 12 30 tomorrow afternoon
and there 's a UNknown UNknown reception tonight before dinner in the main
okay that 's enough !
that 's our schedule for the weekend !
dude morris fuck UNknown man !
we 'r e in college now
you know what that means ?
it does not get any better than this !
dude slow down slow down
hey what 's up ladies ?
what college are you visiting from ?
no no see we 'r e not in college
we 'r e actually still in high school
i hate you so much !
you 'r e crushing my UNknown !
what my friend meant to say was
i UNknown l see you guys later
hey green shirt if i give you 5 right now would you fart in a can and let me just keep it in my bedroom ?
why do we have to stay here ?
you don 't have to carter
this is where the UNknown board put me and kevin
look i got a cousin who 's a legacy in one of the UNknown
i 'm sure if we go there they UNknown l hook us up
i 'm kevin kevin brewer prospective freshman
look fellows i 'm gonna need about 20 30 minutes to finish up here okay ?
so just come back later
how 's that UNknown house sound guys ?
okay dude do you actually know where you 'r e going ?
it 's right up here i think
all right dude i 'm not perfect all right ?
all these greek letters look the same to me
maybe we should go back and try the dorm again
you shut your mouth !
chicks are smoking hot ?
all you got out was your name
i guess he 's taking that whole singing thing pretty seriously
looks like we got another semester without any UNknown
this fucking blows man !
yeah i didn 't think it 'd come so soon
i 'm scared to graduate
it seems like torturing UNknown that 's all i 'm good at
that 's not true and you know that
you 'r e good at a lot of things
nobody beats you at that
it 's like a real gift
i feel a lot better
hang in there big guy
you 'r e all right
we UNknown l figure this whole pledge thing out i promise
you can 't read greek ?
what 's a UNknown ?
it 's his pledge name
who 'd want that name ?
wait wait wait wait !
look we 'r e in high school you know ?
we 'r e just up here to party you know ?
is that too much to ask ?
you guys are a bunch of high school kids ?
i can 't believe they call toby UNknown
what did those guys want ?
a couple of high school kids looking to crash here for the weekend
one of them was UNknown 's cousin
god that guy could toss a salad
that guy 's a loser
so they 'r e looking for a place to crash huh ?
maybe we should let them stay
what are you serious ?
what 's your names ?
these guys are our guests for the weekend
well see technically we 'r e supposed to stay in the UNknown but our roommate 's a little
technically you 'r e a fag ! preoccupied
he 's got anger management issues
how about i show you guys where you are staying ?
put your stuff away ?
what 's up shit face ?
this is usually where we let our UNknown stay
we call this room the dungeon but don 't let the name scare you
you 'r e gonna love it
yeah this place fucking sucks
dude it beats some guy jerking all right ?
we feel really bad about having to put you guys down here
is that a rat ?
and don 't you guys worry
we 'r e gonna give you the 411 on all the great parties this weekend
what the fuck is up with that
that 's so fucking gross
we 'r e here to learn about college right ?
god i love the new attitude kevin
it looks good on you man
it makes your eyes pop and your hair shine
hold onto your socks because this is going to be awesome
it 's a total sausage UNknown
these guys are so drunk they 'r e making out with each other
morris i don 't think they 'r e drunk
who wants to play glow in the dark UNknown now ?
it 's UNknown tag !
it 's UNknown tag !
why would they send us to an all gay fraternity ?
do we look gay ?
maybe they found out how many times you UNknown e been laid and just assumed
look my cousin 's a legacy
i doubt they 'r e gonna do that to us on purpose
that was not full of my piss or anything
hey how was the party ?
did you guys find any dates ?
we almost got jumped back there
watch your step UNknown UNknown !
this ain 't high school !
god bless america for such a place !
what 's up fellows ?
it was just a joke
we weren 't trying to be like assholes or anything
let us make it up to you
we 'r e gonna go do some body shots
and we would love it if you guys would come with us
dude we are so down !
actually you know what ?
i just filled up so i 'm cool
yeah i think i 'm gonna take a pass too
just saying man i guess gina was right
all right you know what ?
what the hell is that for ?
you guys are gonna love this
where did the girls go ?
unfortunately the girls had to go home early
so who are we doing body shots off of ?
that 's right motherfuckers !
where are you guys going ?
yeah we thought you guys were cool
we thought you wanted to party
well have fun back at the dorm you fucking UNknown
everything 's spinning around me
i 'm drunk right now
i don 't feel shit !
so when do i get a turn ?
i can 't play ?
what do you say we wrap up this game and bring it up to my room ?
i think i UNknown l pass
UNknown in the UNknown !
who wants a balloon ?
can i have one please ?
the lady needs a balloon
there you go darling that one 's just for you
this balloon 's for you !
you have to inhale it
hey i saw a laundry room back there
you want to go make out or something ?
you UNknown e got flat tits !
or down the whole thing
how 's it going ?
you 'r e bigger than me
i think someone 's coming
i 'm not gonna fit under there !
you UNknown l fit !
i will not fit under this bed
are you sure this room 's okay ?
i 'm just a little nervous you know ?
i UNknown e never really been with a girl before
morris maybe it 's because i 'm really high right now but i will just go for this
that feels so good !
your hands are like butter !
you know normally i 'd be doing this to myself but this is way better
what 's your problem ?
you carry that with you ?
they don 't call it a pocket rocket for nothing
i didn 't hear anything
what the fuck do you know about welfare reform ?
come on down and check it out
so i don 't really know what this means but amy says that she 's under the bed with your friend carter
why aren 't they on top of the bed ?
that 's a good question
i really suck but that 's cool
it 's supposed to be one of the best in the country
what 's up man ?
you know you 'r e different than most college guys
but it 's a good thing
give it to me again big boy !
what are you doing here ?
you missed your interview morris
apparently mr hooper 's a no show
you 'r e still here
i 'm sorry i 'm late
now behind me is the bronze statue of a revolutionary war hero
it has become one of the most sacred UNknown of our time
my parents are gonna disown me
dude they probably didn 't even notice
did you see my face ?
just kiss the scholarship bye bye and move on
and where the hell is kevin by the way ?
you know he should UNknown e been here by now
this is his campus tour
he probably just hooked up last night
you don 't think something happened to him do you ?
what could possibly happen to him ?
a lot UNknown than i thought you 'd be
yeah it 's not really the UNknown of my day either carter
why would they do this to you ?
because they can i guess
maybe we should just go home
what are you trying to prove ?
i 'm not trying to prove anything
i 'm just trying to have fun
god i love the new kevin !
you call this having a good time ?
i UNknown l get back at them
it could have been worse
dude maybe the message didn 't even send
well in that case let 's do like a whole kevin party series
we UNknown l post it online
being stuck here isn 't the worst thing
you know i mean it 's probably for the best
how 's it for the best ?
your parents would go ape shit on your ass for blowing the big interview
and now at least you could probably talk to that dean chandler guy
you know explain what happened
you really think that would work ?
i think it 's worth a shot
what do you have to lose ?
and you may see that heather chick again and get more than a half hand job
by the way i sort of accidentally told kendall we were in college last night
looks like those high school UNknown aren 't as stupid as we thought
it 's part of the whole UNknown experience
are any of them naked ?
all right bitches you 'r e up !
this isn 't social hour !
so i guess you better go huh ?
yeah but maybe if you 'r e lucky we UNknown l let you guys buy us a few beers tonight at bruno 's
i 'm always at the bar
just make sure you bring this guy
last night was the first UNknown party i actually enjoyed
well we UNknown l see you guys tonight then
just try not to pass out on me this time
what 's up fellows ?
heard you and the general got a little cozy last night
yeah that was a good one UNknown
hey i don 't suppose you know what happened to my car do you ?
so that 's how it 's gonna be UNknown ?
that 's right UNknown UNknown
in fact we got a job for you three UNknown bags
we 'r e just gonna need you to clean the house for our party tonight
you know how i like to keep my ride clean
where did i put them keys ?
am i UNknown some hostility ?
wait are you guys serious ?
well you guys didn 't think your room and board were gonna be free here did you ?
we 'r e not cleaning your house !
well maybe your little girlfriends over there would like to find out you guys are still in high school
how do you know we didn 't already tell them ?
because if you did they wouldn 't be giving you the time of day you little dicks
better get to work now boys !
don 't waste your time with kendall
you don 't want my sloppy seconds do you ?
unless you 'r e into that ?
dude why do we have to clean ?
don 't they got UNknown to do this shit ?
cause i UNknown e been cleaning all day so you think that it 'd be funny to come in and throw a cup down
because i UNknown e been working really hard and you want to ruin that for me
you 'r e so fucking cool you bitch
yeah get some you punk ass bitch !
come here you steaming fuck !
i don 't know if this is a good idea
you can do it !
i believe in you !
you 'r e the UNknown bro !
let 's just say that this morning was well rather shocking
heck i didn 't even know what some of those words meant
i had to search the internet for them
but i guess that 's what happens when you choose to stay at a UNknown house rather than the dorm room we assigned you
it was a bad choice
christ if i had my way i 'd kick every fraternity off this campus
that 's just awful !
mr hooper there is no doubt that you are UNknown gifted but the UNknown we give out here are about much more than just that
dean chandler that 's me
my family has a long history at UNknown and i 'd like to continue that legacy
well you know son i guess you 'r e gonna have to prove it to me
you 'r e so lame !
dude where have you been ?
i just had to run a little errand
all my years of hard work have finally paid off !
what 's wrong morris ?
i 'm having a breakdown kevin !
or have you forgotten what that feels like ?
what am i gonna do ?
somehow i have to convince the dean that i actually want to go here
well look there 's nothing you can do about it tonight all right ?
just tell the bouncer you don 't photograph well
dude this will totally work !
you guys are both just so ugly
you 'r e a little UNknown but it UNknown l be good
man you actually expect me to buy that your name is UNknown ?
yeah you big big man
you like that when i squeeze them together for you ?
i cannot believe those assholes ripped us off
they UNknown e done pretty much everything else to us so far this weekend
man do you think this is what it 's going to be like
when we 'r e really in college ?
well we probably won 't all be together
god morris you 'r e such a fucking baby !
would you stop being a girl ?
you know all the more of a reason to take advantage of being here
all right i 'm not sitting around
come on you guys !
where are you going ?
what do you think ?
we UNknown e got a UNknown party to go to
you 'r e so slow !
you guys ready to celebrate ?
where 's my whip ?
you want to be my bitch huh ?
fellows it 's not polite to stare !
what the fuck man ?
good for you for staying current
these guys were nice enough to pay for all this
that 's what you did with our money ?
you paid for this party ?
hey kegs aren 't cheap these days my man
you couldn 't have paid for this
what 's up with that ?
luckily you guys had some plastic
god my parents gave me that in case of an emergency
well good thing they got such a high limit !
we almost UNknown those puppies out
it was UNknown 's idea
god i love that guy
anyhow we UNknown e gotta go be social
that was so weird but so hot !
dude she grabbed my UNknown !
dude she twisted my UNknown dude !
in a roundabout way i guess it is
why don 't i like where this is going ?
i mean we paid for it
we may as well enjoy it
that 's my boy !
have you ever done one of these before ?
all right here make sure you get a good shot
wait i thought you didn 't want to send gina any more UNknown
i changed my mind all right ?
you don 't have to do this

you know now morris and carter are pissed at each other
they 'r e both pissed at me
yeah he kinda told me
he told the whole campus
why 'd you do it ?
i mean with a guy like UNknown ?
for all the wrong reasons
it was kind of why i UNknown out tonight
i found out that you lied and i assumed that you were just like UNknown
oh god please look i 'm nothing like that guy
i 'm really sorry about everything

or is this the new and improved college kevin talking ?
all right well i gotta go find carter and morris
i UNknown e been thinking all night
i just want to say i 'm sorry about everything
you said some harsh things man
i UNknown e realized a lot about myself this weekend and you guys

i UNknown e just been so hung up on what gina told me that i haven 't even stopped to think that you know maybe she was wrong
you guys are my best friends
sorry i like UNknown out and lost my shit

there 's a jew boy deputy d a
warrants was local celebrity as a cop
they want to see you upstairs
the d a s office
back then i told myself i didn 't care
bucky this is chief ted green
deputy district attorney ellis UNknown
read that out loud dwight
that 's running in the sunday times
before the war the city of angels
was UNknown with two local fighters
mr fire and mr ice never fought each other
but duty brought them to the los angeles police department
blanchard cracked the boulevard citizens bank robbery case in 1939
and captured thrill killer tomas dos santos
UNknown served with distinction during the UNknown suit wars
on election day voters are going to be asked to vote on a bond proposal
to UNknown the UNknown 's equipment

what do you say bucky ?
i was just telling kay here about our new hobby
are you a fight fan miss lake ?
no lee used to drag me
i was taking art classes so i 'd sketch
she made me quit fighting the UNknown
didn 't want me doing the vegetable shuffle
i promise not to hurt you
that won 't make UNknown very happy
oh he 's got money on me ?
you win you get warrants
what 's in it for you ?
well betting works both ways
my girl 's got a taste for nice things and i can 't afford to let her down
keep talking about me in third person
what do you think of all this miss lake ?
well for civic reasons i hope the UNknown is UNknown for UNknown this farce
for personal reasons i hope lee wins

i UNknown e done my homework
i 'm not betting on me pete
blanchard 's the hero here
that 's the way the story 's supposed to go
well at least he looks good with his shirt off
where 's your UNknown ?
i was never any good
ended up with a master 's in history
education 's an expensive habit
he shouldn 't have quit fighting
besides police work gives him a sense of order
do you have a girlfriend dwight ?
so he quits fighting for you puts you through school
why aren 't you married ?
you know UNknown 's against UNknown
probably cost him a stripe
so where 's the diamonds and the UNknown huh ?
the gym was packed to the rafters
a wild crowd hungry to see what was in us
i already knew what was in us
i was trading warrants for a close out on old bad debts
the eight grand i was going to clear was enough to maintain the old man in a good clean rest home for three years
you 'r e out !

a toast to proposition b
to the UNknown blanchard UNknown bigger than louis UNknown
from november through the new year
after tours of duty lee and i would go to the house and find kay

other times the three of us would go out on the town
UNknown rape armed robbery felony UNknown
mr nash pistol whipped a little old lady at a stickup near UNknown park tuesday morning
junior nash was an UNknown UNknown shit UNknown who came west and took all us locals for easy marks just because we prefer our cowboys to look like gene UNknown
of course i didn 't care if he was a hard man or what he thought about anything
he raped children and beat senior citizens to death
he was a coward and i wanted to put him down
i got a tip for the UNknown who 's going to be at norton and coliseum tonight
we 'r e going !
baby he 's gonna cut us a real good deal on this
i have been knowing him for a long time
you ain 't got to worry about a thing okay ?
you ain 't got to worry
he 's going to take care of me real soon
and i mean real soon
i haven 't heard of a clean cop baxter
i just want to go home
same reason why you do this to me
you know why i do this to you
where is this guy ?
listen this is the last time
i was half asleep but lee had his boxer 's wits about him
he felt the blow coming
get your UNknown hands off me man
i ain 't done nothing !
yeah what do you call that shooting gallery back there ?
well that 's about it
thank you for your time detective and for the good police work
blanchard knew the white guy i guess
it 's a busy neighborhood
no reporters view the body
you photo men finish taking your pictures now
coroner 's men put a sheet on the body as soon as they are done
we set up a perimeter six feet back
any reporter crosses it arrest him
now gentlemen before this gets out of hand
let 's put the UNknown on something
with publicity you get confessions
with confessions you get UNknown liars and false leads
so we keep some things quiet
the ear to ear facial UNknown UNknown you keep this information to yourselves
not your wives not your girlfriends no other officers and i mean no
UNknown what the hell are you doing here ?
where the hell 's blanchard ?
nash might be renting a room in that building over there
i heard something on the radio about a shooting
hey raymond nash remember ?
we need to go check out that room
but he beat a woman to death
i don 't want to talk about it
lee baxter fitch just happened to be there ?
what do you know about it ?
he knew one of the guys so
dwight was it you or them ?
hey kay who 's bobby dewitt ?
i know he 's an old beef of lee 's
but he doesn 't want to talk about it and he gets out in a week
you know who he is ?
i UNknown l take care of it
who are these men who feed on others ?
what do they feel when they cut their names into somebody else 's life ?
it was the case that made lee 's career
he 'd never said a word about it and i 'd never asked
dewitt got 10 to life in san quentin
lee got kay or maybe it was the other way around
yeah priority for homicide division not us
nice white girl gets UNknown
got to show the voters they did the right thing passing the bond issue
it 's a plus buck
we don 't miss this
maybe she wasn 't such a nice girl
maybe that old lady that nash UNknown was somebody 's loving granny
maybe we let the bureau handle this and we get back to our job before nash UNknown somebody else
got any other UNknown ?
yeah maybe we UNknown e had enough headlines
with or without you buck
mr UNknown can you assure the public that you will find the murderer before he strikes again ?
you got us detached ?
i gave UNknown a memo saying nash blew our jurisdiction
are you fucking nuts ?
this is the main event
just give me another week with this girl
what 's your problem with this ?
on gross UNknown we have a female UNknown between 16 and 30
the cadaver is presented in two halves with UNknown level with the UNknown
through and through UNknown of both mouth corners
no visible UNknown on the neck
UNknown UNknown on the wing tips of the UNknown bones
a puncture wound here in the palm
investigation of upper half UNknown UNknown reveals no free flowing blood
UNknown stomach spleen liver all removed
is it all right to smoke doctor ?
lower half of cadaver reveals removal of all UNknown organs
what 's your best guess ?
well here 's what she wasn 't she wasn 't raped and she wasn 't pregnant
in terms of the UNknown UNknown the cause of death is either the mouth wound here or she was beaten to death with something like a baseball bat
what about her insides ?
i say then he drained the blood from the body and washed it clean probably in a bathtub
have you got a name yet ?
other than that she 's clean
four sisters parents divorced her father 's here in l a
oh and i hear he sold some old photos of her to the herald
i got an alibi just in case you think i did it

she came around last christmas bragging about getting her big break
guess after all those screen tests she finally got a part
but she had a tendency to
do you know the names of any of her boyfriends ?
i mean i don 't want to tell any tales out of school but i do remember them being up on hollywood boulevard speaking to this older woman
and she she was wearing a man 's suit and had a man 's short haircut
but it was just that once
miss UNknown are you saying they were talking to a UNknown ?
we 'r e not done yet

my family and i were in UNknown from sunday through thursday along with the servants
if you want UNknown call daddy but please be discreet

i don 't need your daddy 's money if that 's what you 'r e saying
you know it 's not what i 'm saying
my address is 482 south UNknown UNknown park
like a gentleman not like a cop
look ma 'a m you mind ?

an old friend stuffed him
he wanted to work in the UNknown
hollywood was a cow pasture but the silent UNknown were booming
georgie got work as a lighting man me building houses
georgie introduced me to mack UNknown
old mack knew how to squeeze a dollar dry
he had extras UNknown as laborers and vice versa
georgie and i used to drive them over to UNknown after 12 hours on a silent UNknown
then put in another six hours by UNknown
are you feeling well ?
would you like to contribute to the conversation ?
did you know mr UNknown that UNknown boulevard is named after me ?
but all he could manage was a dead end block in a red light district in lincoln heights
are you familiar with the neighborhood mr UNknown ?
yes well then you UNknown l know that mexican prostitutes expose themselves in windows
i hear many of them know mr
i will sing for my supper when mayor UNknown comes to dinner but not for madeleine 's male whores
he 's a common policeman
you kept your name out of the papers
your mother would love that
the kind who takes pills the doctor gives her so she doesn 't have to admit to being a UNknown
daddy bought rotten lumber and old movie sets from mack UNknown and built houses out of them
that 's how he really made his money
he 's got UNknown all over l a
his good friend georgie UNknown in a car crash while running daddy some errands

last summer i heard about a girl who looked like me
i left notes at a couple of places
your look alike wants to meet you things like that
that 's how i met her at laverne 's with lorna
why 'd you want to meet betty short anyway ?
i UNknown e worked hard to be loose

well it is 8 15 and he is not here and neither are his letters of apology
UNknown get out of my sight
try and be a police officer
we forgot about junior nash
here he is dead in the middle of a stickup
he was trash and a killer and i 'd been right from the beginning
i beat up a wall
losing the first UNknown blanchard fight got me local celebrity warrants and close to nine grand in cash
winning the UNknown got me a sprained wrist two UNknown knuckles and the rest of the day off
i picked up lorna UNknown yesterday
she had a copy of a stag film her and betty short playing les
and i checked the case file
i 'm withholding evidence for you
it 's a fair trade but it shakes me
are you sure there isn 't anything you haven 't told me about you and betty ?
betty and i made love once that one time last summer
bobby dewitt 's probably in l a by now
lee always said i 'd be safe
he had a little sister
why didn 't you tell me this before ?
he made me promise never to tell you
he thought it made him too easy to figure
well it sure explains some things
kay where 's lee ?
if you know you should tell me
kay bobby dewitt just got out
lee 's all hopped up on UNknown so what do you think is going to happen ?
UNknown friedman called a couple of hours ago

look i 'm just looking for a place to take a piss
man oh UNknown i ain 't seen blanchard since my fucking trial
yeah but he 's been on your mind
and you UNknown e been on his mind
i 'm thinking that you let the word out there knowing he 'd come down here
look maybe i UNknown my trap at trial
i don 't know what his version is
what 's your version ?
my men are instructed not to take any chances and you did have a gun
the guy with the choke rope
i assume dewitt brought him for muscle
no identification nothing left of his face after he hit the fountain
you understand why we must handle things like this huh ?
see what we got here ?
want to say something ?
stolen witness reports medical records autopsy photos
lee had turned his life inside out and my dad 's apartment into the black dahlia 's house of horrors
i confessed to the only priest i needed
how long have you known about this ?

did you tell kay ?
well that 's as far as it goes then
our boy doesn 't need any more headlines
i want you to stick with me here
you UNknown e got tears running down your face

you must have a lot of fun
you look like you have a hell of a lot of fun
i 'm a fun UNknown gal
you got any special guys that you you know
yeah i met him in florida
and it was one of those things that was
gosh i don 't know if you UNknown e experienced this before but it was love at first sight
that 's what it was
he asked me to marry him that night
and then the next day he was just gone
well that ask you to marry him always works
no he promised he 'd come back
he was an air force captain which is why he had to leave
and you know what he used to do ?
he used to write me such beautiful UNknown romantic love letters
so what happened to prince charming ?
well the night that he was supposed to come back he was called to do one last mission and his plane crashed over india
and now he 's dead
boy you sure know how to tell a funny story
i 'm UNknown the ka UNknown sheets for tomorrow
i 'm going to kay 's
wednesday nights were the nights she 'd make lee and me a big dinner so
we haven 't done it since
we 'r e going to try
should we say something ?
we haven 't said anything
i feel like i haven 't said anything right
haven 't done anything right
i could UNknown e saved him
i could UNknown e saved him
i cut my foot on a bathroom tile
you got it in you to replace a few ?
i 'd always wondered where he kept it
were you ever going to tell me ?
he 'd given all his money to ben UNknown and he
he wanted to buy us a home
i didn 't know there was any left
were you ever going to tell me ?
bobby did do the bank job dwight
don 't get the wrong idea
i don 't know what kind of idea i got right now
things were getting really bad between me and bobby and i had to get out
i knew this guy that bobby made me be with once
he was a UNknown who let it slip that he sometimes UNknown to the cops for dope money
and then last year the guy
lee had given him 1 000 for introducing us
he found out that bobby was getting out and he threatened to tell him that we stole from him
he wanted money that we didn 't have dwight
what were we going to do ?
promise me promise me you UNknown l forgive him for dewitt
it doesn 't matter to us
what was the guy 's name ?
kay tell me the guy 's name
baxter fitch and then dewitt
you 'r e so good at some things
he loved both of us dwight so much
the basic rule of homicide applied
the UNknown of a fairy tale only a band aid to cover a fractured life
i didn 't believe in fairy tales
an old friend stuffed him
i just never imagined georgie so
daddy paid to have him buried at the family plot in scotland
i don 't get modern art
i doubt modern art gets you either
kay what the hell are you doing here ?
what am i doing here ?
you follow me here after what you UNknown e done ?
you lied to me !
i lied for you !
i lied for us !
what could i do but lie dwight ?
you could have told me the truth
she looks like that dead girl !
how sick are you ?
she looks like that dead girl !
how sick are you ?
the set was enough to tie UNknown to the UNknown movie but not to the murder
georgie introduced me to mack UNknown
one of my UNknown said the goddamn pipes are UNknown gas
there UNknown l be hell to pay
it 's about time i showed the three of you good old scotland
i don 't want to go to europe daddy
you 'r e always talking about how dreadful and provincial it is
yeah but it 's got what you need lassie
what is that emmett ?
you killed elizabeth short and the two of you covered it up
you made that stag film with lorna and betty
i UNknown e seen the set
put that gun down laddie
you might be half right
let 's talk the man who laughs
i UNknown e seen the movie
i UNknown e got you
so you don 't like my taste in art
georgie was always sneaking around daddy 's properties
betty called short of cash as usual
i put daddy on and he offered her money to date a nice man he knew
you must UNknown e known he was a sick fuck then
i mean he liked to touch dead things
i mean his father was a surgeon
did you know that ?
you did him enough damage emmett
now you let him go !
i would appreciate it if you just stopped shooting things officer though
the rich don 't own art just for themselves
we safe keep it for future generations
how did emmett damage georgie ?
what did he do to make him go so crazy ?
who made what made who crazy ?
not that emmett cared about that
but he was her father
and for that he ruined george 's face
when he got out of hospital
i gave him the hugo book as a present
he had worked construction on that movie with emmett
it was always one of his favorites
what about betty short ?
well that was the UNknown joke of all
and your husband bought her for georgie
he 's a shy wee lad but i
it was the second swing woke her up
she looked so like my UNknown
we UNknown l ruin you in court
it was neat enough for the papers but that didn 't make it clean
i guess they get to die differently too
did you come to pay your respects or fuck my sister ?
i came to talk to you about lee blanchard
he came here didn 't he ?
adios yourself back to the halls of tripoli UNknown
lee knew everything about you and elizabeth short
he knew everything didn 't he ?
i don 't know what you 'r e saying
i went by your house today
i talked to your sister martha
she told me that a policeman named lee blanchard came by the house asking questions about you and elizabeth short
she told him that the two of you were close
martha was always jealous of me
i beat up a wall
on the night that he went to the olympic to settle an old score you tracked him there
i UNknown e been pointing my gun at a lot of people this week
i haven 't had a chance to shoot anybody yet
what do you think ?
i think you 'd rather fuck me than kill me but you don 't have the guts to do either
you 'r e a boxer not a fighter
you 'r e a murderer
you should thank me for lee blanchard
if it weren 't for me you wouldn 't have had the balls to fuck your partner 's girl
you don 't fuck her anymore
because you 'd rather fuck me
you don 't talk about them
you chose me over her
you UNknown l choose me over him
he was going to take daddy 's money and leave
you 'd never shoot me
don 't forget who i look like
ones i 'd loved and ones who 'd loved me
people i 'd betrayed and people i needed to protect
and for the first time in my life
i had people that knew that for the UNknown of times in the darkest of places
for everything people were making it out to be you 'd think it was our first fight
and it wouldn 't be our last
hey UNknown on the private chasing that skinny one over there !

i already knew him by reputation record down pat
light heavy 36 0 0

my first 20 fights were UNknown UNknown by my manager
there 's a jew boy deputy d a
warrants was local celebrity as a cop
they want to see you upstairs
the d a s office
back then i told myself i didn 't care
bucky this is chief ted green
deputy district attorney ellis UNknown
read that out loud dwight
that 's running in the sunday times
before the war the city of angels
was UNknown with two local fighters
mr fire and mr ice never fought each other
but duty brought them to the los angeles police department
blanchard cracked the boulevard citizens bank robbery case in 1939
and captured thrill killer tomas dos santos
UNknown served with distinction during the UNknown suit wars
on election day voters are going to be asked to vote on a bond proposal
to UNknown the UNknown 's equipment

what do you say bucky ?
i was just telling kay here about our new hobby
are you a fight fan miss lake ?
no lee used to drag me
i was taking art classes so i 'd sketch
she made me quit fighting the UNknown
didn 't want me doing the vegetable shuffle
i promise not to hurt you
that won 't make UNknown very happy
oh he 's got money on me ?
you win you get warrants
what 's in it for you ?
well betting works both ways
my girl 's got a taste for nice things and i can 't afford to let her down
keep talking about me in third person
what do you think of all this miss lake ?
well for civic reasons i hope the UNknown is UNknown for UNknown this farce
for personal reasons i hope lee wins
and for UNknown reasons i hope you both look good with your shirts off
hey you haven 't finished this plane yet
can you finish that ?
if you could just come by and clean the place up keep an eye on him for a week or so
guess what i hear is right
you UNknown l want to place this with mickey cohen 's UNknown
he 's got blanchard 2 1
i UNknown e done my homework
i 'm not betting on me pete
blanchard 's the hero here
that 's the way the story 's supposed to go
well at least he looks good with his shirt off
where 's your UNknown ?
i was never any good
ended up with a master 's in history
education 's an expensive habit
he shouldn 't have quit fighting
besides police work gives him a sense of order
do you have a girlfriend dwight ?
so he quits fighting for you puts you through school
why aren 't you married ?
you know UNknown 's against UNknown
probably cost him a stripe
so where 's the diamonds and the UNknown huh ?
the gym was packed to the rafters
a wild crowd hungry to see what was in us
i already knew what was in us
i was trading warrants for a close out on old bad debts
the eight grand i was going to clear was enough to maintain the old man in a good clean rest home for three years
you 'r e out !
it 's nice isn 't it papa ?

it couldn 't have worked out better if you 'd planned it could it dwight ?
well i could UNknown e beat him
i don 't know sweetheart
bucky was somebody back in the day

might even be worth those front teeth of yours dwight
a toast to proposition b
to the UNknown blanchard UNknown bigger than louis UNknown
from november through the new year
after tours of duty lee and i would go to the house and find kay
sometimes she 'd make dinner for us
other times the three of us would go out on the town
UNknown rape armed robbery felony UNknown
mr nash pistol whipped a little old lady at a stickup near UNknown park tuesday morning
junior nash was an UNknown UNknown shit UNknown who came west and took all us locals for easy marks just because we prefer our cowboys to look like gene UNknown
of course i didn 't care if he was a hard man or what he thought about anything
he raped children and beat senior citizens to death
he was a coward and i wanted to put him down
i got a tip for the UNknown who 's going to be at norton and coliseum tonight
we 'r e going !
baby he 's gonna cut us a real good deal on this
i have been knowing him for a long time
you ain 't got to worry about a thing okay ?
you ain 't got to worry
he 's going to take care of me real soon
and i mean real soon
i haven 't heard of a clean cop baxter
i just want to go home
same reason why you do this to me
you know why i do this to you
where is this guy ?
listen this is the last time
i was half asleep but lee had his boxer 's wits about him
he felt the blow coming
get your UNknown hands off me man
i ain 't done nothing !
yeah what do you call that shooting gallery back there ?
well that 's about it
thank you for your time detective and for the good police work
blanchard knew the white guy i guess
it 's a busy neighborhood
no reporters view the body
you photo men finish taking your pictures now
coroner 's men put a sheet on the body as soon as they are done
we set up a perimeter six feet back
any reporter crosses it arrest him
now gentlemen before this gets out of hand
let 's put the UNknown on something
with publicity you get confessions
with confessions you get UNknown liars and false leads
so we keep some things quiet
the ear to ear facial UNknown UNknown you keep this information to yourselves
not your wives not your girlfriends no other officers and i mean no
UNknown what the hell are you doing here ?
where the hell 's blanchard ?
nash might be renting a room in that building over there
i heard something on the radio about a shooting
hey raymond nash remember ?
we need to go check out that room
but he beat a woman to death
i don 't want to talk about it
lee baxter fitch just happened to be there ?
what do you know about it ?
he knew one of the guys so
dwight was it you or them ?
hey kay who 's bobby dewitt ?
i know he 's an old beef of lee 's
but he doesn 't want to talk about it and he gets out in a week
you know who he is ?
i UNknown l take care of it
who are these men who feed on others ?
what do they feel when they cut their names into somebody else 's life ?
it was the case that made lee 's career
he 'd never said a word about it and i 'd never asked
dewitt got 10 to life in san quentin
lee got kay or maybe it was the other way around
yeah priority for homicide division not us
nice white girl gets UNknown
got to show the voters they did the right thing passing the bond issue
it 's a plus buck
we don 't miss this
maybe she wasn 't such a nice girl
maybe that old lady that nash UNknown was somebody 's loving granny
maybe we let the bureau handle this and we get back to our job before nash UNknown somebody else
got any other UNknown ?
yeah maybe we UNknown e had enough headlines
with or without you buck
mr UNknown can you assure the public that you will find the murderer before he strikes again ?
you got us detached ?
i gave UNknown a memo saying nash blew our jurisdiction
are you fucking nuts ?
this is the main event
just give me another week with this girl
what 's your problem with this ?
on gross UNknown we have a female UNknown between 16 and 30
the cadaver is presented in two halves with UNknown level with the UNknown
through and through UNknown of both mouth corners
no visible UNknown on the neck
UNknown UNknown on the wing tips of the UNknown bones
a puncture wound here in the palm
investigation of upper half UNknown UNknown reveals no free flowing blood
UNknown stomach spleen liver all removed
is it all right to smoke doctor ?
lower half of cadaver reveals removal of all UNknown organs
what 's your best guess ?
well here 's what she wasn 't she wasn 't raped and she wasn 't pregnant
in terms of the UNknown UNknown the cause of death is either the mouth wound here or she was beaten to death with something like a baseball bat
what about her insides ?
i say then he drained the blood from the body and washed it clean probably in a bathtub
have you got a name yet ?
other than that she 's clean
four sisters parents divorced her father 's here in l a
oh and i hear he sold some old photos of her to the herald
i got an alibi just in case you think i did it
tighter than a crab 's ass and that is airtight
we would like to express our condolences for the loss of your daughter
yeah i know who you are
neither of you 'd have lasted a round against jim jeffries
and as for betty she called the tune she paid the piper
you want to hear my alibi ?
yeah since you 'r e so anxious to tell it

how about the world of high finance ?
how about the movies ?
you girls are all trying to break in right ?
she came around last christmas bragging about getting her big break
guess after all those screen tests she finally got a part
but she had a tendency to
do you know the names of any of her boyfriends ?
i mean i don 't want to tell any tales out of school but i do remember them being up on hollywood boulevard speaking to this older woman
and she she was wearing a man 's suit and had a man 's short haircut
but it was just that once
miss UNknown are you saying they were talking to a UNknown ?
we 'r e not done yet

hollywood was a cow pasture but the silent UNknown were booming
georgie got work as a lighting man me building houses

then put in another six hours by UNknown
are you feeling well ?
would you like to contribute to the conversation ?

i hear many of them know mr
i will sing for my supper when mayor UNknown comes to dinner but not for madeleine 's male whores

your mother would love that
the kind who takes pills the doctor gives her so she doesn 't have to admit to being a UNknown
daddy bought rotten lumber and old movie sets from mack UNknown and built houses out of them
that 's how he really made his money
he 's got UNknown all over l a

last summer i heard about a girl who looked like me
i left notes at a couple of places
your look alike wants to meet you things like that
that 's how i met her at laverne 's with lorna
why 'd you want to meet betty short anyway ?
i UNknown e worked hard to be loose
but the way people described betty it was like she was a natural

then he drove us back to l a
where was this house exactly ?

you are a political animal and for the sake of your pension
i suggest that you grovel
it is now 8 15 in the morning

i was hoping he 'd be here
well it is 8 15 and he is not here and neither are his letters of apology
UNknown get out of my sight
try and be a police officer
we forgot about junior nash
here he is dead in the middle of a stickup
he was trash and a killer and i 'd been right from the beginning
i beat up a wall
losing the first UNknown blanchard fight got me local celebrity warrants and close to nine grand in cash
winning the UNknown got me a sprained wrist two UNknown knuckles and the rest of the day off
i picked up lorna UNknown yesterday
she had a copy of a stag film her and betty short playing les
and i checked the case file
i 'm withholding evidence for you
it 's a fair trade but it shakes me
are you sure there isn 't anything you haven 't told me about you and betty ?
betty and i made love once that one time last summer
bobby dewitt 's probably in l a by now
lee always said i 'd be safe
he had a little sister
why didn 't you tell me this before ?
he made me promise never to tell you
he thought it made him too easy to figure
well it sure explains some things
kay where 's lee ?
if you know you should tell me
kay bobby dewitt just got out
lee 's all hopped up on UNknown so what do you think is going to happen ?
UNknown friedman called a couple of hours ago
the guy from new year 's ?
get up against that wall over there
i ain 't out one week and
you 'r e here for a drug deal with UNknown friedman
look i 'm just looking for a place to take a piss
man oh UNknown i ain 't seen blanchard since my fucking trial
yeah but he 's been on your mind
and you UNknown e been on his mind
i 'm thinking that you let the word out there knowing he 'd come down here
look maybe i UNknown my trap at trial
i don 't know what his version is
what 's your version ?
my men are instructed not to take any chances and you did have a gun
the guy with the choke rope
i assume dewitt brought him for muscle
no identification nothing left of his face after he hit the fountain
you understand why we must handle things like this huh ?
see what we got here ?
want to say something ?
stolen witness reports medical records autopsy photos
lee had turned his life inside out and my dad 's apartment into the black dahlia 's house of horrors
i confessed to the only priest i needed
how long have you known about this ?
why show me now ?
he 's not coming back is he buck ?
did you tell kay ?
well that 's as far as it goes then
our boy doesn 't need any more headlines
i want you to stick with me here
you UNknown e got tears running down your face
what 's the matter with you ?
you must have a lot of fun
you look like you have a hell of a lot of fun
i 'm a fun UNknown gal
you got any special guys that you you know
yeah i met him in florida
and it was one of those things that was
gosh i don 't know if you UNknown e experienced this before but it was love at first sight
that 's what it was
he asked me to marry him that night
and then the next day he was just gone
well that ask you to marry him always works
no he promised he 'd come back
he was an air force captain which is why he had to leave
and you know what he used to do ?
he used to write me such beautiful UNknown romantic love letters
so what happened to prince charming ?
well the night that he was supposed to come back he was called to do one last mission and his plane crashed over india
and now he 's dead
boy you sure know how to tell a funny story
i 'm UNknown the ka UNknown sheets for tomorrow
i 'm going to kay 's
wednesday nights were the nights she 'd make lee and me a big dinner so
we haven 't done it since
we 'r e going to try
should we say something ?
we haven 't said anything
i feel like i haven 't said anything right
haven 't done anything right
i could UNknown e saved him
i could UNknown e saved him
i cut my foot on a bathroom tile
you got it in you to replace a few ?
i 'd always wondered where he kept it
were you ever going to tell me ?
he 'd given all his money to ben UNknown and he
he wanted to buy us a home
i didn 't know there was any left
were you ever going to tell me ?
bobby did do the bank job dwight
don 't get the wrong idea
i don 't know what kind of idea i got right now
things were getting really bad between me and bobby and i had to get out
i knew this guy that bobby made me be with once
he was a UNknown who let it slip that he sometimes UNknown to the cops for dope money
and then last year the guy
lee had given him 1 000 for introducing us
he found out that bobby was getting out and he threatened to tell him that we stole from him
he wanted money that we didn 't have dwight
what were we going to do ?
promise me promise me you UNknown l forgive him for dewitt
it doesn 't matter to us
what was the guy 's name ?
kay tell me the guy 's name
baxter fitch and then dewitt
you 'r e so good at some things
he loved both of us dwight so much
the basic rule of homicide applied
the UNknown of a fairy tale only a band aid to cover a fractured life
i didn 't believe in fairy tales
an old friend stuffed him
i just never imagined georgie so
daddy paid to have him buried at the family plot in scotland
i don 't get modern art
i doubt modern art gets you either
kay what the hell are you doing here ?
what am i doing here ?
you follow me here after what you UNknown e done ?
you lied to me !
i lied for you !
i lied for us !
what could i do but lie dwight ?
you could have told me the truth
she looks like that dead girl !
how sick are you ?
she looks like that dead girl !
how sick are you ?
the set was enough to tie UNknown to the UNknown movie but not to the murder
georgie introduced me to mack UNknown
one of my UNknown said the goddamn pipes are UNknown gas
there UNknown l be hell to pay
it 's about time i showed the three of you good old scotland
i don 't want to go to europe daddy
you 'r e always talking about how dreadful and provincial it is
yeah but it 's got what you need lassie
what is that emmett ?
you killed elizabeth short and the two of you covered it up
you made that stag film with lorna and betty
i UNknown e seen the set
put that gun down laddie
you might be half right
let 's talk the man who laughs
i UNknown e seen the movie
i UNknown e got you
so you don 't like my taste in art
georgie was always sneaking around daddy 's properties
betty called short of cash as usual
i put daddy on and he offered her money to date a nice man he knew
you must UNknown e known he was a sick fuck then
i mean he liked to touch dead things
i mean his father was a surgeon
did you know that ?
you did him enough damage emmett
now you let him go !
i would appreciate it if you just stopped shooting things officer though
the rich don 't own art just for themselves
we safe keep it for future generations
how did emmett damage georgie ?
what did he do to make him go so crazy ?
who made what made who crazy ?
not that emmett cared about that
but he was her father
and for that he ruined george 's face
when he got out of hospital
i gave him the hugo book as a present
he had worked construction on that movie with emmett
it was always one of his favorites
what about betty short ?
well that was the UNknown joke of all
and your husband bought her for georgie
he 's a shy wee lad but i
it was the second swing woke her up
she looked so like my UNknown
we UNknown l ruin you in court
it was neat enough for the papers but that didn 't make it clean
i guess they get to die differently too
did you come to pay your respects or fuck my sister ?
i came to talk to you about lee blanchard
he came here didn 't he ?
adios yourself back to the halls of tripoli UNknown
lee knew everything about you and elizabeth short
he knew everything didn 't he ?
i don 't know what you 'r e saying
i went by your house today
i talked to your sister martha
she told me that a policeman named lee blanchard came by the house asking questions about you and elizabeth short
she told him that the two of you were close
martha was always jealous of me
i beat up a wall
on the night that he went to the olympic to settle an old score you tracked him there
i UNknown e been pointing my gun at a lot of people this week
i haven 't had a chance to shoot anybody yet
what do you think ?
i think you 'd rather fuck me than kill me but you don 't have the guts to do either
you 'r e a boxer not a fighter
you 'r e a murderer
you should thank me for lee blanchard
if it weren 't for me you wouldn 't have had the balls to fuck your partner 's girl
you don 't fuck her anymore
because you 'd rather fuck me
you don 't talk about them
you chose me over her
you UNknown l choose me over him
he was going to take daddy 's money and leave
you 'd never shoot me
don 't forget who i look like
ones i 'd loved and ones who 'd loved me
people i 'd betrayed and people i needed to protect
and for the first time in my life
i had people that knew that for the UNknown of times in the darkest of places
jack japan is kind of strange now isn 't it ?
here are the goods i promised
it 's the key to the door of our future
a city could easily disappear
everything will be all right
he will bring judgment upon this world
everything will be over in an instant
what are you doing ?
we still need russia 's confirmation
a police unit set up to counter UNknown
starting with UNknown we UNknown l request an official announcement of level 1 on all international UNknown
you still can 't get a listing of the russian terror group ?
i just need a bit more time
are you even listening ? and that is informal within the police force
here are the satellite pictures of UNknown
it seems like the whole area has been sealed off by the military
the town disappeared ? !
the citizens died in an instant
i didn 't think i 'd meet a beautiful woman like you in tokyo
i want to know more about you
just because you want to know more
what was the thing you smuggled here from russia ?
the last key entered tokyo
the last key entered tokyo
he 's a spy who went into hiding for eight months because of the incident in russia 's UNknown
inside his body this chip was found
according to the message left in it it is uncertain what happened in UNknown
there is a possibility of a terror attack
we think the next target is tokyo and that they will strike within a few days
leaving that aside we must find out what exactly happened in russia
is there any news from UNknown san in russia ?
okay but again no courtesy !
that guy might be able to do it
the genius UNknown from that incident
do you mean falcon ?
the last blood national holiday is coming soon
the last blood national holiday is coming soon
what are you doing let go !
god punishment dealt in an instant
the last blood national holiday blood national holiday
it 's been a long time UNknown UNknown
but i haven 't done anything lately
until two years ago you were a legendary UNknown
your internet alias was falcon
when we discovered that you were only a junior high student we were really surprised
a town disappeared in the far east of russia
soon they UNknown l try to do the same with tokyo
i want you to find out what happened
in this town there 's a major russian military installation
we want you to hack into their computer
i thought you could do it
you mean you want me to commit a crime ?
if you think that way you already committed a crime two years ago
chief please give up already
what can that brat do ?
this isn 't child 's play
you your friends and your siblings
that 's got nothing to do with me
soon he will bring judgment upon this world
soon he will bring judgment upon this world
this is a free UNknown
do not UNknown in any UNknown UNknown get it free at d addicts com
please visit us at UNknown UNknown com UNknown
a and t g and c are UNknown like this
and when you cut that you will get this section
you have seen that before
if you take t and a
if you 'r e being noisy UNknown will catch me
if you keep this up you UNknown l have to repeat a year
do you think this is the time to play games ?
some parents complained about seeing a student working part time at a convenience store
i can 't pay this month 's tuition at all
at this rate even from my point of view i can 't avoid UNknown you from school
is it all right doing something like that ?
UNknown UNknown lost both of her parents and is living with relatives
because she doesn 't want to trouble them with tuition or living expenses she has to work part time
to suddenly suspend her that 's something that shouldn 't be forgiven right ?
if we can stir up the student 's opinions i think the school may reconsider the decision
i think school 's attention to rules should be changed too
but on the other hand won 't fussing about it and creating an uproar hurt UNknown ?
and if we screw up we might be in the focus of the school superiors
UNknown UNknown are you listening ?
i UNknown l leave early then
today was the UNknown wasn 't it ?
it 's always the same
dad said he could be coming home early today
it 's been a long time since we all ate together
that 's why this food
you shouldn 't expect too much
has that guy ever kept a promise ?
that game you gave me the other day was really interesting !
people who come up with those ideas are great aren 't they ?
it would sell really well
something urgent came up and i can 't come home
please eat dinner with UNknown
see i told you so
if you take my suspension back i will do anything
as proof i attached a picture
you have a phone call
please come to the staff room right away
what are you doing ?
hurry get to your classroom !
last night i received this UNknown
after serving this school for many years
biology teacher UNknown sensei is retiring
though his replacement has yet to be confirmed all student do not worry and please continue to work hard towards a higher goal
suspension cancelled that 's a relief isn 't it UNknown
maybe god exists after all
i know a lot about computers so i can explain it
someone probably sent an UNknown virus to UNknown UNknown 's computer
then that person found an embarrassing picture of UNknown and flooded the net with it
who could it be ?
i think he 's definitely somewhere in this school
hm do you think so ?
but this will become an article for sure won 't it ?
it 's no use asking that guy
what do you mean 't hat guy ?
it 's you guys again ?
i told you we don 't have anything to do with each other
that 's not true anymore right ?
you hacked into a school computer last night didn 't you ?
that 's a crime !
it hurts it hurts i said it hurts !
then you UNknown l UNknown come with us won 't you ?
that 's blackmail isn 't it ?
this UNknown is being provided only for the special third division
it 's a present for you
what if i don 't want it ?
then we will arrest you
yes we 'r e dirty
in this country there 's no peace at all
spies and terrorists are crawling around
if we use proper means we can 't protect this country
with your ability the country could be saved
why don 't you use it ?
can you let me talk to my dad ?
even though i told you to quit UNknown it ended up in this situation
let 's not talk about it anymore
i will refuse the matter in your place
if this hadn 't happened
i wouldn 't have known about you at all
if something happens i might not be able to protect you until the end
at crucial times protecting the country is more important than protecting family
i was never able to do a family like thing with you two or with your dead mother
in exchange for accepting this
i want you to come back home early tomorrow evening
UNknown always makes dinner and waits for you at home !
tomorrow whatever happens i will go home early
UNknown games in the morning ?
since UNknown sensei suddenly resigned due to family reasons there will be a new teacher for you guys from today on
miss UNknown graduated from an american graduate school
you guys really are lucky that such a great teacher came to this school
i think this question will come up later on anyway so i will say it now
i currently do not have a boyfriend
the type of boys i like are guys who like trees or flowers
and maybe rich people ?
well then let 's start class
i heard that you UNknown e finished chapter two so today we UNknown l move on to chapter three
what are you being fascinated by ?
huh in what way was i ?
it would be better if you didn 't see this sensei
it 's probably a porn game
when the lesson 's over come see me
let 's pull ourselves together i 'm beginning the lesson
open your textbooks to page 143

apparently our secret files have been copied illegally
those files are forbidden to take outside
it seems like an inside job
if we can solve the code we may be able to find something out
don 't tell anyone about this
i 'm heading there from UNknown now
UNknown UNknown i heard a bothersome rumor in russia
a part of russia 's UNknown is secretly selling japan 's enterprise at the future 's market
it means that japan 's shares will UNknown before long
and i also got hold of something bothering me
UNknown san could the two of us possibly meet somewhere alone ?
what does that mean ?
um i 'm sorry for earlier
but it 's boring to eat alone
is it all right ?
UNknown is a form of gratitude said before eating
was there any important data in it ?
it 's okay it 's okay !
um i have proper backup data
i will compensate you for sure i 'm really sorry
this is what i wanted to give you

please visit us at UNknown UNknown com UNknown
i don 't care if you 'r e from the police board or from public safety but don 't hang around here bitch !
it 's a bother if you guys who are trying to rescue the country cause such a riot
what did you say asshole ? !
try saying that again !
he dealt with his enemy without leaving any traces
he probably received training from an army somewhere
what are you doing ?
chief UNknown gave it to me to investigate it
but if that 's the case how did the person who shot chief UNknown know about it ?
he must have been following either me or chief UNknown
but you would have recognized that right away
you both are not amateurs
didn 't you guide the murderer here to kill chief UNknown ?
i found out who copied our secret files
UNknown san it was you
you UNknown l have to come with us
i 'm sorry UNknown i don 't think i can come home tonight
please apologize to UNknown for me
you promised her didn 't you ?
i involved you in something unexpected
stop the UNknown right now
if you don 't you UNknown l become their target too
what are you saying ?
we won 't see each other anymore but please believe me on this
i will always be on your and UNknown 's side
no matter what others say
remember very well the words i 'm about to say
i will say them only once
don 't say them to anyone at all until you absolutely need them
soon he will bring judgement upon this world
everything will be over in an instant
please take care of me
i will say only one thing
don 't speak to that guy no matter what happens
if you do you will be UNknown by him
i 'm from the police headquarters
what on earth happened ?
honestly he killed a person and ran away
that must be some kind of mistake because my dad is
well if he contacts you could you call this number here please ?
i 'm UNknown from the police headquarter investigation section
even if you waited here i think it 's useless
dad doesn 't come home that often
today i made dad 's favorite meat and potato stew
when do you think dad will come home ?
why are you lying ?
dad won 't come home right ?
a detective came by earlier
what are you saying ?
that must be a mistake !
there 's no way dad would do such a thing
let 's sit down for now
they really did great job in hiding them
i 'm here to deliver your computer rack
it 's the base sequence of dna
this must be some genetic information right ?
ahhh UNknown this seems to take some time
he always came by when he needed something from me
not to say i 'm unhappy that you came
do you want to eat it ?
a young and beautiful woman coming here is rather welcome
we suspect him to have UNknown secret information into illegal channels
UNknown into illegal channels ?
that must be a mistake
if you hear anything from UNknown could you please contact us ?
it hurts it hurts !
stop UNknown into russia at once !
this is an official UNknown from UNknown i
dad told me the same thing
that 's why i decided to continue
russia must be involved in this incident somehow
i might be able to prove my dad 's innocence
don 't say stupid things
your life UNknown l also be in danger if you continue
it 's better if you do not take this job lightly
it 's got nothing to do with you
this is a matter just between me and my father
moreover if an act of UNknown happens millions of people will die right ?
if i run away now it 's still the same
as expected of UNknown 's son
i will get authorization from chief UNknown
this is a free UNknown
do not UNknown in any UNknown UNknown get it free at d addicts com
i will kill that person for you
there 's a party tonight
i UNknown e received the last key
i 'm preparing for a festival right now i 'm really busy
that means everything 's going well
everything except you that is
why do you think i let you go to falcon ?
falcon is wandering around russia 's military installations
i ruined the UNknown he got from UNknown i
also that kid is only
it 's better not to take falcon lightly
he recognized the bugs we planted right away
but we already got hold of the most important information
we discovered the most important thing to falcon
if falcon catches a spoil in russia
but it 's okay i made a lot of progress
i already have back up for the required procedures
you know UNknown like that are expensive
i finally reached the target 's computer but it 's strange
it seems like someone invaded it before me
he was close to being caught by the surveillance system but he barely managed to escape
that 's why there are weak spots in the system
he made a wide gaping UNknown
i will break in now
yes i did it !
it looks like there are only system files
what could that be ?
but the security system seems to monitor every thirty seconds for any suspicious movements
i have only ten seconds for the UNknown
if it takes longer i will be caught
i UNknown e started the UNknown
it 's slow this scrap machine !
this file is password protected
first i have to find out the password 's UNknown method
then we UNknown l continue this later
i UNknown l guard you without being noticed
more importantly please guard UNknown
though his father 's being chased he 's still going to school huh ?
yes isn 't it ?
that should be all right
well then UNknown chan you go first
i UNknown l come after you later so that the detective doesn 't see me
don 't worry i will protect you for sure UNknown chan
it looks like you hate my lesson very much
wake up or i UNknown l get angry
come see me after class
here as an apology for last time
can i have that ?
do you like it ?
last night you stayed up all night didn 't you ?
you 'r e the only student who sleeps in my class
even though i did you a favor by especially wearing a short skirt
you won 't tell me more ?
no but it 's a really important job
then why don 't you do it here ?
is that all right ?
frankly speaking it seems interesting
UNknown UNknown you 'r e a really interesting person
ah well then can i borrow that ?
say you can 't use the present i gave you ?
but i 'm afraid the wireless lan might be UNknown
this seems to be difficult
i can transform the data with the password key
if i found the password key i 'd be able to put it back to its former state
how long will it take ?
even if you use a high performance computer a month and a half
through the ability to trade files with other computers connected to the net
UNknown is a peer to peer file sharing program much like UNknown
well it 's like UNknown
using that i was able to create a powerful UNknown computer on the internet
on the internet there are millions of computers connected
and they 'r e not always using their full performance level all the time
if you connect them and split all the work between them this round robin UNknown me to go into offense
it 's like distributed UNknown
with this we UNknown l get the file back in our hands
about that he swiftly cracked the data
but don 't worry if it were the real thing
instead of killing him we UNknown l let him live and use him
it 's only a home video
please call for a meeting of the national counter UNknown department
this is probably a virus made by cross breeding smallpox and UNknown
it 's called bloody x
if i 'm right that was from the UNknown two years ago
the data that public safety special third division 's chief UNknown obtained in russia contained the dna base sequence that matched with bloody x
sensei if this virus were spread how many victims would there be ?
this virus spreads through the air easily floating from one person to the next
because of the really gruesome way of dying and the quick spreading the former soviet union abandoned the development of it as a chemical weapon
if the virus were spread the number of victims in the first week would be more than eight million people
this is only the predicted extent
what about an UNknown virus ?
two years ago you should have started developing one
moreover the development of an UNknown virus is difficult and takes a lot of time and funds
knowing all this the ones who decided to abandon the development midway were all of you right ?
return to the office for now
why were you so surprised ?
if you do as i say i UNknown l give your sister back
hack into the system of UNknown 's electric power central control center
get me the administrator password
because falcon 's little sister has to undergo UNknown soon right ?
don 't say ridiculous things !
ah you mustn 't tell anyone about this
the police are unreasonable you know ?
what is she doing ? !
UNknown UNknown has been kidnapped
you were with her what were you doing idiot ? !
go to UNknown UNknown UNknown right away
because i did unnecessary things
because i didn 't listen to dad UNknown is
what were you doing ?
you promised to protect us didn 't you ?
don 't mess around !
i UNknown l apologize for not protecting her
but more important now is UNknown chan 's rescue
i attached a transmitter to her bag so we can locate her through UNknown
it seems like the other side found our UNknown transmitter
those guys must be in contact with the terrorists for sure
isn 't that woman you came with from the police ?
so you don 't care what happens to your sister right ?
that 's so funny !
i UNknown l start UNknown right now so please don 't do anything to UNknown
i will wait only ten minutes
thank you for the password
get up and then proceed 5 steps
someone told me how to take revenge on you
i decided to work for that person
i UNknown e always lived with all my might
thank you for the password
thanks to you millions of people will die
what are you doing by yourself ?
where are you right now ?
it looks like she 's been injected with UNknown
there 's nothing wrong with her
i think my wife will wake up soon too
there 's no meaning in letting the culprit escape UNknown chan
has UNknown contacted his son ?
it seems like he contacted him once because of the russian UNknown incident
doing things on your own what 's the meaning of this ? !
i told the criminal the administrator password to UNknown 's electric power central control center
you 'r e just UNknown kid
what are you saying ?
my little sister 's life doesn 't mean anything to you right ?
but she 's my precious little sister !
there wasn 't any other way to save her !
right now the UNknown are trying to invade the electric power central control center by using the UNknown UNknown and UNknown its program
do you understand what you UNknown e done ?
if that happens all of tokyo will experience a huge blackout !
there won 't be a blackout
i 'm different from you idiots
what did you just say ? !
they can only UNknown the place inside of the cage i set there
they can do nothing but struggle
we have succeeded in UNknown the control system
it would be nice if you 'd catch the UNknown during that time
you understand don 't you ?
it 's the UNknown UNknown !
we have to check which districts it supplies !
hey let 's head for the party
the UNknown UNknown supplies electricity to the whole UNknown district
to spread the virus you 'd need a place where people are crowded together without much air
what 's the UNknown district 's population UNknown distribution in this time zone ?
i 'm looking it up right now
you don 't have any courtesy do you UNknown ?
the station or the subway system ?
there 's also the assembly hall for evening events but they UNknown e already closed
if there 's a blackout the air conditioning system will stop
national police agency 's public safety 's special third division
please allow the investigation squad to enter
follow the criminal investigation squad 's plans
inspect strange people trash boxes plants and such where there might be a virus weapon
make the withdrawal of equipment as fast as possible !
the break in force is on standby at the 2nd front gate within 50 metres
close the shops in order beginning with the third floor
get the customers UNknown outside
why did you come here ?
don 't play around kid
your job 's over right ?
it 's time for adults now !
why is there a blackout ?
that brat said there wouldn 't be a blackout and there is one after all !
UNknown what 's the situation in the control room ?
the emergency power supply should start working any moment now
from headquarter to central control UNknown
there 's no answer !
UNknown there 's no answer from UNknown
are you all right ?
someone has cut the supply from the UNknown UNknown UNknown
i UNknown l go check the situation there
a dose of fine powder came out of a small sized spray
seal off the whole building !
i officially announce plan a
main gate gate 2 blocked
UNknown the people on the main and shopping courts
letting down the fire UNknown shutters in mall blocks UNknown
the tokyo fire defense agency UNknown rescue will arrive in ten minutes
the virus inspection and UNknown are complete
i will now let the people outside
until we confirm the virus is real or not you must not let a single person outside !
from now on i want you to strictly abide by my orders !
are you all right ?
the fire brigade has arrived
public safety 's special third division 's UNknown
something virus like has been spread in this mall
it 's a possible terrorist attack
then the fire brigade will go in and collect some of the substance
check everything to the last bit
analysis result confirm the analysis result
if we could UNknown an UNknown virus into the infected bodies within 30 minutes we could still make it !
analyze the virus hurry !
what are you looking at ?
why aren 't you doing anything ?
do you want to see us all killed ?
i have a UNknown from the state control room
a possible virus infection occurred inside the mall so they made the following decision
whatever happens don 't let people outside !
those who go out will be
we 'r e prepared to shoot !
wait a second chief !
this is an order UNknown !
i don 't want to do this either !
but tokyo will vanish just like UNknown in russia
we won 't let that happen
i won 't give up till the last minute !
everyone inside is desperately fighting too !
don 't go out !
please don 't go outside !
because of me these people will
it 's not your fault
they directly attacked the UNknown UNknown to cause this blackout
it didn 't have anything to do with what you did
you and i have only a few more hours to live
what are the people outside doing ?
why aren 't they rescuing us ?
anyone who goes out will be shot
if even one person in here gets out he UNknown l be the source of infection and will be responsible for millions of people 's deaths
the one dressed like a clown who left the balloons
idiot why didn 't you tell me earlier ?
if i UNknown this system we should be able to get our hands on the surveillance cameras images
the culprit who did this might be somewhere in the building
the one dressed like a clown
let 's search for him !
do something save us !
we have no choice but to open it !
are you all right ?
get out of the way !
out of the way !
the virus is fake !
don 't look at me !
our power is more than that
falcon is in our hands
is there someone you want to kill ?
shopping mall had an explosion or UNknown gas uproar
turned out to be a prank the police are stupid
i UNknown e come to deliver the goods
if there is someone say it

UNknown UNknown where are you now ?
come to the tall building downtown
time limit is thirty minutes
if something happens to UNknown
our enemy completed the rehearsal
if that had been the real thing and there had been an infection
at the shopping mall you had entertained me a lot
but the next one will be real
i ve sent the real virus
the name is UNknown yukiko
what is your aim ?
you mean UNknown UNknown ?
you would have traced this phone call soon
the call came from a public telephone at 503 UNknown park
earlier the shopping mall had an explosion or UNknown gas uproar
turned to out to be a prank the police are stupid
you re UNknown yukiko right ?
congratulations you ve just UNknown the switch for a bomb
if you want to stop it hack into UNknown i and completely UNknown the copy of the christmas massacre data file
a complete UNknown is impossible !
you can do it falcon
what will you do ?
soon UNknown i will be in an uproar
it s an outside access so i can t shut down
the data server has been UNknown
it seems like he succeeded
i wonder if bluebird could have done the same
i will not forgive any failures
i m drawing your blood now
what s wrong with me ?
this looks like the UNknown bomb that was used in the UNknown london underground terror attack
looking at the amount of explosive substance i presume it has a range of five meters
hurry up and stop it !
there s no time left !
it s a sacrifice !
what are you doing ? !
don t act on your own
orders are to be obeyed
it seems like the sacrifice was indeed infected
we re protecting this country
UNknown into UNknown i is real UNknown
it was you who involved us in this !
we have our first infected person
you re not eating much are you ?
won t you eat a bit more ?
where are my examination results ?
when can i go home ? !
i will ask the doctor
could you lend me a computer ?
people are waiting for my posts
i will ask okay ?
why are you examining UNknown ?
i want to believe that too
but the examination was UNknown i s decision
that s the first infected person
in two to three hours the symptoms will show
she il start running a high fever and bleeding from from her nose mouth and every UNknown UNknown of her UNknown organs
she won t last another day
UNknown yukiko didn t have a boyfriend and didn t stand out at her UNknown
writing in her UNknown seems to be her only hobby
we couldn t find any connection to the terrorists
it didn t matter who their victim was
they re continuing their rehearsal to test the virus destructive power next
if i were a terrorist i d do that
what about the main server that falcon hacked ?
we will restore the system server soon
was the copy of the russian data the only thing he UNknown ?
yes but we don t know if we can recover it
UNknown UNknown is only a high school student
we can t risk him doing what the terrorists say if they threaten him again
it s dangerous for him to continue UNknown in the investigation
then let s prepare to observe him 24 hours a day
and i don t care if it s a little extreme
you want to use him as bait ?
the probability of UNknown UNknown UNknown him is also high
moreover we have very little information on the terrorists
so we have to rely on that
why are you getting cold feet ?
attack is the best defense isn t it ?
you re digging your own grave by thinking like that
even at best UNknown lacked that
you will replace UNknown and command at crime scenes
when is the cabinet meeting for emergency measures ?
i already made a proposal to the chief cabinet secretary
perhaps this time we can expect good communication
UNknown how s your ?
nothing abnormal showed up in the examination results
what s with that ?
yeah let s go home
good work on the night shift
are you going to school ?
even if you wait here my father won t return
we il know for sure if we stay here
more importantly please protect UNknown
sorry but our job is to arrest a murderer
you don t need to worry
i don t need to worry right ?
are you all right ?
hey wait a moment !
i m so relieved UNknown isn t here anymore
what happened to your father was terrible
there s no way he would do something like that
we thought isn t there anything we can do ?
well well we re your friends from the newspaper club
a school friend fighting against adversity believing in his father protecting his little sister
how s that for a UNknown ?
we il take this up in this month s issue
let s dig out the truth behind this incident and prove your father s innocence okay ?
look you re also worried about UNknown chan s health
we can all help you
why did you tell them about it ?
what are you hiding ?
the files were UNknown here too
i il restore them now
i found it ; this is it
i il play it now
they re planning to do the same in japan soon
last night the terrorists ordered me to hack and UNknown this data
what are you doing there skipping class ?
it s the country s decision
to bring in a murderous virus like that
what the hell were you doing ? !
because of your failure she will die here alone without knowing anything !
at least watch over her until her last moment
what s with that serious face ?
excuse my rudeness but where were you and what were you doing on christmas eve last year ?
can you answer me please ?
i watched a rented dvd alone
please let me see it
what s going on ?
i il cover up for you in front of UNknown ei and the rest
by the way the woman in the data earlier wasn t UNknown sensei
on december 24th and 25th last year she rented a dvd at a store in her neighborhood
hey UNknown does that mean ?
i ve checked the store s surveillance cameras carefully
that s not an alibi at all
where where s that nurse ?
yes it s within the limits
what are you up to ?
please let me apologize to you another time
shall we go together ?
sensei is there something you would like to eat ?
please let me treat you today
i had a great life
another foolish woman who wants to stand out
did she run out of material and so said she died ?
if you would just die
i understand how you must feel having been with the patient
she wasn t just a patient she was UNknown yukiko
please keep reporting the progress to me
the key s experiment succeeded
start the preparations for the festival
the door has been opened
the first infected person died
i need ten more minutes
idiot hurry and run !
i can t let it end here bye
ah that must be the security system
eh is it a burglar ?
then sensei i il go first
there s no one here
seems like it was a UNknown
that s good to hear
UNknown UNknown what happened ?
ah yes i lost my wallet
here it is that s good
sensei where s UNknown ?
we went out to eat together
wow how bad for UNknown !
i il try to call him now
if you re waiting for UNknown sensei it s useless
she s with me right now
it s a dangerous atmosphere
sensei isn t this room too hot ?
i wonder where i put the remote control
is it in another room ?
i il go look for it
it s quite cool when you open the windows
that s a nice breeze
UNknown UNknown you ve been behaving strangely
you seem worried about something in that room
about our christmas conversation earlier i made a mistake
on december 24th of last year
asking where you were that day doesn t have any meaning
because christmas in russia is on january 7th right ?
in russia christians are russian orthodox and because of that christmas is on january 7th
on january 7th of this year
sensei where were you ?
you mean i m back to being a suspect ?

you come most carefully upon your hour
tis now struck twelve get thee to bed francisco
for this relief much thanks
tis bitter cold and i am sick at heart
have you had quiet guard ?
and UNknown to the dane
who hath relieved you ?
say what is horatio there ?
welcome horatio welcome good marcellus
what has this thing appeared again tonight ?
horatio says 't is but our fantasy and will not let belief take hold of him
touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us
therefore i have UNknown him along with us to watch the minutes of this night that if again the apparition come he may approve our eyes and speak to it
tush tush 't will not appear
then let us once again UNknown your ears that are so fortified against our story what we have two nights seen
look where it comes again !
in the same figure like the king that 's dead
thou art a scholar speak to it horatio
looks it not like the king ?
most like it UNknown me with fear and wonder
it would be spoke to
what art thou that UNknown 's t this time of night together with that fair and UNknown form in which the majesty of buried denmark did sometimes march ?
by heaven i charge thee speak !
i charge thee speak !
tis gone and will not answer
before my god i might not this believe without the sensible and true UNknown of mine own eyes
thus twice before and jump at this dead hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch
what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night joint UNknown with the day ?
who is 't that can inform me ?
that can i at least the whisper goes so
lo where it comes again !
i UNknown l cross it though it blast me
if thou hast any sound or use of voice speak to me
shall i strike at it ?
do if it will not stand
we do it wrong being so UNknown to offer it the show of violence
for it is as is the air UNknown and our vain blows malicious mockery
it was about to speak when the cock crew
and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons
the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so UNknown 'd and so gracious is the time
so have i heard and do in part believe it
but look the morn in UNknown mantle clad walks o UNknown r the dew of UNknown high UNknown hill
break we our watch up and by my advice
let us UNknown what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him
though yet of hamlet our dear brother 's death the memory be green
and that it us UNknown to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe
nor have we UNknown barr 'd your better UNknown which have freely gone with this affair along
lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother
thus much the business is
to norway uncle of young UNknown that he suppress his nephew 's further march and threatening enterprise against our state
and we here dispatch you good cornelia and UNknown as our ambassadors to old norway
in that and in all things we show our duty
and now laertes what 's the news with you ?
have you your father 's leave ?
he hath my lord UNknown from me my slow leave
i do beseech you give him leave to go
take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will !
but now our cousin hamlet and our son
a little more than kin and less than kind
how is it that the clouds still hang on you ?
not so my lord i am too much i the sun
good hamlet cast thy UNknown colour off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark
do not for ever with thy UNknown ed UNknown seek for thy noble father in the dust
thou know 's t 't is common all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity
ay madam it is common
if it be why seems it so particular with thee ?
nay it is i know not seems
tis not alone my UNknown cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black together with all forms moods shapes of grief that can UNknown me truly
these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play
but i have that within which UNknown show these but the UNknown and the suits of woe
tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father
but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do UNknown sorrow
but to UNknown in obstinate UNknown is a course of UNknown stubbornness
in going back to school in
UNknown UNknown it is most UNknown to our desire
and i beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our UNknown UNknown cousin and our son
let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet
i pray thee stay with us go not to UNknown
i shall in all my best obey you madam
why 't is a loving and a fair reply
this gentle and UNknown accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace UNknown no UNknown health that denmark drinks today
o that this too too solid flesh would melt
thaw and resolve itself into a dew !
or that the everlasting had not fix 'd his canon UNknown UNknown self slaughter !
how weary stale flat and UNknown seem to me all the uses of this world !
tis an UNknown garden that grows to seed
things rank and gross in nature possess it merely
that it should come to this !
but two months dead nay not so much not two !
so excellent a king that was to this
so loving to my mother
that he might not UNknown the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly
why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month !
let me not think on 't
UNknown thy name is woman !
a little month or UNknown re those shoes were old with which she follow 'd my poor father 's body
like UNknown all tears why she even she !
a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mourn 'd longer
my father 's brother but no more like my father than i to hercules within a month
ere yet the salt of most UNknown tears had left the flushing in her UNknown eyes she married
o most wicked speed to post with such UNknown to UNknown sheets !
it is not nor it cannot come to good
but break my heart for i must hold my tongue
hail to your lordship !
or i do forget myself !
the same my lord and your poor servant ever
sir my good friend i UNknown l change that name with you
i am very glad to see you
but what in faith make you from UNknown ?
we UNknown l teach you to drink deep ere you depart
my lord i came to see your father 's funeral
i pray thee do not mock me fellow student
i think it was to see my mother 's wedding
indeed my lord it follow 'd hard upon
the funeral baked UNknown did UNknown furnish forth the marriage tables
methinks i see my father
in my mind 's eye horatio
he was a UNknown king
take him for all in all
i think i saw him UNknown
my lord the king your father
the king my father !
season your admiration with an UNknown ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you
for god 's love let me hear
two nights together had these gentlemen
marcellus and bernardo on their watch in the dead vast and middle of the night been thus encounter 'd
a figure like your father
armed at point exactly cap a UNknown appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and UNknown by them
in dreadful secrecy UNknown they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had deliver 'd the apparition comes
i knew your father these hands are not more like
but where was this ?
my lord upon the platform where we watch 'd
did you not speak to it ?
my lord i did but answer made it none
as i do live my honour 'd lord tis true
indeed sirs but this troubles me
hold you the watch tonight ?
arm 'd say you ?
from top to toe ?
my lord from head to foot
then saw you not his face ?
o yes my lord he wore his beaver up
what look 'd he UNknown ?
a countenance more in sorrow than in anger
i would i had been there
it would have much amazed you
stay 'd it long ?
not when i saw 't
his beard was UNknown ?
it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silver 'd
i will watch tonight perchance 't will walk again
if it assume my noble father 's person
i UNknown l speak to it though hell itself should UNknown and bid me hold my peace
i pray you all if you have UNknown conceal 'd this sight
let it be UNknown in your silence still and whatsoever else shall hap to night give it an understanding but no tongue
i will UNknown your loves
our duty to your honour
my father 's spirit in arms !
i doubt some foul play
would the night were come !
till then sit still my soul
foul deeds will rise though all the earth o UNknown UNknown them to men 's eyes
and sister as the winds give benefit and as convoy is assistant do not sleep but let me hear from you
do you doubt that ?
for hamlet and the trifling of his favour hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of UNknown nature
forward not permanent sweet not lasting
the perfume and UNknown of a minute no more
no more but so ?
perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor UNknown doth UNknown the virtue of his will
but you must fear his greatness weigh 'd his will is not his own
for he himself is subject to his birth
he may not as UNknown persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the safety and the health of this whole state
or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open
to his UNknown 'd UNknown
fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire
best safety lies in fear
youth to itself rebels though none else near
i stay too long but here my father comes
a double blessing is a double grace occasion smiles upon a second leave
aboard aboard for shame !
the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stay 'd for
there my blessing with thee !
and these few UNknown in thy memory see thou character
give thy thoughts no tongue nor any UNknown thought his act
be thou familiar but by no means vulgar
those friends thou hast and their adoption tried UNknown them to thy soul with UNknown of steel
of entrance to a quarrel but being in bear 't that the opposed may beware of thee
give every man thy ear but few thy voice take each man 's UNknown but reserve thy judgment
costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not express 'd in fancy !
rich not UNknown for the UNknown oft UNknown the man
neither a UNknown nor a lender be for loan oft loses both itself and friend
and borrowing UNknown the edge of UNknown
to thine UNknown be true
my blessing season this in thee !
most humbly do i take my leave my lord
and remember well what i have said to you
what is 't ophelia he hath said to you ?
so please you something touching the lord hamlet
tis told me he hath very oft of late
what is between you ?
give me up the truth
you speak like a green girl UNknown in such perilous circumstance
do you believe his UNknown as you call them ?
i do not know my lord what i should think
marry i UNknown l teach you
that you have ta UNknown n these UNknown for true pay which are not sterling
tender yourself more dearly or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase running it thus you UNknown l tender me a fool
my lord he hath UNknown me with love in honourable fashion
ay fashion you may call it go to go to
and hath given countenance to his speech my lord with almost all the holy vows of heaven
ay UNknown to catch UNknown
i do know when the blood burns how prodigal the soul
in few ophelia do not believe his vows
i would not in plain terms from this time forth have you so slander any moment leisure as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet
look to 't i charge you
i shall obey my lord
the air bites UNknown it is very cold
it is a UNknown and an eager air
i think it lacks of twelve
UNknown what does this mean my lord ?
the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse
keeps UNknown and the swaggering up spring reels
and as he drains his UNknown of UNknown down
the kettle drum and trumpet thus UNknown out
the triumph of his pledge
is it a custom ?
look my lord it comes !
angels and ministers of grace defend us !
be thou a spirit of health or UNknown damn 'd ?
bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell ?
be thy UNknown wicked or charitable thou UNknown in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee
i UNknown l call thee hamlet
let me not burst in ignorance but tell why thy UNknown bones UNknown in death have burst their UNknown
what should we do ?
it UNknown you to go away with it
as if it some UNknown did desire to you alone
it waves you to a more removed ground
but do not go with it
it will not speak then i will follow it
why what should be the fear ?
i do not set my life in a pin 's fee
and for my soul what can it do to that being a thing immortal as itself ?
go on i UNknown l follow thee
you shall not go my lord
hold off your hands !
be ruled you shall not go
my fate cries out and makes each petty artery in this body as hardy as the UNknown lion 's nerve
still am i call 'd
by heaven i UNknown l make a ghost of him that lets me !
go on i UNknown l follow thee
he UNknown desperate with imagination
to what issue will this come ?
something is rotten in the state of denmark
where wilt thou lead me ?
my hour is almost come when i to UNknown and tormenting flames must render up myself
pity me not but lend thy serious hearing to what i shall unfold
speak i am bound to hear
but that i am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house
i could a tale unfold whose UNknown word would UNknown up thy soul freeze thy young blood make thy two eyes like stars start from their UNknown
but this eternal UNknown must not be to ears of flesh and blood
list list o list !
if thou didst ever thy dear father love
as in the best it is but this most foul strange and unnatural
haste me to know 't that i with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love may sweep to my revenge
tis given out that sleeping in my orchard a serpent stung me
but know thou noble youth
the serpent that did sting thy father 's life now wears his crown
o my UNknown soul !
ay that UNknown that UNknown beast with witchcraft of his wit with UNknown gifts won to his shameful lust the will of my most seeming virtuous queen
o hamlet what a falling off was there !
from me whose love was of that dignity that it went hand in hand even with the vow
i made to her in marriage and to decline upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor to those of mine !
but lust though to a radiant angel link 'd will UNknown itself in a celestial bed and prey on garbage
methinks i scent the morning air
so did it mine and a most instant UNknown bark 'd about most lazar like with vile and loathsome crust all my smooth body
thus was i sleeping by a brother 's hand of life of crown and queen at once dispatch 'd
if thou hast nature in thee bear it not !
let not the royal bed of denmark be a couch for luxury and damned UNknown
but UNknown thou UNknown this act taint not thy mind nor let thy soul UNknown against thy mother aught
leave her to heaven and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge to prick and sting her
fare thee well at once !
the glow worm shows the UNknown to be near and UNknown ins to pale his UNknown fire
volce echoes remember me !
o all you host of heaven !
and shall i couple hell ?
and you my UNknown grow not instant old but bear me UNknown up
ay thou poor ghost while memory holds a seat in this distracted globe
yea from the table of my memory
i UNknown l wipe away all trivial fond records
all saws of books all forms all UNknown past that youth and observation copied there
and thy commandment all alone shall live within the book and volume of my brain UNknown 'd with UNknown matter
o most UNknown woman !
o villain villain smiling damned villain !
i 'm sure it may be so in denmark
so uncle there you are
my lord my lord !
UNknown ho ho my lord !
UNknown ho ho boy !
how is 't my noble lord ?
what news my lord ?
good my lord tell it
no you UNknown l reveal it
not i my lord by heaven
how say you then ?
would heart of man once think it ?
but you UNknown l be secret ?
ay by heaven my lord
there 's ne UNknown r a villain dwelling in all denmark but he 's an UNknown knave
there needs no ghost come from the grave to tell us this
why right you are i the right
and so without more circumstance at all i hold it fit that we shake hands and part
you as your business and desire shall point you for every man has business and desires such as it is and for mine own poor part
look you i UNknown l go pray
these are but wild and whirling words my lord
i 'm sorry they offend you heartily
there 's no offence my lord
yes by saint patrick but there is horatio and much offence too
touching this vision here it is an honest ghost that let me tell you for your desire to know what is between us
o UNknown UNknown 't as you may
and now good friends as you are friends scholars and soldiers give me one poor request
my lord we will not
in faith my lord not i
nor i my lord in faith
we have sworn my lord already
say 's t thou so ?
art thou there UNknown ?
come on you hear this fellow in the UNknown consent to swear
propose the oath my lord
then we UNknown l shift our ground
come hither gentlemen and lay your hands again upon my sword
never to speak of this that you have heard
well said old mole !
canst work i the earth so fast ?
once more remove good friends
o day and night but this is wondrous strange !
and therefore as a stranger give it welcome
there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in our philosophy
as well well we know or we could and if we would or such UNknown giving out to note that you know aught of me
this not to do so grace and mercy at your most need help you swear !
let us go in together ; and still your fingers on your lips i pray
the time is out of joint
that ever i was born to set it right !
give my son this money and these notes UNknown
you shall do marvellous wisely good UNknown before you visit him to make inquire of his behaviour
my lord i did intend it
take you as 't were some distant knowledge of him as thus i know his father and his friends
do you mark this UNknown ?
ay very well my lord
and in part him but you may say not well
but if 't be he i mean he 's very wild
as gaming my lord ?
ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling UNknown you may go so far
my lord that would UNknown him
faith no as you may season it in the charge
wherefore should you do this ?
ay my lord i would know that
good sir or so or friend or gentleman according to the phrase or the addition of man and country
what was i about to say ?
by the mass i was about to say something
where did i leave ?
at closes in the consequence
at closes in the consequence ?
he closes thus i know the gentleman
i saw him yesterday or t other day
or then or then with such or such
and as you say there was a gaming
there a falling out at tennis or perchance
i saw him enter such a house of sale
UNknown a brothel or so forth
see you now your bait of UNknown takes this carp of truth and thus do we of wisdom and of reach by UNknown find directions out
you have me have you not ?
god be wi you fare you well
observe his UNknown in yourself
and let him UNknown his music
what 's the matter ?
o my lord my lord i have been so UNknown !
with what i the name of god ?
mad for thy love ?
my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it
that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turn 'd he seem 'd to find his way without his eyes
this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property UNknown itself and leads the will to desperate UNknown
what have you given him any hard words of late ?
no my good lord but as you did command
i did repel his UNknown and denied his access to me
that hath made him mad
i am sorry that with better heed and judgment
i had not quoted him
i fear 'd he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee but UNknown my jealousy !
come go we to the king
welcome dear UNknown and UNknown !
moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending
something have you heard of hamlet 's transformation
both your majesties might by the sovereign power you have of us put your dread pleasures more into command than to UNknown
but we both obey and here give up ourselves in the full bent to lay our service freely at your feet to be commanded
thanks UNknown and gentle UNknown
thanks UNknown and gentle UNknown
and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changed son
go some of you and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is
heavens make our presence and our UNknown pleasant and helpful to him !
the ambassadors from norway my good lord are UNknown return 'd
thou still hast been the father of good news
have i my lord ?
i assure my good liege i hold my duty as i hold my soul both to my god and to my gracious king
and i do think that i have found the very cause of hamlet 's lunacy
o speak of that that do i long to hear
first give UNknown to the ambassadors my news shall be the fruit unto the feast
thyself do grace to them and bring them in
he tells me my sweet gertrude that he hath found the head and source of all your son 's UNknown
i doubt it is no other but the main his father 's death and our o UNknown UNknown marriage
say what from our brother norway ?
most fair return of greetings and desires
he sent out to suppress his nephew 's march
the which he thought proposed against the poles but better look 'd into he truly found it was against your highness and our state
at night we UNknown l feast together
this business is well ended
my liege and madam to UNknown what majesty should be what duty is why day is day night night and time is time
were nothing but to waste night day and time
therefore since UNknown is the soul of wit and UNknown the limbs and outward UNknown
mad call i it for to define true madness what is 't but to be nothing else but mad ?
more matter with less art
madam i swear i use no art at all
that he is mad 't is true tis true 't is pity and pity 't is 't is true a foolish figure
thus it remains and the remainder thus
i have a daughter have while she is mine who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this
to the celestial and my soul 's idol the most UNknown ophelia
that 's an ill phrase a vile phrase
in her excellent white bosom these
came this from hamlet to her ?
good madam stay awhile i will be faithful
doubt thou the stars are fire doubt that the sun doth move
doubt truth to be a liar but never doubt i love
this in obedience hath my daughter shown me and more above
but how hath she received his love ?
what do you think of me ?
as of a friend faithful and honourable
i would fain prove so
but what might you think
when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i UNknown it i must tell you that before my daughter told me what might you
or my dear majesty your queen here think
if i had given my heart a UNknown mute and dumb or look 'd upon this love with idle sight ?
no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did UNknown
lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star
and then i UNknown gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no UNknown
into the madness wherein now he UNknown and all we mourn for
do you think 't is this ?
it may be very likely
hath there been such a time i 'd fain know that that i have positively said tis so when it proved otherwise ?
take this from this if this be otherwise
if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the centre
how may we try this further ?
you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby
at such a time i UNknown l loose my daughter to him
be you and i behind an arras then mark the encounter
if he love her not
and be not from his reason fallen UNknown
let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and UNknown
but look where sadly the poor wretch comes
her father and myself lawful UNknown thus may of their encounter frankly judge if be the affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for
and for your part ophelia
i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlet 's UNknown
so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his UNknown way again to both your honours
madam i wish it may
read on this book that show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness
let 's withdraw my lord
to be or not to be that is the question
whether 't is nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles
and by opposing end them ?
to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heart ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to
tis a UNknown UNknown to be wish 'd
to sleep perchance to dream
ay there 's the rub
for in that sleep of death what dreams may come
when we have UNknown off this mortal coil must give us pause
there 's the respect that makes calamity of so long life
for who would bear the whips and UNknown of time but that the dread of something after death ?
the UNknown 'd country from whose UNknown no traveller returns puzzles the will
and makes us rather bear those UNknown we have than fly to others that we know not of ?
and lose the name of action
nymph in thy UNknown be all my sins remember 'd
good my lord how does your honour for this many a day ?
i humbly thank you well well well
my lord i have UNknown of yours that i have long ed long to re deliver
i pray you now receive them
not i i never gave you aught
mine honour 'd lord you know right well you did and with them words of so sweet breath composed as made the things more rich
their perfume lost take these again for to the noble mind rich gifts wax poor when UNknown prove unkind
what means your lordship ?
i did love you once
indeed my lord you made me believe so
you should not have believed me i loved you not
i was the more deceived
get thee to a UNknown
why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners ?
i am myself indifferent honest and yet i could accuse me of such things it were better my mother had not borne me
what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven ?
we are UNknown knaves all believe none of us
go thy ways to a UNknown
where 's your father ?
o help him you sweet heavens !
if thou dost marry i UNknown l give you this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape UNknown
get thee to a UNknown go farewell
or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them
o heavenly powers restore him !
you jig you UNknown and you UNknown and nick name god 's creatures and make your UNknown your ignorance
go to i UNknown l no more on 't it hath made me mad
i say we will have no more marriages
those that are married already all but one shall live the rest shall keep as they are
o what a noble mind is here o UNknown UNknown !
the UNknown 's soldier 's scholar 's eye tongue sword
the UNknown and rose of the fair state the glass of fashion and the mould of form the observed of all UNknown quite quite down !
and i of ladies most UNknown and wretched that suck 'd the honey of his music vows now see that noble and most sovereign reason
like sweet bells UNknown out of tune and harsh
that UNknown 'd form and feature of blown youth blasted with ecstasy
his affections do not that way tend
there 's something in his soul o UNknown r which his melancholy sits on brood and i do think the hatch and the disclose will be some danger
you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all
away i do beseech you here he comes
i UNknown l bore him presently
do you know me my lord ?
excellent well you are a UNknown
then i would you were so honest a man
ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand
that 's very true my lord
for if the sun breed UNknown in a dead dog being a god kissing carrion
have you a daughter ?
let her not walk in the sun
conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive
how say you by that ?
still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i was a UNknown
he is far gone far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much UNknown for love very near this
i UNknown l speak to him again
what is the matter my lord ?
i mean the matter that you read my lord
UNknown sir for the UNknown rogue says here that old men have grey beards
that their faces are wrinkled
their eyes UNknown thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a most UNknown lack of wit well together with most weak hams
all which sir though i most UNknown and UNknown believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down
for you yourself sir should be as old as i am if like a crab you could go backward
though this be madness yet there is method in 't
will you walk out of the air my lord ?
indeed that is out o the air
how pregnant sometimes his replies are !
my honourable lord i will most humbly take my leave of you
you cannot sir take from me anything that i would more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life
fare you well my lord
these tedious old fools !
you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is
god save you sir !
my most dear lord !
my excellent good friends !
how dost thou UNknown ?
good lads how do ye both ?
as the indifferent children of the earth
happy in that we are not over happy
on fortune 's cap we are not the very button
nor the soles of her shoe ?
then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours ?
in the secret parts of fortune ?
most true she is a strumpet
what 's the news ?
none my lord but that the world 's grown honest
then is doomsday near !
but your news is not true
let me question more in particular
what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither ?
then is the world one
a UNknown one in which there are many UNknown wards and dungeons
denmark being one o the worst
we think not so my lord
why then 't is none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so
to me it 's a prison
why then your ambition makes it one
i could be UNknown in a nut shell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams
shall we to the court ?
we UNknown l wait upon you
i will not sort you with the rest of my servants
but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at UNknown ?
to visit you my lord no other occasion
were you not sent for ?
is it your own UNknown ?
come deal justly with me
what should we say my lord ?
why anything but to the purpose
you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your UNknown have not craft enough to colour
i know the good king and queen have sent for you
to what end my lord ?
that you must teach me
but let me UNknown you by the rights of our fellowship be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no ?
nay then i have an eye of you
if you love me hold not off
my lord we were sent for
i will tell you why
so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen UNknown no feather
i have of late but wherefore i know not
UNknown all custom of exercise
what a piece of work is a man !
how noble in reason !
how infinite in faculty !
in form and moving how express and admirable !
in action how like an angel !
in UNknown how like a god !
the beauty of the world !
the UNknown of animals !
and yet to me what is this UNknown of dust ?
no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so
my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts
why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me ?
to think my lord if you delight not in man what UNknown entertainment the players shall receive from you
we UNknown them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service
what players are they ?
even those you were wont to take delight in the UNknown of the city
he that plays the king shall be welcome
UNknown there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out
car horn there are the players
gentlemen you are welcome to UNknown
my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived
in what my dear lord ?
i am but mad north north west
when the wind is UNknown i know an 'a UNknown from an 'a UNknown
well be with you gentlemen !
hark you UNknown and you too
at each ear a UNknown
that great baby you see there is not yet out of his UNknown UNknown
happily he 's the second time come to them for they say an old man is twice a child
i will UNknown he comes to tell me of the players mark it
you say right sir monday morning 't was so indeed
my lord i have news to tell you
my lord i have news to tell you !
when UNknown was an actor in rome
the actors are come hither my lord
then came each actor on his arse
the best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy history UNknown UNknown comical historical UNknown UNknown historical UNknown comical historical UNknown scene UNknown or poem unlimited
seneca cannot be too heavy nor UNknown too light
o UNknown judge of israel what a treasure UNknown thou !
what a treasure had he my lord ?
why one fair daughter and no more the which he loved passing well
am i not i the right old UNknown ?
if you call me UNknown my lord i have a daughter that i love passing well
what follows then my lord ?
you are welcome masters welcome all
i am glad to see thee well
o my old friend !
what my young lady and mistress !
by 'r lady your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when i last saw you
pray god your voice be not cracked within the ring
we UNknown l have a speech straight
come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech
what speech my lord ?
i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million
twas UNknown to the general
one speech in it i chiefly loved 't was UNknown tale to UNknown and UNknown of it especially where he speaks of priam 's slaughter
if it live in your memory begin at this line
let me see let me see
the rugged UNknown like the UNknown beast it is not so
it begins with UNknown the rugged UNknown
er black as his purpose did the night resemble
when he lay couch ed in the ominous horse
hath now this dread and black complexion smear 'd
with UNknown more dismal head to foot
total UNknown roasted in wrath
and thus o UNknown r sized with UNknown UNknown
anon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls UNknown to command
UNknown at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword his UNknown ed father falls
so as a painted tyrant UNknown stood
and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing
but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the UNknown below as hush as death
anon the dreadful thunder doth UNknown the region so after UNknown pause UNknown ed vengeance sets him new a work
and never did the cyclops hammers fall on mars his UNknown forged for proof UNknown with less remorse than UNknown bleeding sword now falls on priam
it shall to the barber 's with your beard
he 's for a jig or a tale of UNknown or he sleeps
o who had seen the UNknown queen ?
run barefoot up and down threatening the flames with UNknown UNknown a clout about that head where late the UNknown stood
and for a robe about her UNknown and all o UNknown r UNknown loins
a blanket in the alarm of fear caught up
who this had seen with tongue in venom steep 'd
look where he has not turned his colour and has tears in 's eyes
good my lord will you see the players well bestowed ?
do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstract and brief UNknown of the time
my lord i will use them according to their desert
god 's UNknown man much better !
we UNknown l hear a play tomorrow
dost thou hear me old friend ?
can you play the murder of UNknown ?
we UNknown l ha 't tomorrow night
you could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which i would set down and insert in 't could you not ?
my good friends i UNknown l leave you till night
you are welcome to UNknown
ay so god be wi ye
and all for nothing !
what 's UNknown to him or he to UNknown that he should weep for her ?
yet i a dull and muddy UNknown rascal peak
like john a 'd UNknown UNknown of my cause and can say nothing
no not for a king upon whose property and most dear life a damn 'd defeat was made
am i a coward ?
who calls me villain ?
breaks my UNknown across ?
UNknown off my beard and blows it in my face ?
UNknown me by the nose ?
gives me the lie i the throat as deep as to the lungs ?
UNknown i should take it for it cannot be but i am pigeon liver 'd and lack gall to make oppression bitter or ere this
i should have fatted all the region kites with this slave 's UNknown
UNknown treacherous UNknown UNknown villain !
why what an ass am i !
for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ
i UNknown l have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle
i UNknown l observe his looks i UNknown l tent him to the quick
the spirit that i have seen may be a devil and the devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape
yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits UNknown me to damn me
i UNknown l have grounds more relative than this
the play 's the thing wherein i UNknown l catch the conscience of the king
and can you by no drift of conference get from him why he puts on this confusion ?
he does confess he feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak
nor do we find him forward to be sounded but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state
did he receive you well ?
but with much forcing of his disposition
UNknown of question but of our demands most free in his reply
did you UNknown him ?
and he beseech 'd me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter
with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him thus inclined
good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights
i have in quick determination thus set it down
he shall with speed to england
UNknown the seas and countries different with UNknown objects will expel
this something settled matter in his heart UNknown his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself
what think you on 't ?
it shall do well but yet do i believe
the origin and UNknown of his grief sprung from neglected love
my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play
let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief
let her be round with him and i UNknown l be placed so please you in the ear
if she find him not to england send him or confine him where your wisdom best shall think
madness in great ones must not UNknown 'd go
speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to you UNknown on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of your players do
i would have such a fellow whipped for o UNknown UNknown UNknown
be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor
suit the action to the word the word to the action
i hope we have reformed that UNknown with us sir
that 's UNknown and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it
how now my lord !
will the king hear this piece of work ?
and the queen too and that presently
will you two help to hasten them ?
here sweet lord at your service
horatio thou art e UNknown n as just a man as e UNknown r my conversation UNknown withal
nay do not think i flatter
since my dear soul was mistress of her choice and could of men distinguish her election hath seal 'd thee for herself
give me that man that is not passion 's slave and i will wear him in my heart 's core ay in my heart of heart as i do thee
something too much of this
there is a play tonight before the king
one scene of it comes near the circumstance which i have told thee of my father 's death
i prithee when thou UNknown that act afoot even with the very comment of thy soul observe mine uncle
if his UNknown guilt do not itself UNknown in one speech it is a damned ghost that we have seen and my UNknown are as foul as UNknown 's smithy
they are coming to the play
hamlet whlstles along to muslc
how fares our cousin hamlet ?
excellent i faith of the UNknown 's dish i eat the air promise crammed
i have nothing with this answer hamlet these words are not mine
my lord you played once i the university you say ?
that did i my lord and was accounted a good actor
what did you UNknown ?
i did UNknown julius caesar
i was killed i the capitol
it was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there
be the players ready ?
ay my lord they stay upon your patience
come hither my dear hamlet sit by me
no good mother here 's metal more attractive
do you mark that ?
lady shall i lie in your lap ?
i mean my head upon your lap ?
do you think i meant country matters ?
i think nothing my lord
that 's a fair thought
to lie between maids legs
you are merry my lord
o god your only jig maker
what should a man do but be merry ?
for look how cheerfully my mother looks and my father died these two hours
nay 't is twice two months my lord
nay then let the devil wear black for i UNknown l have a suit of UNknown
what means this my lord ?
marry this is UNknown UNknown
UNknown this show UNknown the argument of the play
we shall know by this fellow the players cannot keep counsel
they UNknown l tell all
for us and for our tragedy
here UNknown to your clemency we beg your hearing patiently
is this a prologue or the UNknown of a ring ?
full 30 years hath passed in sacred UNknown since love our hearts and UNknown joined our hands
so many journeys may the sun and moon make us again count o UNknown r ere love be done !
faith i must leave thee love and shortly too
my UNknown powers their functions leave to do
and thou shalt live in this fair world behind honour 'd beloved and UNknown one as kind for husband shalt thou
o confound the rest !
such love must needs be treason in my breast
in second husband let me be UNknown !
none wed the second but who kill 'd the first
a second time i kill my husband dead when second husband kisses me in bed
i do believe you think what now you speak but what we do determine oft we break
so think thou wilt no second husband wed but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead
nor earth to me give food nor heaven light !
sport and repose lock from me day and night !
both here and hence pursue me lasting strife if once a widow ever i be wife !
if she should break it now !
sweet leave me here awhile
my spirits grow dull and fain i would UNknown the tedious day with sleep
sleep rock thy brain and never come UNknown between us twain !
madam how like you this play ?
o but she UNknown l keep her word
have you heard the argument ?
is there no offence in 't ?
no no they do but jest poison in jest
no offence i the world
what do you call the play ?
the play is the image of a murder done in vienna
UNknown is the duke 's name his wife UNknown
't is a UNknown piece of work but what o that ?
your majesty and we that have free souls it touches us not
let the gall ed jade UNknown our withers are UNknown
ah this is one UNknown nephew to the king
you are as good as a chorus my lord
i could interpret between you and your love if i could see the puppets UNknown
pox leave thy UNknown faces and begin
come the UNknown raven doth UNknown for revenge
thoughts black hands apt drugs fit and time agreeing
confederate season else no creature seeing
thou mixture rank of midnight weeds collected with UNknown 's ban thrice blasted thrice infected
thy natural magic and dire property on wholesome life UNknown immediately
he poisons him in the garden for his estate
the play is UNknown and writ in choice italian
you shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of UNknown 's wife
what UNknown with false fire ?
how fares my lord ?
give o UNknown r the play
o good horatio i UNknown l take the ghost 's word for a thousand pound
upon the talk of the poisoning ?
i did very well note him
for if the king like not the comedy why then UNknown he like it not perdy
good my lord UNknown me a word with you
ay sir what of him ?
is in his retirement marvellous UNknown
no my lord rather with UNknown
good my lord put your discourse into some frame and start not so wildly from my affair
the queen your mother in most great affliction of spirit hath sent me to you
if it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer i will do your mother 's commandment
oh oh oh sir i cannot
make you a wholesome answer
my mother you say ?
then thus she says your behavior hath struck her into wonder and UNknown
she desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed
we shall obey were she ten times our mother
have you any further trade with us ?
my lord you once did love me
so i do still by these pickers and UNknown
good my lord what is your cause of UNknown ?
you do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your UNknown to your friend
how can that be when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in denmark ?
ay but sir while the grass grows
the proverb is something musty
why do you go about to recover the wind of me as if you would drive me into a toil ?
o my lord if my duty be too bold my love is too UNknown
i do not well understand that
will you play upon this pipe ?
i know no touch of it my lord
tis as easy as lying
govern these UNknown with your fingers and thumb give it breath with your mouth and it will discourse most eloquent music
look you these are the stops
but these cannot i command to any UNknown of harmony
i have not the skill
why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of me !
you would play upon me
you would seem to know my stops
UNknown do you think i am easier to be played on than a pipe ?
call me what instrument you will though you can fret me
you cannot play upon me
god bless you sir !
my lord the queen would speak with you
they play UNknown and presently !
do you see yonder cloud that 's almost in shape of a camel ?
by the mass and 't is like a camel indeed
methinks it is like a weasel
it is backed like a weasel
or like a whale ?
then i will come to my mother by and by
they fool me to the top of my bent
i will come by and by
by and by is easily said !
hamlet plays three UNknown UNknown
tis now the very UNknown time of night when UNknown yawn and hell itself breathes out UNknown to this world
i will speak daggers to her but use none
i like him not nor stands it safe with us to let his madness range
i your commission will forthwith dispatch and he to england shall along with you
the terms of our estate may not endure hazard so dangerous as doth UNknown grow out of his lunacy
most holy and religious fear it is to keep those many many bodies safe that live and feed upon your majesty
never alone did the king sigh but with a general groan
for majesty is like a UNknown wheel fix 'd on the summit of the highest mount to whose huge UNknown 10 000 lesser things are UNknown and UNknown 'd
arm you i pray you to this speedy voyage for we will UNknown put upon this fear which now goes too free footed
my lord he 's going to his mother 's closet
behind the arras i UNknown l convey myself to hear the process i UNknown l warrant she UNknown l tax him home
fare you well my liege
i UNknown l call upon you ere you go to bed and tell you what i know
o my offence is rank
it hath the UNknown eldest curse upon 't a brother 's murder
pray can i not though inclination be as sharp as will my stronger guilt UNknown my strong intent
and like a man to double business bound
i stand in pause where i shall first begin and both neglect
what if this UNknown ed hand were thicker than itself with brother 's blood ?
is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens to wash it white as snow ?
UNknown serves mercy but to confront the UNknown of offence ?
and what 's in prayer but this two fold force to be UNknown ere we come to fall or pardon 'd being down ?
then i UNknown l look up
but o what form of prayer can serve my turn ?
forgive me my foul murder ?
that cannot be since i am still possess 'd of those effects for which i did the murder my crown mine own ambition and my queen
there the action lies in his true nature and we ourselves UNknown 'd even to the teeth and forehead of our faults to give in evidence
o what can it not ?
but what can it when one cannot repent ?
o bosom black as death !
o lime ed soul that struggling to be free art more engaged !
bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel be soft as UNknown of the newborn babe
now might i do it pat
and now i UNknown l do 't !
and so he goes to heaven and so am i UNknown
that would be UNknown 'd
a villain kills my father and for that
i his sole son do this same villain send to heaven ?
o this is hire and salary not revenge
he took my father UNknown full of bread with all his crimes broad blown as flush as may
and how his UNknown stands who knows save heaven ?
then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven and that his soul may be as damn 'd and black as hell UNknown it goes
this UNknown but UNknown thy sickly days
my words fly up my thoughts remain below
words without thoughts never to heaven go
look you lay home to him
tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with
and that your grace hath screen 'd and stood between
i UNknown l silence me even here
pray you be round with him
i UNknown l warrant you fear me not
now mother what 's the matter ?
hamlet thou hast thy father much offended
mother you have my father much offended
come come you answer with an idle tongue
go go you question with a wicked tongue
why how now hamlet !
what 's the matter now ?
have you forgot me ?
no by the UNknown not so
you are the queen your husband 's brother 's wife and would it were not so ! you are my mother
nay then i UNknown l set those to you that can speak
come come and sit you down you shall not budge
you go not till i set you up a glass where you may see the UNknown part of you
what wilt thou do ?
thou wilt not murder me !
what hast thou done ?
is it the king ?
o what a rash and bloody deed is this !
almost as bad good mother as kill a king and marry with his brother
as kill a king !
ay lady 't was my word
thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell !
i took thee for thy better
sit you down and let me wring your heart for so i shall if it be made of UNknown stuff
what have i done that thou UNknown wag thy tongue in noise so rude against me ?
that UNknown the grace and blush of modesty
calls virtue hypocrite makes marriage vows as false as UNknown oaths
ay me what act that roars so loud and UNknown in the index ?
look here upon this picture and on this
the counterfeit UNknown of two brothers
see what a grace was seated on this brow
UNknown 's curls the front of jove himself
look you now what follows
here is your husband like a UNknown 'd ear blasting his wholesome brother
what devil was 't that thus hath UNknown 'd you at UNknown blind ?
eyes without feeling feeling without sight ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all or but a sickly part of one true sense
where is thy blush ?
o hamlet speak no more
thou turn 's t mine eyes into my very soul and there i see such black and grain ed spots as will not leave their UNknown
nay but to live in the rank sweat of an UNknown ed bed stew 'd in corruption UNknown and making love over the nasty sty
o speak to me no more !
these words like daggers enter in mine ears
no more sweet hamlet !
a murderer and a villain
a slave that is not twentieth part the UNknown of your precedent lord
a vice of kings a UNknown of the empire and the rule who from a shelf the precious UNknown stole and put it in his pocket !
save me and UNknown o UNknown r me with your wings you heavenly guards !
what would your gracious figure ?
alas he 's mad !
do you not come your UNknown son to UNknown that UNknown in time and passion lets go by the important acting of your dread command ?
do not forget this UNknown is but to whet thy almost UNknown purpose
but look UNknown on thy mother sits
o step between her and her fighting soul
conceit in weakest bodies strongest works
how is it with you lady ?
alas how is 't with you that you do bend your eye on vacancy and with the UNknown air do hold discourse ?
forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep
o gentle son upon the heat and flame of thy UNknown sprinkle cool patience
UNknown do you look ?
on him on him !
how pale he UNknown !
do not look upon me
lest with this UNknown action you convert my stern effects
then what i have to do will want true colour tears perchance for blood
to whom do you speak this ?
do you see nothing there ?
nothing at all yet all there is i see
nor did you nothing hear ?
why look you now !
look how it steals away !
my father in his habit as he lived !
look where he goes even now out at the portal !
this is the very UNknown of your brain
my pulse as yours doth UNknown keep time and makes as UNknown music
it is not madness that i have utter 'd
bring me to the test
i the matter will re word which madness would UNknown from
mother for love of grace
lay not that flattering UNknown to your soul that not your trespass but my madness speaks
it will but skin and film the UNknown place whilst rank corruption mining all within UNknown unseen
confess yourself to heaven repent what 's past avoid what is to come and do not spread the UNknown on the weeds to make them UNknown
o hamlet thou hast UNknown my heart in twain
o throw away the UNknown part of it and live the UNknown with the other half
good night but go not to mine uncle 's bed
assume a virtue if you have it not
refrain tonight and that shall lend a kind of UNknown to the next UNknown
and when you are UNknown to be bless 'd
i UNknown l blessing beg of you
i do repent but heaven hath pleased it so to punish me with this and this with me that i must be their scourge and minister
i will bestow him and will answer well the death i gave him
i must be cruel only to be kind
thus bad begins and worse remains behind
one more word good lady
what shall i do ?
not this by no means that i bid you do
i must to england you know that ?
for 't is the sport to have the engineer hoist with his own UNknown and 't shall go hard
but i will UNknown one yard below their mines and blow them at the moon
o 't is most sweet when in one line two UNknown directly meet
this man shall set me packing
i UNknown l lug the guts into the neighbour room
indeed this counsellor is now most still most secret and most grave who was in life a foolish UNknown knave
come sir to draw toward an end with you
there 's matter in these sighs these profound UNknown
tis fit we understand them
where is your son ?
ah my good lord what have i seen tonight !
mad as the sea and wind when both contend which is the UNknown
in his lawless fit behind the mirror hearing something stir whips out his weapon cries a rat a rat !
and in this UNknown UNknown kills the unseen good old man
it had been so with us had we been there
his liberty is full of threats to all
to you yourself to us to every one
alas how will this bloody deed be answer 'd ?
it will be laid to us whose providence should have kept short restrain 'd and out of haunt this mad young man
but so much was our love we could not understand what was most fit
but like the owner of a foul disease to keep it from UNknown let it feed even on the UNknown of life
where is he gone ?
to draw apart the body he hath kill 'd o UNknown r whom his madness UNknown for what is done
the sun no sooner shall the mountains touch but we will ship him hence
friends both go join you with some further aid
hamlet in madness hath UNknown slain and from his mother 's closet hath he UNknown 'd him
speak fair and bring the body into the chapel
i pray you make haste
what have you done my lord with the dead body ?
UNknown it with dust UNknown 't is kin
tell us where 't is that we may take it thence and bear it to the chapel
that i can keep your counsel and not mine own
besides to be demanded of a sponge !
what UNknown should be made by the son of a king ?
take you me for a sponge my lord ?
ay sir that UNknown up the king 's countenance his rewards his authorities
but such officers do the king best service in the end
like an ape an apple in the corner of his jaw
first mouthed to be last swallowed when he needs what you have UNknown it is but squeezing you and sponge you shall be dry again
i understand you not my lord
i am glad of it
a UNknown speech sleeps in a foolish ear
my lord you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the king
the body is with the king but the king is not with the body
the king is a thing
hide fox and all after
i have sent to seek him and to find the body
how dangerous is it that this man goes loose !
yet must not we put the strong law on him
he 's loved of the distracted multitude who like not in their judgment but their eyes
and where tis so the offender 's scourge is weigh 'd but never the offence
to bear all smooth and even this sudden sending him away must seem deliberate cause
diseases desperate grown by desperate measure are relieved or not at all
how now ! what hath befall 'n ?
where the dead body is bestow 'd my lord we cannot get from him
but where is he ?
without my lord guarded to know your pleasure
not where he eats but where he is eaten
a certain UNknown of UNknown worms are e UNknown n at him
your worm is your only emperor for diet
we fat all creatures else to fat ourselves we fat ourselves for UNknown
a man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm
what dost you mean by this ?
nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar
if your messenger find him not there seek him i the other place yourself
but indeed if you find him not within this month you shall nose him as you go upstairs into the lobby
he will stay till ye come
hamlet this deed for thine UNknown safety which we do tender as we dearly grieve for that which thou hast done must send thee hence with fiery UNknown
the bark is ready and the wind at help the associates tend and everything is bent for england
so is it if thou knew 's t our purposes
i see a UNknown that sees them
my mother father and mother is man and wife man and wife is one flesh and so my mother
tempt him with speed aboard
i UNknown l have him hence tonight
and england if my love thou hold 's t at aught thou UNknown not UNknown set our sovereign purpose
the present death of hamlet
do it england for like the hectic in my blood he UNknown and thou must cure me
till i know 't is done UNknown UNknown r may hap my joys were ne UNknown r begun
i will not speak with her
she is UNknown indeed distract
her mood will needs be pitied
what would she have ?
she speaks much of her father says she hears there 's tricks i the world speaks things in doubt that carry but half sense
her speech is nothing yet the UNknown use of it doth move the UNknown to collection
UNknown good she was spoken with for she may UNknown dangerous UNknown in ill breeding minds
to my sick soul as sin 's true nature is each toy seems prologue to some great amiss
so full of UNknown jealousy is guilt it spills itself in fearing to be spilt
where is the UNknown majesty of denmark ?
how should your true love know
by his UNknown hat and staff
alas sweet lady what UNknown this song ?
he is dead and gone lady
he is dead and gone
at his head a grass green turf
at his heels a stone
white his shroud as the mountain snow
which UNknown to the grave did not go
how do you pretty lady ?
well god 'i ld you !
they say the owl was a baker 's daughter
o lord we know what we are but know not what we may be
god be at your table !
pray you let 's have no words of this
but when they ask you what it means say you this
tomorrow is saint valentine 's day
all in the morning UNknown
and i a maid at your window
then up he rose and UNknown 'd his clothes
and UNknown 'd the chamber door
let in the maid that out a maid never departed more
i UNknown l make an end on 't
by UNknown and by saint charity
alack and fie for shame !
young men will do 't if they come to 't
by cock they are to blame
UNknown she before you UNknown me
you promised me to wed
so would i ha done by yonder sun
an thou UNknown not come to my bed
how long hath she been thus ?
i hope all will be well
we must be patient but i cannot choose but weep to think they should lay him i the cold ground
my brother shall know of it and so i thank you for your good counsel
good night ladies good night sweet ladies good night good night
give her good watch i pray you
o this is the poison of deep grief
it springs all from her father 's death and now behold
when sorrows come they come not single spies but in battalions
next your son gone and he most violent author of his own just remove
the people UNknown sick and UNknown in their thoughts and whispers for good UNknown death and we have done but UNknown in UNknown UNknown thus to UNknown him
alas what noise is this ?
where are my UNknown ?
bid them guard the door
laertes in a UNknown head o UNknown UNknown your officers
the rabble call him lord
they cry choose we laertes shall be king
caps hands and tongues applaud it to the clouds
laertes shall be king laertes king !
how cheerfully on the false trail they cry !
o this is counter you false danish dogs !
banglng the doors are broken
o vile king give me my father !
that drop of blood that 's calm UNknown me bastard
what is the cause laertes that thy rebellion looks so giant like ?
do not fear our person
there is such divinity doth hedge a king that treason can but peep to what it would acts little of his will
tell me laertes why art thou thus UNknown
let him demand his fill
how came he dead ?
i UNknown l not be UNknown with
vows to the UNknown devil !
conscience and grace to the UNknown pit !
to this point i stand let come what comes only i UNknown l be UNknown most thoroughly for my father
who shall stay you ?
will you know them then ?
to his good friends thus wide i UNknown l UNknown my arms and like the kind life UNknown pelican UNknown them with my blood
why now you speak like a good child and a true gentleman
that i am UNknown of your dear father 's death and am most sensibly in grief for it
it shall as level to your judgment pierce as day does to your eye
what noise is that ?
o heat dry up my brains !
tears seven times salt burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye !
o rose of may !
dear maid kind sister sweet ophelia !
is 't possible a young maid 's wits should be as mortal as an old man 's life ?
they bore him UNknown on the UNknown
hey UNknown UNknown UNknown no
and in his grave rain 'd many a tear
fare you well my dove !
UNknown thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge it could not move thus
you must sing a down a down an you call him a down this nothing 's more than matter
there 's rosemary that 's for remembrance
a document in madness thoughts and remembrance fitted
there 's UNknown for you and UNknown
there 's rue for you and here 's some for me
we may call it herb grace o sundays
o you must wear your rue with a difference
i would give you some violets but they withered all when my father died
they say he made a good end
for bonny sweet robin is all my joy
thought and affliction passion hell itself she turns to favour and to UNknown
and will he not come again ?
and will he not come again ?
no no he is dead
go to thy death bed
he never will come again
his beard was as white as snow
all UNknown was his poll
he is gone he is gone
and we cast away moan
god ha mercy on his soul !
and of all christian souls i pray god
i must commune with your grief or you deny me right
but if not be you content to lend your patience to us and we will UNknown labour with your soul to give it due content
and where the offence is
let the great axe fall
go captain from me greet the danish king
tell him that by his licence UNknown UNknown the UNknown of a promised march over his kingdom
i will do so my lord
sir whose powers are these ?
they are of norway sir
how UNknown sir i pray you ?
against some part of poland
who commands them sir ?
the nephew to old norway UNknown
goes it against the main of poland sir or for some frontier ?
truly to speak and with no addition we go to gain a little patch of ground that hath in it no profit but the name
to pay five ducats five i would not farm it
why then the polack never will defend it
yes it is already garrison 'd
two thousand souls and 20 000 ducats will not debate the question of this straw
i humbly thank you sir
god be wi you sir
how all occasions do inform against me and spur my dull revenge
i do not know why yet i live to say this thing 's to do
UNknown i have cause and will and strength and means to do 't
examples gross as earth UNknown me
even for an egg shell
o from this time forth
my thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth !
laertes was your father dear to you ?
or are you but the painting of a sorrow a face without a heart ?
why ask you this ?
what will you undertake to prove yourself your father 's son in deed more than in words ?
to cut his throat i the church
no place indeed should murder UNknown
revenge should know no bounds
but good laertes will you do this stay close within your chamber
hamlet return 'd shall know you are come home
let 's further think on this
if this should fail and that our drift look through our bad performance
UNknown better not UNknown 'd
when in your motion you are hot and dry as make your bout more violent to that end and that he calls for drink
i UNknown l have prepared him a chalice for the UNknown UNknown but UNknown if by chance he escape your venom 'd stuck our purpose will hold there
how now sweet queen ?
one woe doth tread upon another 's heel so fast they follow
your sister 's drown 'd laertes
pull 'd the poor wretch from her UNknown lay to muddy death
too much of water hast thou poor ophelia and therefore
i forbid my tears but yet
it is our trick nature her custom holds let shame say what it will
i have a speech of fire that fain would blaze but that this folly UNknown it
how much i had to do to calm his rage
now fear i this will give it start again
is she to be buried in christian burial that UNknown seeks her own salvation ?
i tell thee she is
and therefore make her grave straight
well how can that be unless she drowned herself in her own defence ?
why 't is found so
it must be se UNknown it cannot be else
for here lies the point
if i drown myself UNknown it UNknown an act
and an act hath three branches
it is to act to do to perform
UNknown she drowned herself UNknown
nay but hear you goodman UNknown
here lies the water good
here stands the man good
if the man go to this water and drown himself it is will he UNknown he he goes mark you that
but if the water come to him and drown him he drowns not himself
UNknown he that is not guilty of his own death UNknown not his own life
UNknown thy brains no more about it
go get thee to UNknown
fetch me a UNknown of liquor
in youth when i did love did love
methought it was very sweet
has this fellow no feeling of his business that he sings at grave making ?
custom hath made it in him a property of UNknown
tis e UNknown n so
that skull had a tongue in it and could sing once
how the knave UNknown it to the ground as if it were cain 's jaw bone that did the first murder !
it might be the UNknown of a politician one that would UNknown god might it not ?
and now my lady worm 's UNknown and knocked about the UNknown with a UNknown 's spade
here 's fine revolution an we had the trick to see 't
why may not that be the skull of a lawyer ?
where be his UNknown now his UNknown his tricks ?
i UNknown l speak to this fellow
o a pit of clay for to be made
for such a guest is meet
i think it be thine indeed for thou UNknown in 't
thou lie out of it sir and therefore it is not yours
for my part i do not lie in 't and yet it is mine
thou dost lie in 't to be in 't and say it is thine
tis for the dead not for the quick therefore thou UNknown
tis a quick lie sir UNknown away gain from me to you
what man dost thou dig it for ?
who is to be buried in 't ?
one that was a woman sir but rest her soul she 's dead
how absolute the knave is !
how long hast thou been a grave maker ?
of all the days i the year i came to 't that day that our last king hamlet UNknown UNknown
how long is that since ?
cannot you tell that ?
every fool can tell that
it was the very day that young hamlet was born he that is mad and sent into england
ay marry why was he sent into england ?
why because he was mad
UNknown a not be seen in him there
there the men are as mad as he
how came he mad ?
faith e UNknown n with losing his wits
i have been UNknown here man and boy 30 years
a tanner will last you nine year
here 's a skull sir
i UNknown e lain you in the earth three and 20 years
a UNknown mad fellow he was
whose do you think it was ?
a pestilence on him for a mad rogue !
he poured a UNknown of UNknown on my head once
a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy
he hath borne me on his back a thousand times and now how UNknown in my imagination it is !
my gorge rises at it
here hung those lips that i have kissed
i know not how oft
where be your UNknown now ?
your flashes of UNknown that were wont to set the table on a roar ?
not one now to mock your own grinning
now get you to my lady 's chamber and tell her
let her paint an inch thick to this favour she must come
make her laugh at that
prithee horatio tell me one thing
what 's that my lord ?
dost thou think alexander looked o this fashion i the earth ?
e UNknown n so my lord
UNknown caesar dead and turn 'd to clay
might stop a hole to keep the wind away
UNknown to consider too curiously to consider so
who is this they follow ?
and with such UNknown rites this doth UNknown the UNknown they follow did with desperate hand UNknown its own life
couch we awhile and mark
her UNknown have been as far enlarged as we have UNknown
and but that great command o UNknown UNknown the order she should in ground UNknown have lodged till the last trumpet
must there no more be done ?
we should UNknown the service of the dead to sing a UNknown and such rest to her as to peace parted souls
lay her i the earth
and from her fair and UNknown flesh may violets spring !
i tell thee UNknown priest a UNknown angel shall my sister be when thou UNknown howling
what the fair ophelia !
i hoped thou UNknown have been my hamlet 's wife
i thought thy bride bed to have deck 'd sweet maid not have UNknown 'd thy grave
o UNknown woe fall ten times UNknown on that cursed head whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense deprived thee of
hold off the earth awhile
what is he whose grief bears such an UNknown ?
whose phrase of sorrow UNknown the wandering stars and makes them stand like wonder wounded UNknown ?
the devil take thy soul !
thou pray 's t not well
i prithee take thy fingers from my throat
for though i am not UNknown and rash yet have i something in me dangerous which let thy UNknown fear
hold off thy hand !
good my lord be quiet
why i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer wag
o my son what theme ?
forty thousand brothers could not with all their quantity of love make up my sum
what wilt thou do for her ?
o he is mad laertes
for love of god UNknown him
UNknown show me what thou 'i t do
woo 't tear thyself ?
woo 't drink up UNknown ?
i UNknown l do 't
dost thou come here to whine ?
to UNknown me with leaping in her grave ?
be buried quick with her and so will i
and if thou UNknown of mountains let them throw millions of acres on us till our ground UNknown his UNknown against the burning zone make UNknown like a UNknown !
nay an thou 'i t mouth i UNknown l UNknown as well as thou
and thus awhile the fit will work on him
anon his silence will sit UNknown
what is the reason that you use me thus ?
but it is no matter
let hercules himself do what he may the cat will UNknown and dog will have his day
good horatio wait upon him
strengthen your patience in our last night 's speech
we UNknown l put the matter to the present push
good gertrude set some watch over your son
there 's a divinity that shapes our ends rough UNknown them how we will
UNknown and UNknown are dead
why man they did make love to this employment they are not near my conscience
why what a king is this !
but i am very sorry good horatio that to laertes i forgot myself
for by the image of my cause i see the UNknown of his
i UNknown l court his favours
but sure the bravery of his grief did put me into a UNknown passion
peace ! who comes here ?
your lordship is right welcome back to denmark
i humbly thank you sir
dost know this water fly ?
thy state is the more gracious for 't is a vice to know him
sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure i should UNknown a thing to you from his majesty
i will receive it sir with all UNknown of spirit
put your bonnet to his right use 't is for the head
i thank your lordship it is very hot
no believe me 't is very cold
it is indifferent cold my lord indeed
but yet methinks it is very UNknown and hot for my complexion
exceedingly my lord it is very UNknown as 't were i cannot tell how
but my lord his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head
sir this is the matter
nay good my lord for mine ease in good faith
sir here is newly come to court laertes believe me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent differences of very soft society and great showing
indeed to speak UNknown of him he is the card or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see
what UNknown the nomination of this gentleman ?
i know you are not ignorant
i would you did sir
yet in faith if you did it would not much approve me
you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is
i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself
i mean sir for his weapon
but in the UNknown laid on him by them in his UNknown he 's UNknown
what 's his weapon ?
three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very responsive to the UNknown most delicate carriages and of very liberal conceit
what call you the carriages ?
why is this UNknown as you call it ?
the king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him he shall not exceed you three hits
it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would UNknown the answer
how if i answer no ?
i mean sir the opposition of your person in trial
sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty
tis the breathing time of day with me i will win for him an i can if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits
shall i re deliver you e UNknown n so ?
to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will
this UNknown runs away with the shell on his head
he did comply with his mother 's dug before he sucked it
you will lose this wager my lord
i do not think so
since he went into france i have been in UNknown practise
i shall win at the odds
but thou wouldst not think how ill all 's here about my heart
but it is no matter
if your mind dislike any thing obey it
i will UNknown their repair hither and say you are not fit
there 's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow
if it be now 't is not to come
if it be not to come it will be now
if it be not now yet it will come
come hamlet come and take this hand from me
give me your pardon sir
i UNknown e done you wrong
but pardon 't as you are a gentleman
this presence knows and you must needs have heard how i am punish 'd with sore distraction
i do receive your offer 'd love like love and will not wrong it
i do embrace it freely
and will this brother 's wager frankly play
i UNknown l be your UNknown laertes in mine ignorance
your skill shall like a star i the darkest night stick fiery off indeed
give them the UNknown young UNknown
cousin hamlet you know the wager ?
your grace hath laid the odds o the weaker side
i do not think it
i have seen you both
but since he is better 'd we have therefore odds
this is too heavy let me see another
this likes me well enough
these UNknown have all a length ?
if hamlet give the first or second hit or quit in answer of the third exchange
let all the UNknown their ordnance fire
the king shall drink to hamlet 's better breath
and you the judge bear a wary eye
hamlet this pearl is thine
here 's to thy health
i UNknown l play this bout first set it by awhile
another hit what say you ?
a touch a touch i do confess
he 's hot and UNknown of breath
here hamlet take my napkin rub thy UNknown
the queen UNknown to thy fortune hamlet
i pray you pardon me
it is the poison 'd cup
i dare not drink yet madam by and by
come let me wipe thy face
my lord i UNknown l hit him now
i do not think 't
and yet tis almost UNknown UNknown my conscience
come for the third laertes you but dally
i pray you pass with your best violence
i am UNknown you make a wanton of me
have at you now !
my lord my lord !
they bleed on both sides
how is it my lord ?
how is 't laertes ?
why as a UNknown to mine own UNknown UNknown i am justly kill 'd with mine own treachery
how does the queen ?
she UNknown to see them bleed
no no the drink the drink
the drink the drink !
no medicine in the world can do thee good in thee there is not half an hour of life
the treacherous instrument is in thy hand UNknown and UNknown 'd
the foul practise hath turn 'd itself on me
lo here i lie never to rise again
thy mother 's poison 'd
the king the king 's to blame
o yet defend me friends
thou UNknown murderous damned dane
is thy union here ?
he is justly served it is a poison temper 'd by himself
exchange forgiveness with me noble hamlet
mine and my father 's death come not upon thee
heaven make thee free of it !
o i could tell you
report me and my cause UNknown to the UNknown
i am more an antique roman than a dane
here 's yet some liquor left
by heaven i UNknown l have 't
o good horatio what a wounded name
things standing thus unknown shall live behind me !
if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
now cracks a noble heart
good night sweet prince and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
that is not cool !
thank you for coming tonight darwin
this room is secure so we can speak freely
because the feds are coming tomorrow to shut us down
and there 's only one way we can save this department and that 's prove ourselves in the field
our target is leonard saber
as you know he is a former arms dealer and current UNknown of UNknown industries
the bureau 's intel shows saber has developed a new UNknown with possible military applications
they suspect he has sold his technology to the far east under the code name UNknown
now darwin we need to find out how saber plans to use this technology
your mission is to UNknown the UNknown files from saber 's personal computer located in his library right here
ben we 'r e gonna get you that evidence
we UNknown l prove once and for all what we can do
we UNknown l give UNknown m no choice
they UNknown l have to keep the program and make us special agents
look i believe in you but ifwe fail we blow a case they UNknown e been trying to crack for two years
hey i 'm nine inches tall
i only see the upside
tick UNknown we 'r e on the clock
i have a visual on saber
he 's wearing a 6 000 suit 50 000 watch and according to my UNknown scope UNknown size 36 UNknown UNknown
saber 's about to start his speech
remember the clock is ticking dude
we 'r e ten seconds ahead of schedule because blaster is a little UNknown up
this is what i live for
time to get this party started
talk to me do we have any activity ?
ok we 'r e clear
darwin you 'r e behind schedule
first mission jitters i guess
do you want to UNknown ?
no no it 's ok
i UNknown e been trained to do this
there 's a civilian passing through the perimeter
what are you looking at ?
the fly is in the ointment
darwin do you copy ?
what 's your twenty ?
i 'm in the morgue
don 't you wish your blowtorch was hot like mine
good thing i took shop
you 'r e not here for the sweets
for years we UNknown e been putting a secret into the heart of every member of the UNknown family be it the UNknown refrigerator or the new UNknown heated UNknown
on your mark get set go !
darwin the table 's set
you are clear to UNknown saber 's study
now in addition UNknown will link every old and new UNknown UNknown in existence and create one big family !
and nothing will be the same
why did they put the q so far away from the o ?
so what about it UNknown ?
because he 's so so not interested in me
keep the UNknown line clear please
ok UNknown i think i found it
thank you and good night
mooch give me an UNknown
UNknown i 'm going upstairs for a drink
darwin saber 's heading up
i 'm into the UNknown file
UNknown are you seeing this ?
this isn 't about selling weapons
it 's about global UNknown
you have to stop saber
UNknown you 'r e a genius !
i got a thing for worms
get out of there now !
the chimney will block the signal
come on baby come on
if he doesn 't make it are you free thursday night ?
he UNknown l make it
your butt 's on fire !
stop drop and roll !
i UNknown l be waiting at the entrance of the
we leave no UNknown behind
i 'm going after the dog !
there 's no time for thinking
i UNknown l rescue UNknown
oh did you see that ?
you get him girl !
we 'r e out of here
let 's check it out
by the way in case you missed it i just saved your fuzzy behind
we should celebrate over dinner
that was a little heavy on the smoke ben
yo UNknown did you catch the little leg twitch at the end of my death ?
tell me you are not part possum
ok you can laugh now but some of those people back there were crying
how 'd it go in there guys ?
the game 's over for saber
our training finally paid off
i knew you could do this
i figured we need a name
feds won 't be able to shut us down with this evidence
i think you look nice
how much longer UNknown ?
just a few more touches to UNknown saber 's UNknown system
to access the information on darwin 's UNknown
hey do i look fat in this ?
i haven 't worn a jacket since the prom
because he 's so not interested
what does that mean ?
men are like government bonds
they take way too long to mature
i heard over the wire that you 'r e interested
that 's not what you told blaster
don 't you get it ?
i want him interested in me
and he UNknown l only be interested if he thinks i 'm not
because you know you could have me which makes you not interested and that means i wouldn 't be interested in you even if i were
ok everybody they 'r e here
g force in your positions
congratulations on becoming the new task force director
let 's save the UNknown
many people don 't know that since the civil war animals have been used to gather strategic intelligence
now our work UNknown on developing communication between humans and animals
dr kendall do you mean to tell me that homeland security is financing a UNknown motel ?
how would i know that ?
so you UNknown l notice the extremely developed sense of motor skills
that 's because their brains have close to a billion UNknown and a UNknown UNknown
that 's a thousand times stronger than any UNknown
it gives them exceptional like eye hand reflexes
and there 's something over here
ok we UNknown l go over here
you 'r e really gonna be amazed by this
it 's a language UNknown
it UNknown animals to talk to humans
without it they sound like normal animals
go ahead take a look
you 'r e doctor UNknown
talking to animals is the easy part
so these guys are special agents ?
yeah just like we 'r e gonna be
hey how you doing ?
finding something that fits me off the rack that 's impossible
think that 's something ?
he 's been UNknown the file
he 's lucky i found him
last night g force was able to get some intelligence regarding project UNknown
we went to saber 's mansion and
wait a second you broke into leonard saber 's house ?
we accomplished in one night what you guys couldn 't do in two years
i knew we were up for review and i wanted to show you what we could do
all right then show me
what 'd you get ?
UNknown you 'r e on
darwin 's UNknown contains classified
i downloaded the UNknown file not plans for a coffee machine
UNknown show them the UNknown file
well this is all we have
no that 's not it !
it 's about global UNknown
the guinea pig mission didn 't work out
i 'm shutting you down
you can 't do this
you performed an UNknown UNknown compromised a two year undercover fbi operation and came out with the crucial intel that leonard saber and stand by for this makes coffee machines
this means we 'r e in big trouble now
you have to admit i UNknown e done some amazing things as far as animal intelligence in there
thanks to you those UNknown can speak
but sadly that means they 'r e now capable of exposing the derelict activities committed on my watch
i 'm not gonna take the heat for this kendall
i 'm not going down in washington as the crazy gopher guy
dr kendall 's coming with me
what about my team here ?
guys we UNknown e got company
we UNknown e got to get out of here
all right we 'r e going native
i always wanted to say that
UNknown you tell ben the UNknown file is on that UNknown
have fun in the lab
would you put that down please ?
a special UNknown on the fur
we did see UNknown talk
what are you doing ?
they 'r e everywhere !
i don 't see anything
be careful not to step on them
there 's no such thing as a UNknown UNknown
be cool if there were though
they got the whole lab surrounded
i UNknown l need to inspect your goods
yeah 20 bags of UNknown UNknown
we can hide in here
no not the cage !
get this delivery truck out of here
i don 't do cages !
now we are locked in
what do you think ?
is this the frying pan or the fire ?
let 's all agree right now
none of this goes on our r sum
we 'r e locking the building down sir but the animals have all bolted
if those animals bolted then i got a problem
i want them all back dead or alive zero exposure
three guinea pigs and a mole
i UNknown e never seen such fat animals in my life
don 't they have a gym around here ?
a UNknown juice or something ?
lay off the nuggets man
all right my UNknown little friends
welcome to your new home
why did you just do that ?
i thought it might cheer us up
you can 't just UNknown it out anytime
the world 's at stake
we got to get out of here
the feds want to turn us into guinea pigs
they UNknown l never take us seriously
well we did get the wrong file
no i downloaded the right file and we 'r e gonna prove it as soon as we find a way out of here
well let 's ask that guy
he looks cute and friendly
excuse me my UNknown little friend
may i ask you a question ?
all i 'm saying is know your place behind this line
that 's all i 'm saying
is he talking to us ?
did someone order a knuckle sandwich ?
you talk a lot of smack for a little guy buddy
for your information it 's bucky
and if you want to stay alive do not cross that line !
i love the smell of UNknown in the morning !
don 't pay any attention to him
he 's a quarter ferret
i have no ferret in me hurley
that has never been proven
then why are you marked down ?
i 'm on sale !
everyone goes on sale eventually
this should come as no surprise but he grew up in the UNknown ward at UNknown
enough with the line already
we agreed this was my zone
the mice will agree to anything
yeah he 's very sensitive
welcome my friends to the family
where is the bathroom ?
they put down newspaper every day there 's plenty to read
we don 't have time for this
i 'm gonna break the glass
i wouldn 't do that if i were you
the truth is my grandmother met a ferret at the san diego petting zoo but nothing happened
my papers say UNknown end of story
now stop looking at the line !
i am not a ferret !
you try to pull my tongue out you UNknown l see what happens
let 's check that lock
you guys from the circus or something ?
no we 'r e not from the circus
we 'r e specially bred UNknown altered
and highly trained secret agents
known as g force !
you guys are transfers from the hollywood store
go find ben and report our location
and i thought the ferret was crazy
what happened in there ?
well i told them we shouldn 't be shut down
and then i got to the bit where i talk to guinea pigs
and then that 's where i lost UNknown m
darwin told me before he left that he was positive he downloaded the right file
where is the UNknown ?
it 's still back at the warehouse
well we gotta go get it
security 's probably crawling all over the place
i UNknown e got an idea
ok what do we do about the g force ?
they 'r e highly professional
so UNknown how do you get adopted ?
act cute kid picks you out takes you home and bingo you 'r e part of the family
ben 's house is the rendezvous point
i 'm chasing my butt
how cute is that ?
i don 't have that kind of range
grandpa what is that ?
that 's a hideous crime against nature i 'd say
what can i help you with young lady ?
i am out baby !
they 'r e guinea pigs !
you try to put a bow on me you 'r e gonna lose a finger
that little girl has no idea what she 's in for !
i 'm gonna put nail polish and lipstick on her and a dress
maintain my cover until i have a chance to escape
what about that little fur ball there ?
give me the fat one
even if you forget to feed this guy every now and then it wouldn 't bother him
he 's a little plump as it is
that 's probably a good thing
what do these fellas eat ?
see you on the outside !
hey guys i can see my future !
it 's all cakes and cuddles !
you 'r e lucky i 'm not in there snake boy because it would UNknown e been lights out for you !
i would UNknown e hit you so hard you would have shed yourself
then i would have turned you into a nice pair of UNknown boots
that kid 's a monster
he just lifted him up and
what do you suggest i do ?
hey grandpa changed my mind
oh no no not upside down not upside down
where did the chubby one go ?
we have to think of a way out of here
i knew you were trouble
i can see it in your eyes
saber initiated a call to the usual UNknown mr UNknown in UNknown
he left a message saying the launch was on track for project UNknown
kip our UNknown tap just isn 't cutting it
sir with respect if you were to authorize a search warrant
i can 't authorize a search warrant without probable cause and he knows it
saber comes from the defence supply industry
this has to be against the geneva convention
we have to get out of here
this is the tenth outfit
don 't you look pretty ?
i look like paris hilton 's chihuahua
let me do this UNknown
they told me one of the mice died last week and was buried in the backyard
this woman 's really UNknown
let 's just get it on out of here pronto
that 's not the plan
good luck rest in peace and all that
you know what to do
ok he 's got it
he 's got the UNknown
what the hell was that ? !
just stay calm ok ?
look on the bright side at least you haven 't been marked down yet
what 's that on your butt ?
never seen a birthmark ?
i have seen that birthmark
i got the same one
don 't point that thing at me
seriously just look at my butt
i am a UNknown engineered super spy
ben spent years training us
that 's what they want you to think
so you UNknown l do tricks for them
but you my friend are a common everyday pet shop guinea pig just like me
we must have been separated at birth
but fate has brought us back together my brother
don 't say that word

how are we gonna do that ?
you have to admit we make a pretty sweet team
i could get used to all this secret agent stuff if you 'r e ever looking for a new recruit
hurley just be quiet and lean right
hurley what are you doing here ?
UNknown didn 't make it
what do you mean he didn 't make it ?
he was gonna break out and engineer our escape but then the mission went bad
he sacrificed himself for us
this is all my fault
ben there 's nothing you could UNknown e done
no i could UNknown e told you the truth UNknown you really are
the truth is you 'r e not UNknown engineered
so we are not special at all ?
we 'r e just common ordinary UNknown ?
i wanted you guys to think of yourselves as more than just balls of fur waiting for your next pellet
well maybe you can explain that to UNknown
ben we need to know
tell us who we are
ok you guys want to know ?
UNknown we rescued you at a roadside UNknown stand in the UNknown
i guess there you 'r e some kind of you know delicacy
blaster we found you at a UNknown company
they were testing you know some kind of hair UNknown for allergic reactions
and UNknown we found you know right before his home was dug out to build a golf course
i purchased you at a pet store
your parents abandoned you because you were the runt of the litter
i was a runt ?
what do you mean ?
i never even had a chance
ok we 'r e on it
dispatch just got a report of two giant UNknown riding a UNknown on pacific
you were right all along
i am just an average everyday pet store guinea pig
since when did you start listening to me ?
my parents didn 't even want me
look darwin you saved us from the dogs you defeated the UNknown read the stars like a map and got us here
i couldn 't have done any of that
do you have any idea how many guinea pigs could UNknown e done all those things ?
i mean literally like three
and they 'r e all in this room
yeah you 'r e right
i may not be UNknown engineered but i 'm no house pet either
what ben did was right
he wanted us to believe in ourselves
we still have our training our abilities
blaster you 'r e a graduate of west point
and UNknown how many hours have you put in on that UNknown ?
i helped with the tire !
we may be guinea pigs but we 'r e not ordinary
i UNknown e always believed
ben we don 't have much time
that UNknown 's no UNknown
when i tried to disconnect this chip it came alive and it attacked us
it was so UNknown !
if i hadn 't been there to take cover fire for darwin who knows
the UNknown UNknown caused it to transform
ben UNknown and UNknown are the same thing
UNknown UNknown in 30 minutes
i tried to access the UNknown file on your UNknown but saber he protected it with some nasty virus
i mean i 'm a little bit at a loss
if that little UNknown is all that like you say it is why don 't you just use that to destroy saber 's UNknown ?
i UNknown l go back in the box
ok let 's do this !
we don 't have our equipment
well that 's not entirely true
this is a little UNknown i UNknown e been working on called the rapid UNknown vehicle
she UNknown l do 65 with the throttle wide open
and blaster it has a rocking UNknown
that 's what 's up !
all right we got gear
and we know our mission

i don 't know what that means
but yeah that 's good

you just got out driven by UNknown
guys i 'm going in
hurley suck in your gut
blaster i need to tell you something about UNknown
you have nothing to worry about
she 's not interested in me
she 's trying to make you more interested in her by acting UNknown
members of the UNknown inner sanctum my co conspirators in this UNknown are we ready to dominate ?
are we ready to change the world ?
hurley this is our UNknown
it 's very important that you stand guard
whatever you do don 't leave this spot
hey does this mean i 'm part of the team ?
there 's the network core
we can gain access through that panel
it 's a booby trap
don 't touch it or this place UNknown l blow
i don 't think anybody UNknown l mind if i check the perimeter
as i press this button we move forward to a brave new world order owned and operated by UNknown
we 'r e too late
we can still stop it ifwe UNknown the virus into saber 's computer
oh you 'r e so beautiful !
oh come to papa !
it 's all saber sir
is this enough probable cause ?
UNknown report common household UNknown
coming to life and chasing people
those are UNknown UNknown !
but they 'r e just supposed to communicate with each other
what is that thing ?
it 's heading for the UNknown
it 's got hurley !
it 's trying to figure out how long to cook him
get me out of here !
i don 't want to be an UNknown !
we got to save him !
let 's go to plan b !
blaster UNknown that thing !
i 'm on it !
don 't let it hit the UNknown !
all teams go go !
why is this happening ?
this wasn 't the plan !
saber what 's going on ?
get us out of here !
hurley don 't be scared
just a little piece of cake !
didn 't drop the cake
hurley let 's go !
it 's gonna hit the UNknown !
we can 't get through
i 'm gonna keep going
i UNknown e got to take down the network core
hurley i told you stay put and guard the UNknown
didn 't i tell you that ?
here 's to the team
we UNknown l find another way through
i find it hard to believe you UNknown e got nothing to do with this
you have to believe me
i don 't know what 's going on
i only wanted to be the biggest UNknown manufacturer in the world
what do you want ?
i got major problems here
the transmission 's coming off the core of his computer
g force went in to shut it down
you sent those UNknown in without my authorization ?
sir i 'm picking up a video feed
it 's one of ours
what in the heck is that ?
you say that like it 's a good thing
what 's he gonna do UNknown his way out of there ?
UNknown you 'r e alive
you UNknown the bad guy 's lair
you really think i let myself get killed in a garbage truck ?
well i hid in a soup can
rode it all the way to the city dump
i can 't believe the mole was the mole
business associate of leonard saber
you tricked saber into helping you build UNknown ?
how could you do this to us ?
i thought we were friends
i put my life on the line for you
UNknown was in my basement this whole time ?
and he wasn 't a man
UNknown is the chinese word for mole
UNknown was just a cover
i created an army of UNknown UNknown and they created an array of giant UNknown UNknown
UNknown capable of pulling down all the space junk UNknown the planet and driving every human underground
so what do you think ?
you ever UNknown the word mole darwin ?
three million UNknown on how to exterminate them !
the humans came and destroyed our home destroyed our home
son if you ever get the chance to bring mankind to its knees do it
they showed us no mercy darwin
well now it 's my turn to do a little pest control
if you UNknown l excuse me it 's UNknown
he 's created some kind of monster
i think i UNknown l stay here and guard the UNknown
what 's our plan ?
stop UNknown and save the world
that 's more of a goal than a plan
i 'm feeling ten feet tall
there 's no place like home
that UNknown l leave a mark
we got to get up there and stop UNknown
how big is this thing going to get ?
you humans stole my home !
now i will steal yours
then i UNknown l shut you down
i have no quarrel with you darwin but mankind must pay
you know i can 't let you do that
hurley what are you doing ?
i gotta get you back up there
go get him bro !
it 's the only way !
it 's no fun being the little guy is it ?
UNknown if you keep doing this then you 'r e no better than the humans who destroyed your home and your family
well that 's kind of the point here
no you 'r e wrong
we 'r e your family
me and blaster and UNknown and ben and UNknown
UNknown ben took us in when nobody else wanted us
and he made us a family
we 'r e a family
what have i done ?
what have i done ?
it 's too late darwin !
i can 't stop it !
darwin it 's working !
we UNknown e gotta find hurley
this is all my fault
i just wanted you to know you were as good as anyone out there today
i don 't know what they call it back in the pet shop but out here we well we call it being a hero
all you ever wanted was a family
i never got to tell you this but
that was like a UNknown
i have a brother !
we can spend every thanksgiving together take road trips to vegas have tickle fights !
give me a hug bro
i don 't want to get too buff
welcome to your new home
ok but i 'm telling you now i don 't do well with UNknown
look UNknown i gotta know
which one of us are you interested in ?
you UNknown e gotta ask her who she 's not interested in
and that 's just how i like it
i want you to know that leonard saber has been forced to undertake the largest recall of UNknown products in history
and he 's getting help from somebody quite UNknown about the UNknown
three down 178 000 to go
i think i 'm gonna be here awhile
but i 'm gonna rejoin the team when i 'm done
if they UNknown l have me
your friend agent UNknown has been UNknown
he has a few words for you
i 'm sorry that i doubted you
how long do i have to stay down here ?
as the full details of your UNknown come to light it is an honour and a privilege to say thank you on behalf of this country
you guinea pigs pack more courage and heart into those UNknown little frames than any agents i UNknown e ever seen
g force your UNknown has been restored
guys we got our badges
not bad for a runt
thanks for believing in me ben
hurley i UNknown e been thinking
if you 'r e gonna be out there helping us save the world you 'r e gonna need this

so we 'r e finally agents
let 's get this party started right !
get him on the good foot !
g force in the house !
i got a thing for worms
i am out baby !
finally the recognition i deserve
i 'm jeff gordon !
hi i 'm rick UNknown back with more of the best of europe
this time we 'r e in north wales splitting slate exploring castles and steaming up mountains
wales top historical cultural and natural wonders are found here in the north
from UNknown mount UNknown to UNknown castles to sweeping victorian UNknown it 's a poem written in landscape
i think this area has as much site seeing UNknown and interest as any place in britain
we UNknown l mountain climb on a steam train
learn some welsh follow a miner deep into a slate mine shepherd sheep get passionate about castles and UNknown ourselves in britain 's top UNknown wonders
the british isles UNknown of england and three UNknown lands
our target this time is north wales where we UNknown l visit a beach resort two castle towns a slate mine and a national park with wales UNknown peak
we finish just over the border in the english city of liverpool
we start in UNknown a gentile victorian beach resort
it was built after the UNknown of the railroads which made the welsh sea coast easily UNknown to the english industrial UNknown
in the UNknown the notion that bathing in sea water was good for your health was UNknown
and the UNknown sea air was just what the doctor ordered
any self respecting sea resort came with a nice long pier offering vacation UNknown a day at sea and a good walk to boot
UNknown is UNknown popular with the english you won 't see many other foreigners here
the long lines of old time hotels offer their guests the UNknown welcome possible
but in the fortified castle town of UNknown just a few miles away we learn that the english weren 't always so welcome
they say wales has more castles per square mile than any place in europe
and most of them are english castles built in the 13th century by the king edward to establish english rule here and UNknown the UNknown welsh
the greatest of edward 's castles
like UNknown castle were masterpieces of medieval engineering
their towers were round tougher to break through with no corners to knock off
the castle within a castle defense gave defenders a place to retreat and UNknown UNknown on the advancing enemy or just wait for reinforcements
and with sea access they could be UNknown safely from england
UNknown castle has an interesting story and local guides who hang out at the entrance ready to take you on an inexpensive UNknown tour tell the story well
neville UNknown brings this castle to life with gusto
neville and it 's a wonderful castle because it 's two castles in one
we 'r e going through into the soldier 's part of the castle
we have this lovely great courtyard here
rick this was a practical place where the military stayed then ?
neville the military stayed here because it was simply military castle with an UNknown for the king really
this was here for the military
and all these people the king his people from london the soldiers all UNknown in here and this is the life of the castle
here 's your thick wall
so now we 'r e in the kings part of the castle
this is a luxury part
these are the royal chambers all around here
this of course is the royal courtyard for fresh air a small food store there
the servants of the castle would be in these lower rooms
and these are the royal rooms
so the welsh could be controlling all the land and the english would still be fine here because they UNknown e got the water access
neville they UNknown e got the water they UNknown e got the supplies and they UNknown e got this magnificent castle
a stroll along the best medieval walls in britain rewards you with grand and UNknown views
this garrison town was a kind of 13th century green zone or safe base for the english invaders as they tried and tried to put down the angry welsh UNknown
you can still see the original checker board street plan the english came up with when they built the castle and UNknown
this grid plan of streets dates from about UNknown when edward built UNknown and filled it with english settlers
UNknown 's charming high street leads down to the harbor which permitted edward to safely UNknown his castle
wander downhill enjoying the slice of welsh life scene
UNknown mawr a rare surviving UNknown house dates from UNknown
it was the first great welsh home to be built within UNknown 's walls
stepping into the house visitors are UNknown by the UNknown over the fireplace UNknown in its original bright colors
it UNknown the rich family 's princely UNknown
UNknown as the finest UNknown house in wales
UNknown mawr offers a delightful peek into 16th century domestic life
the lady of the house 's bedroom doubled as a sitting room with a foot warmer by the chair and a UNknown carved four poster bed
the curtains were drawn at night to keep out bugs and keep warmth in
the great chamber was for hearty UNknown followed by UNknown gaming dancing and music
all this extravagant entertainment under a ceiling full of more UNknown reflecting important UNknown UNknown if dubious family connections left a powerful impact on guests
UNknown 's harbor once vital for military purposes and then a busy industrial port is now a laid back zone that locals treat like a town square
it 's saturday night and the action is on the UNknown
the next english castle town over is UNknown
like UNknown it originated as one of king edward 's garrison towns
it still spreads out from its protective castle following edward 's original grid plan laid within its still impressive UNknown
UNknown was the most expensive castle an english king ever built
constructed as a key fortress in edward 's iron ring of castles its sheer UNknown was designed to prompt humility
it 's famous for its physical grandeur and for its association with the prince of wales
in modern times to give the welsh a sense of belonging to britain the prince of wales has been given his title here
it was here that in UNknown
queen elizabeth crowned her son charles prince of wales
it 's one of the few castles that i think manages to achieve both architecture art and UNknown at the same time
rick i don 't think you can conceive of wales without the welsh language
it 's a blessing it 's a privilege to be a UNknown who speaks welsh
traveling through wales it 's easy for the traveler not to realize that the language here actually is welsh
locals speak welsh to each other and english to visitors
while every thing here is bi UNknown welsh comes first
sheep are everywhere in wales they UNknown the countryside
and every shepherd needs a good sheep dog
dogs trained to respond to different whistles
love to bully the sheep wherever the farmer wants them to go
and every once in a while that means in for a good haircut
and where there are sheep there are UNknown mills
and some welcome the public
my favorite is in the town of UNknown where you can follow the spinning process from raw wool to the final fabric
you UNknown l see a traditional spinning wheel
and a busy historic mill in action
here the mechanical UNknown reads a pattern to weave a fine design
and if all that hard work stokes your need for a warm and UNknown souvenir that 's part of the mill visit as well
for some heavier industry we 'r e visiting UNknown UNknown the UNknown welsh slate mining town
UNknown UNknown was a company town and that company was the UNknown slate mine
slate mining played a UNknown role in welsh heritage and the UNknown mine now welcomes visitors
it does a fine job of explaining the mining culture of victorian wales
down here we 'r e about 300 feet underground
they 'd have 3 days holidays every year they were usually christmas day
good friday and thanksgiving day and they were taken without pay
now to try and cut the slate down he 'd try and cut the block in half every time
slate splitting is still done the same way today as it was 150 years ago it 's still done by hand
they UNknown e tried to invent machines to do it but at the moment nothing can beat man doing the job
and for every ton of slate the miners produced there were about 10 tons of waste left outside in heaps
singing helped the miners endure their harsh lives
while the mining culture is virtually gone the tradition of singing survives
the men 's UNknown of wales are famous for their beautiful music
town UNknown welcome visitors to both their weekly practices and their many concerts
tonight the men 's choir of UNknown is performing
for peace and UNknown don 't miss UNknown garden
the gardens terraces and delightful reflecting UNknown were designed to UNknown the existing landscape
the wild english style seems to UNknown UNknown with the more formal italian style gardens
the resort center of UNknown national park is UNknown y UNknown
while very UNknown and commercial this town is a picturesque and handy jumping off spot for exploring the UNknown wonders of north wales
UNknown y UNknown is great for family fun and it 's the spring board for a world of popular UNknown
the miners bridge is a favorite for painters
and the UNknown swallow falls are just upstream
nearby UNknown is smaller and less UNknown
this UNknown national park village also the starting point for many fine UNknown is ideal for those wanting to experience the natural grandeur of UNknown
mount UNknown the UNknown mountain in england or wales is the park 's UNknown
each year half a million people scale this 3 500 foot peak
while the standard hike to the summit takes only about four hours there 's plenty of challenge for those looking for tougher routes
in fact sir edmund UNknown and his gang trained here before UNknown mount UNknown
the easiest UNknown is by the UNknown mountain railway a 4 mile long cog railway dating from UNknown
the mighty little engines push the jam packed cars UNknown up past the tree line and ultimately to the top of wales
here on mount UNknown we 'r e the highest people anywhere in wales or england
everything we UNknown e seen so far is within about 20 miles of this spot
and there 's lots more nearby
ireland is just over the sea to the west
and about 50 miles northeast of here the UNknown performed for the first time in liverpool
liverpool just over the border in england is a UNknown but surprisingly enjoyable city
it offers a fascinating urban contrast to the natural UNknown of wales
it 's an interesting stop both for UNknown fans and for those who 'd like to look urban britain straight in the eyes
the city once run down and pretty grim is enjoying a renaissance
albert dock is the UNknown
opened in UNknown by prince albert
queen victoria 's husband the docks UNknown seven acres of water
it 's surrounded by five story tall brick warehouses now housing fine restaurants concert UNknown a convention center and fancy UNknown
in its day liverpool was england 's greatest UNknown
it UNknown as one corner of the UNknown commerce of the 18th century slave trade
british merchants and UNknown powered this three sided trading scheme
they UNknown manufactured goods to africa in exchange for UNknown africans who were then shipped to the americas and traded for raw material
like cotton tobacco and sugar which they imported back to britain
while parties on all three sides made money the big profit came home to england
as britain UNknown so did liverpool
the UNknown UNknown museum tells the story of the port of what was the second city of the british empire
after the shipping of slaves was outlawed in britain in the early UNknown
liverpool kept its port busy as a transfer point for UNknown
whether your ancestors came from UNknown
ukraine ireland or wales there 's a good chance they left europe from this port
between UNknown and 1930 nine million UNknown sailed from liverpool to find their dreams in the new world
most went to the usa
awe inspiring UNknown like the UNknown called this port home
many of us know liverpool as the UNknown for the band that changed the world back in the UNknown the UNknown
the UNknown story is a museum about the band that made rock roll a world wide phenomenon
many people visit liverpool just to remember john
ok folks on the right hand side is the UNknown house
john and paul wrote some of their first hits in this house
for a proper UNknown pilgrimage you need to take a UNknown tour
several companies run tours daily from slick big buses to more personal UNknown bus tours
this is the neighborhood known to the people of liverpool as penny lane and paul UNknown and all the UNknown would be coming here as young boys
now this is the shelter in the middle of the roundabout that paul sings about
behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout there 's a pretty nurse selling poppies from a tray
then you UNknown e got the bank on the corner the arrogant bank manager
all the people stop and say hello
all these things you see through out the year that paul UNknown describes in songs are taking place still to this day
liverpool UNknown from its UNknown UNknown to its powerful shipping heritage
and north wales from its dramatic castles to its UNknown landscape and history and from it 's natural beauty to its friendly people packs an impressive sightseeing punch
this is a fascinating corner of great britain
as we UNknown e learned again having local friends and guides to explain what we 'r e looking at brings our sightseeing to life
hi i 'm rick UNknown back with more of the best of europe

wales top historical cultural and natural wonders are found here in the north

it was built after the UNknown of the railroads which made the welsh sea coast easily UNknown to the english industrial UNknown
in the UNknown the notion that bathing in sea water was good for your health was UNknown
and the UNknown sea air was just what the doctor ordered
any self respecting sea resort came with a nice long pier offering vacation UNknown a day at sea and a good walk to boot
UNknown is UNknown popular with the english you won 't see many other foreigners here
the long lines of old time hotels offer their guests the UNknown welcome possible
but in the fortified castle town of UNknown just a few miles away we learn that the english weren 't always so welcome
they say wales has more castles per square mile than any place in europe
and most of them are english castles built in the 13th century by the king edward to establish english rule here and UNknown the UNknown welsh
the greatest of edward 's castles
like UNknown castle were masterpieces of medieval engineering
their towers were round tougher to break through with no corners to knock off
the castle within a castle defense gave defenders a place to retreat and UNknown UNknown on the advancing enemy or just wait for reinforcements
and with sea access they could be UNknown safely from england
UNknown castle has an interesting story and local guides who hang out at the entrance ready to take you on an inexpensive UNknown tour tell the story well
neville UNknown brings this castle to life with gusto
neville and it 's a wonderful castle because it 's two castles in one
we 'r e going through into the soldier 's part of the castle
we have this lovely great courtyard here
rick this was a practical place where the military stayed then ?
neville the military stayed here because it was simply military castle with an UNknown for the king really
this was here for the military
and all these people the king his people from london the soldiers all UNknown in here and this is the life of the castle
here 's your thick wall
so now we 'r e in the kings part of the castle
this is a luxury part
these are the royal chambers all around here
this of course is the royal courtyard for fresh air a small food store there
the servants of the castle would be in these lower rooms
and these are the royal rooms
so the welsh could be controlling all the land and the english would still be fine here because they UNknown e got the water access
neville they UNknown e got the water they UNknown e got the supplies and they UNknown e got this magnificent castle
a stroll along the best medieval walls in britain rewards you with grand and UNknown views
this garrison town was a kind of 13th century green zone or safe base for the english invaders as they tried and tried to put down the angry welsh UNknown
you can still see the original checker board street plan the english came up with when they built the castle and UNknown
this grid plan of streets dates from about UNknown when edward built UNknown and filled it with english settlers
UNknown 's charming high street leads down to the harbor which permitted edward to safely UNknown his castle
wander downhill enjoying the slice of welsh life scene
UNknown mawr a rare surviving UNknown house dates from UNknown
it was the first great welsh home to be built within UNknown 's walls
stepping into the house visitors are UNknown by the UNknown over the fireplace UNknown in its original bright colors
it UNknown the rich family 's princely UNknown
UNknown as the finest UNknown house in wales
UNknown mawr offers a delightful peek into 16th century domestic life
the lady of the house 's bedroom doubled as a sitting room with a foot warmer by the chair and a UNknown carved four poster bed
the curtains were drawn at night to keep out bugs and keep warmth in
the great chamber was for hearty UNknown followed by UNknown gaming dancing and music
all this extravagant entertainment under a ceiling full of more UNknown reflecting important UNknown UNknown if dubious family connections left a powerful impact on guests
UNknown 's harbor once vital for military purposes and then a busy industrial port is now a laid back zone that locals treat like a town square
it 's saturday night and the action is on the UNknown
the next english castle town over is UNknown
like UNknown it originated as one of king edward 's garrison towns
it still spreads out from its protective castle following edward 's original grid plan laid within its still impressive UNknown
UNknown was the most expensive castle an english king ever built
constructed as a key fortress in edward 's iron ring of castles its sheer UNknown was designed to prompt humility
it 's famous for its physical grandeur and for its association with the prince of wales
in modern times to give the welsh a sense of belonging to britain the prince of wales has been given his title here
it was here that in UNknown
queen elizabeth crowned her son charles prince of wales
it 's one of the few castles that i think manages to achieve both architecture art and UNknown at the same time
rick i don 't think you can conceive of wales without the welsh language
it 's a blessing it 's a privilege to be a UNknown who speaks welsh
traveling through wales it 's easy for the traveler not to realize that the language here actually is welsh
locals speak welsh to each other and english to visitors
while every thing here is bi UNknown welsh comes first
sheep are everywhere in wales they UNknown the countryside
and every shepherd needs a good sheep dog
dogs trained to respond to different whistles
love to bully the sheep wherever the farmer wants them to go
and every once in a while that means in for a good haircut
and where there are sheep there are UNknown mills
and some welcome the public
my favorite is in the town of UNknown where you can follow the spinning process from raw wool to the final fabric
you UNknown l see a traditional spinning wheel
and a busy historic mill in action
here the mechanical UNknown reads a pattern to weave a fine design
and if all that hard work stokes your need for a warm and UNknown souvenir that 's part of the mill visit as well
for some heavier industry we 'r e visiting UNknown UNknown the UNknown welsh slate mining town
UNknown UNknown was a company town and that company was the UNknown slate mine
slate mining played a UNknown role in welsh heritage and the UNknown mine now welcomes visitors
it does a fine job of explaining the mining culture of victorian wales
down here we 'r e about 300 feet underground
they 'd have 3 days holidays every year they were usually christmas day
good friday and thanksgiving day and they were taken without pay
now to try and cut the slate down he 'd try and cut the block in half every time
slate splitting is still done the same way today as it was 150 years ago it 's still done by hand
they UNknown e tried to invent machines to do it but at the moment nothing can beat man doing the job
and for every ton of slate the miners produced there were about 10 tons of waste left outside in heaps
singing helped the miners endure their harsh lives
while the mining culture is virtually gone the tradition of singing survives
the men 's UNknown of wales are famous for their beautiful music
town UNknown welcome visitors to both their weekly practices and their many concerts
tonight the men 's choir of UNknown is performing
for peace and UNknown don 't miss UNknown garden
the gardens terraces and delightful reflecting UNknown were designed to UNknown the existing landscape
the wild english style seems to UNknown UNknown with the more formal italian style gardens
the resort center of UNknown national park is UNknown y UNknown
while very UNknown and commercial this town is a picturesque and handy jumping off spot for exploring the UNknown wonders of north wales
UNknown y UNknown is great for family fun and it 's the spring board for a world of popular UNknown
the miners bridge is a favorite for painters
and the UNknown swallow falls are just upstream
nearby UNknown is smaller and less UNknown
this UNknown national park village also the starting point for many fine UNknown is ideal for those wanting to experience the natural grandeur of UNknown
mount UNknown the UNknown mountain in england or wales is the park 's UNknown
each year half a million people scale this 3 500 foot peak
while the standard hike to the summit takes only about four hours there 's plenty of challenge for those looking for tougher routes
in fact sir edmund UNknown and his gang trained here before UNknown mount UNknown
the easiest UNknown is by the UNknown mountain railway a 4 mile long cog railway dating from UNknown
the mighty little engines push the jam packed cars UNknown up past the tree line and ultimately to the top of wales
here on mount UNknown we 'r e the highest people anywhere in wales or england
everything we UNknown e seen so far is within about 20 miles of this spot
and there 's lots more nearby
ireland is just over the sea to the west
and about 50 miles northeast of here the UNknown performed for the first time in liverpool
liverpool just over the border in england is a UNknown but surprisingly enjoyable city
it offers a fascinating urban contrast to the natural UNknown of wales
it 's an interesting stop both for UNknown fans and for those who 'd like to look urban britain straight in the eyes
the city once run down and pretty grim is enjoying a renaissance
albert dock is the UNknown
opened in UNknown by prince albert
queen victoria 's husband the docks UNknown seven acres of water
it 's surrounded by five story tall brick warehouses now housing fine restaurants concert UNknown a convention center and fancy UNknown
in its day liverpool was england 's greatest UNknown
it UNknown as one corner of the UNknown commerce of the 18th century slave trade
british merchants and UNknown powered this three sided trading scheme
they UNknown manufactured goods to africa in exchange for UNknown africans who were then shipped to the americas and traded for raw material
like cotton tobacco and sugar which they imported back to britain
while parties on all three sides made money the big profit came home to england
as britain UNknown so did liverpool
the UNknown UNknown museum tells the story of the port of what was the second city of the british empire
after the shipping of slaves was outlawed in britain in the early UNknown
liverpool kept its port busy as a transfer point for UNknown
whether your ancestors came from UNknown
ukraine ireland or wales there 's a good chance they left europe from this port
between UNknown and 1930 nine million UNknown sailed from liverpool to find their dreams in the new world
most went to the usa
awe inspiring UNknown like the UNknown called this port home
many of us know liverpool as the UNknown for the band that changed the world back in the UNknown the UNknown
the UNknown story is a museum about the band that made rock roll a world wide phenomenon
many people visit liverpool just to remember john
ok folks on the right hand side is the UNknown house
john and paul wrote some of their first hits in this house
for a proper UNknown pilgrimage you need to take a UNknown tour
several companies run tours daily from slick big buses to more personal UNknown bus tours
this is the neighborhood known to the people of liverpool as penny lane and paul UNknown and all the UNknown would be coming here as young boys
now this is the shelter in the middle of the roundabout that paul sings about
behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout there 's a pretty nurse selling poppies from a tray
then you UNknown e got the bank on the corner the arrogant bank manager
all the people stop and say hello
all these things you see through out the year that paul UNknown describes in songs are taking place still to this day
liverpool UNknown from its UNknown UNknown to its powerful shipping heritage
and north wales from its dramatic castles to its UNknown landscape and history and from it 's natural beauty to its friendly people packs an impressive sightseeing punch
this is a fascinating corner of great britain
as we UNknown e learned again having local friends and guides to explain what we 'r e looking at brings our sightseeing to life
the late fourth century a d the roman empire began to crumble
alexandria in the province of egypt still retained some of its UNknown possessed one of the seven wonders of the ancient world the legendary lighthouse and the biggest library known
the library was a not only cultural but a religious symbol a place where the UNknown UNknown their ancestral gods
the traditional pagan worship in the city now UNknown with the jews and an UNknown religion up to now banned christianity
library of alexandria 391 a d
after taking the library many UNknown were converted
UNknown continued teaching and UNknown while his former students held important positions in the social elite
the empire was split in two forever
many christians saw this as a sign of the end of the world and decided to prepare by practicing a more holy life
the order of UNknown monks was charged to go through the streets and watch for christian morality now uneven by the presence of the jews
but what about here on earth ?
what may should be ?
has anyone ever thought about your your feet your feet that holds all things together pull them together
if there is no center the universe would be deformed infinite UNknown
doesn 't matter that we were
what you will do ?
that 's right never being born
library of alexandria 391 ad
lord of the universe origin of all things eternal force of the UNknown where everything has its beginning and its end
and all the gods UNknown that protect us both in heaven and on earth
something happens in the market
i know you also feel something
tell the master that we leave
he was counting me as the part of their conquests
this UNknown also foolish as his father
what happen 227 had become 16 ?

earth is the center of the UNknown and UNknown around the sun and the five UNknown
mercury venus mars jupiter and UNknown
never UNknown the law of the circle never
UNknown told me show as do obey affected if you see them move
one travel around the earth and the smaller circle
loop the UNknown say you see is not happen on the earth but our eyes deceive us
i like you do the explanation search even paying course attention or not
one or two up here
i tell you the gods should consulted to me before they creating anything
why is the joint take of two circles ?
would not be more perfect if the wander is if wander and a single circle give sense to everything ?
what authority do you judge the work of god ?
what is wrong with you christians ?
the man is no longer with brief mouth in this city
could you decide creation you could decide a lord and you offended
you should move to the desert
you will not hear anything offensive there
you know nothing about you speak
what this you can explain to all ?
what is the question ?
now i am actually say with everybody here in this room
did you remember the fights are a thing of slaves and rabble

and then it will be too late because only those who believed in jesus we UNknown l be saved
what are you waiting for ?
do you understand like man do
what are you looking here ?

do you want to see a miracle ?
jesus traveled throughout galilee teaching in their UNknown
preaching the good news for you and curing diseases people
in all he talked about UNknown and people came to see him worldwide
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
blessed are they that mourn
blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth
blessed are those who have hunger and thirst for righteousness will be satisfied

good day ma 'a m
yesterday many people see on your colleague present
you say you have found
yesterday we were discussing the UNknown cone
we speak of the circle of the UNknown and UNknown
UNknown requires your present urgently to UNknown
how is to enjoy that make us swallow the faith and customs the people until recently were coming out rule ?
it 's a sacrilege !
christians have met in the UNknown
must stop these insults !
he may not fear him
what is it you are going to do ?
are you going to attack them ?
are you going to staying your hands with blood for an insult ?
an insult to the gods !
if you feel so bad report them to the prefect
it might seem that you protecting them i try to protect our disciples
you who are inciting them to be murderers
UNknown as director you have the last word
the insult must to be answered
the jews can do what they want is not your battle
ask to your christians you would do well join us with your rank
you will not caused my disciples out of this house !
now all the gods !
wait for my command !
let us listen now !
this one have no voice too !
their mouths do not speak their eyes do not see his nose does not smell

i wanted you to be free
where are the gods now ?

the god of the christians ? such a fool !
what do you think lady ?
the day that you criticize and i call it when it 's call
yes thought actually i criticizing UNknown
but it 's so absurd so old
UNknown argued that the earth moves
and make as just be another wanderer
his work was lost in the fire that destroyed mother 's library
that 's way we have to take great care of this place
if the earth is moving every time dropping an object should fall further behind
and the wind always blow against us
and the birds would be wipe on
i told you the hypothesis of UNknown that no sense at all
i feel that what you said be UNknown
but right now i do not know how
make way for the prefect !
make way for the prefect !
UNknown augustus emperor and supreme head of the provinces of the UNknown having been informed hereby declare and command
let me UNknown be forgiven and released
in exchange for my generosity the UNknown leave the UNknown and the library immediately and make use of facilities whatever you like
what can we expect ?
and they will be escorted to their homes
send half a regiment the other side
i want they may not contain long
let the minor works !
what are the minor works ? take only important !
have you seen my mistress ?
just get out here and help !
we can not with so many !
UNknown and her students follow in the atrium
if they want let them burn
where are you going ?
where are you going ?
if you want to die by our gods let him
they 'r e just a bunch of thugs a bunch of animals
UNknown my dear friend calm down
let bishop cyril begun his own depend
hung hi has just called UNknown them self strong enough to carry loads repel six UNknown
because it is the sabbath !
on the sabbath you should honor god in your UNknown instead stopping yourself set in theater
friends there are more things that unite us than divide us
where would you christians be without the jews ?
jesus was a jew !
why cyril begin to cleaning up the city ? is he not satisfied with what they already have ?
he just wants to scare the jews but why you say then before
i 'm as christian as he
yes but forget that many of your friends that circle are not
i would like you to take the sack and flying to top the mast
will you finally tell me what the point ?
when UNknown drop the sack the boat will be moving forward
but you 'r e wrong !
yes but this is definitely proved
why are you troubled yourself by that lady ?
UNknown as this with you warrior
a few years ago you was not so UNknown prefect
a few years ago i spoke first before thinking
venus and mars share house in UNknown
my father would have celebrated something like a good wine
what chance for you talking about ?
do not you know that the universe is a huge chest don 't you ?
they laid on top and the earth ground
in this idiot not been told that the earth is round !
your head is really flat
if the earth is round
why not the people that live in the bottom fall out ?
what about the one sides ?
what do you say ?
does the earth is flat or round ?
only god knows these things
leave them in the ground !
where they are belong !
today in the boat you make great progress
why do the wandering very that UNknown so unexpected ?
why does the sun ?
why is change size summer to winter ?
perhaps it 's because and sometimes farther ?
according UNknown the sun must be in the center of everything
with us the earth traveling in a circle around him
therefore and this is the key
we are always exactly same distance
san alejandro is on fire !
where 's the fire ?
last night is one night was deplorable
now i say to you
grave no longer for our dead brothers weep not
then they they know neither god neither love nor holiness
i do not know because in this day who repeated the scriptures without understanding at all
it is they who saw only a man when the son of god standing on the front of us
it is god will cursed and exiled until the end of time
lady do not stop lady
now whole the jews want revenge !
sorry to interrupt like this
lady you know risk to coming here
where are the troops ?
why do not more soldiers on the streets ?
no army can contain entire city
but if you do nothing now
i believe that cyril will continue do the same thing over and over again until no people for this government to govern
is the first kill them and then buried them
what is he doing here ?
i UNknown l find out
it 's my little library of alexandria
this is where i teach children
UNknown and should be here by now
often i look and wonder why the circle co axis
what i get to sit here again
a long time not do nothing to hit my head
two christians in the hands of a pagan
does god speak to you ?
today he UNknown to me
jesus forgave on the cross
jesus was god and only he can show such leniency
his will save us on the stones
god wants us here doing what we do
my suggestion as your humble adviser in this case
let peace be the first
it does not seem very encouraging
he want come to you
demands that you see in the library during the service on sunday
only christians have entered there since its looting
if you think that your presence so essential
why not let you baptize ?
why then should this assembly accept the consult of someone who ability UNknown absolutely nothing ?
i UNknown e been studying absolutely no life for my own
forget about what i said today
is all life holds for me ?
fathom this a little more
why that 's mean so much to you ?
believe me lady it 's best that nobody notices
really not it important ? i do not understand why you insist moving the ground they walk on
dress yourself what happened on the boat
since plato all of them
UNknown UNknown UNknown all have tried reconcile their observations
lady there is no UNknown than the circle you yourself have taught us
i know but suppose that the purity the circle prevented us from seeing beyond
just like the sunshine prevents us from seeing stars
i must begin again with new eyes
reading the first letter paul to timothy
i therefore wish that everywhere men would lift their prayers without anger or disputes
equally that women desire dress UNknown decency and UNknown without braids in her hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes but with good deeds
why read this passage ?
i do not know i promise which is not agreed
let the woman learn to teach or have authority over a man but to be silent
and yet they admire and even trust in words obey woman
a woman who declare in public her UNknown
this is the word of god
she not you going to kneel ?
i am a christian !
make way for the prefect !
i am a baptized christian !
i am a baptized christian !
it 's to be possible ?
take me to the prefect immediately
do you think i had about this ?
but had she face here if to betray you ? are you blind ?
it was my head what he 's wanted for all along is me
then swear your allegiance to me
condemn him or get out
on my knees if necessary nut not only that in day i can gather with other UNknown any monks who desert against cyril
but i must ask you question
UNknown do you believe in jesus ?
what ? do you believe in jesus ?
are you a true christian
what choice did i have ?
to betray UNknown ? condemn her ?
it is he who offends god
he depending in he christian
christian is words to use the scriptures just read
how many women do you
the scriptures is corrected and were in their hands
brother do not you see ?
do not see the insult to god front of everyone ?
i do not know what don 't tell me UNknown you believe me what is written
death defending your faith in christ
i proclaimed you one mother a saint
little more can i say to you
why did can not we do more easy and effective ?
what do you talking about ?
let 's shake for a moment
what shape would it show us ? what shape
you said once the problem is the UNknown of the sun
yes i did good good put it into words
the sun must be at the center as we turned around
how could occupy two position ?
how can occupy two position at once ?
and the other one here
that is impossible mistress wait what we know about the circle ?
what if the center divided into two
okay i UNknown l show you what
as i move this rod along the rope a UNknown increases and the other UNknown
thus the sum of the two always constant
what will be obtained ?
complete and ready UNknown i mean that is what is this ?
what do you think ?
this could be solved mistress
well done we will with this tomorrow
why do not you sit down ?
all the UNknown that have not yet embraced christian faith should be baptized in public
the aim very clear add to our cause all christians in the city to fight for me
it 's seem already decided i do not understand to that required my presence here
i 'm not a member of the government
if two are all are equal to each other
all three of us we are good people !
and you are so christian as we are !
the earth UNknown around the sun

what are you looking here ?
are you UNknown who made the miracle ?
do you want to see a miracle ?
jesus traveled throughout galilee teaching in their UNknown
preaching the good news for you and curing diseases people
in all he talked about UNknown and people came to see him worldwide
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
blessed are they that mourn
blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth
blessed are those who have hunger and thirst for righteousness will be satisfied
the word of god !
blessed are the pure in heart they shall see god
the lord be with you
what did you think ?
should probably you not even know how
what you got in your sack ?
do you have food ?

what 's wrong with you ?
i have to pay that with my own money !
what do you need the money for ?
that is the miracle ! go on keep doing
you look like a true UNknown
a true soldier of christ
what do they say now ? telling them to dance
the men now happy with wine
end the last two !
i am UNknown son of UNknown
i here to declare my love for UNknown the philosopher some time i following the
i have dedicated myself to music hope so seeking solace in the harmony of it sound
but for me such harmony only found in my lady so
my UNknown subject to a man ?
without read and to teach ?
for even speak her mind ? the most brilliant philosopher i know hanging to give up the science
no could be death to her
but UNknown do not forget their plight
she 's a woman right ?
our father who art in heaven
do not let it be another
please do not let it is another
good day ma 'a m
yesterday many people see on your colleague present
yesterday we were discussing the UNknown cone
we speak of the circle of the UNknown and UNknown
UNknown requires your present urgently to UNknown
how is to enjoy that make us swallow the faith and customs the people until recently were coming out rule ?
it 's a sacrilege !
christians have met in the UNknown
must stop these insults !
he may not fear him
what is it you are going to do ?
are you going to attack them ?
are you going to staying your hands with blood for an insult ?
an insult to the gods !
if you feel so bad report them to the prefect
it might seem that you protecting them i try to protect our disciples
you who are inciting them to be murderers
UNknown as director you have the last word
the insult must to be answered
the jews can do what they want is not your battle
ask to your christians you would do well join us with your rank
you will not caused my disciples out of this house !
now all the gods !
wait for my command !
let us listen now !
this one have no voice too !
their mouths do not speak their eyes do not see his nose does not smell
still UNknown until they kneel before them !
what madness is this ?
take care of your master !
what are you looking that ?
i am a christian !
i am a christian !
i am a christian !
death to the heathens !
no ! the entrance we must defend the entrance !
our men still out there !
may the gods protect them
any christian that you catch to be a hostage
take the our injured to the temple and christians to the basement
yes and these three as well
if you are christian go to the basement
UNknown is my brothers i will go as prisoner with them
if necessary so do that
if anyone anyone dares laying finger on one of my brothers
when is so many christians ?
we will have to negotiate
tell me what can we expect of a christian emperor except we put the soul
nobody leaves the group please
what are you doing ?
slaves in the bottom ! three comes out
father why you laid the dice
remember me as i was before before when i could still think
and i listened to you
how could i UNknown e been so wrong ?
i wanted you to be free
where are the gods now ?
you 'd better find another other ?
the god of the christians ? such a fool !
what do you think lady ?
yes thought actually i criticizing UNknown
but i do not know i have simple minded
so am i right or ? what if
but it 's so absurd so old
UNknown argued that the earth moves
and make as just be another wanderer
his work was lost in the fire that destroyed mother 's library
that 's way we have to take great care of this place
if the earth is moving every time dropping an object should fall further behind
and the wind always blow against us
and the birds would be wipe on
i told you the hypothesis of UNknown that no sense at all
i feel that what you said be UNknown
but right now i do not know how
make way for the prefect !
make way for the prefect !
UNknown augustus emperor and supreme head of the provinces of the UNknown having been informed hereby declare and command
let me UNknown be forgiven and released
in exchange for my generosity the UNknown leave the UNknown and the library immediately and make use of facilities whatever you like
what can we expect ?
and they will be escorted to their homes
send half a regiment the other side
i want they may not contain long
let the minor works !
what are the minor works ? take only important !
have you seen my mistress ?
just get out here and help !
we can not with so many !
UNknown and her students follow in the atrium
if they want let them burn
where are you going ?
where are you going ?
if you want to die by our gods let him
they 'r e just a bunch of thugs a bunch of animals
UNknown my dear friend calm down
let bishop cyril begun his own depend
hung hi has just called UNknown them self strong enough to carry loads repel six UNknown
because it is the sabbath !
on the sabbath you should honor god in your UNknown instead stopping yourself set in theater
friends there are more things that unite us than divide us
where would you christians be without the jews ?
jesus was a jew !
why cyril begin to cleaning up the city ? is he not satisfied with what they already have ?
he just wants to scare the jews but why you say then before
i 'm as christian as he
yes but forget that many of your friends that circle are not
i would like you to take the sack and flying to top the mast
will you finally tell me what the point ?
when UNknown drop the sack the boat will be moving forward
but you 'r e wrong !
yes but this is definitely proved
why are you troubled yourself by that lady ?
UNknown as this with you warrior
a few years ago you was not so UNknown prefect
venus and mars share house in UNknown
my father would have celebrated something like a good wine
what chance for you talking about ?
do not you know that the universe is a huge chest don 't you ?
they laid on top and the earth ground
in this idiot not been told that the earth is round !
your head is really flat
if the earth is round
why not the people that live in the bottom fall out ?
what about the one sides ?
what do you say ?
does the earth is flat or round ?
only god knows these things
leave them in the ground !
where they are belong !
today in the boat you make great progress
why do the wandering very that UNknown so unexpected ?
why does the sun ?
why is change size summer to winter ?
perhaps it 's because and sometimes farther ?
according UNknown the sun must be in the center of everything
with us the earth traveling in a circle around him
therefore and this is the key
we are always exactly same distance
san alejandro is on fire !
where 's the fire ?
last night is one night was deplorable
now i say to you
grave no longer for our dead brothers weep not
then they they know neither god neither love nor holiness
i do not know because in this day who repeated the scriptures without understanding at all
it is they who saw only a man when the son of god standing on the front of us
it is god will cursed and exiled until the end of time
lady do not stop lady
now whole the jews want revenge !
sorry to interrupt like this
lady you know risk to coming here
where are the troops ?
why do not more soldiers on the streets ?
but if you do nothing now
i believe that cyril will continue do the same thing over and over again until no people for this government to govern
is the first kill them and then buried them
what is he doing here ?
i UNknown l find out
it 's my little library of alexandria
this is where i teach children
UNknown and should be here by now
often i look and wonder why the circle co axis
what i get to sit here again
a long time not do nothing to hit my head
two christians in the hands of a pagan
does god speak to you ?
today he UNknown to me
jesus forgave on the cross
jesus was god and only he can show such leniency
his will save us on the stones
god wants us here doing what we do
my suggestion as your humble adviser in this case
let peace be the first
it does not seem very encouraging
he want come to you
demands that you see in the library during the service on sunday
only christians have entered there since its looting
if you think that your presence so essential
why not let you baptize ?
why then should this assembly accept the consult of someone who ability UNknown absolutely nothing ?
i UNknown e been studying absolutely no life for my own
forget about what i said today
is all life holds for me ?
fathom this a little more
why that 's mean so much to you ?
believe me lady it 's best that nobody notices
really not it important ? i do not understand why you insist moving the ground they walk on
dress yourself what happened on the boat
since plato all of them
UNknown UNknown UNknown all have tried reconcile their observations
lady there is no UNknown than the circle you yourself have taught us
i know but suppose that the purity the circle prevented us from seeing beyond
just like the sunshine prevents us from seeing stars
i must begin again with new eyes
reading the first letter paul to timothy
i therefore wish that everywhere men would lift their prayers without anger or disputes
equally that women desire dress UNknown decency and UNknown without braids in her hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes but with good deeds
why read this passage ?
i do not know i promise which is not agreed
let the woman learn to teach or have authority over a man but to be silent
and yet they admire and even trust in words obey woman
a woman who declare in public her UNknown
this is the word of god
she not you going to kneel ?
i am a christian !
make way for the prefect !
i am a baptized christian !
i am a baptized christian !
it 's to be possible ?
take me to the prefect immediately
do you think i had about this ?
but had she face here if to betray you ? are you blind ?
it was my head what he 's wanted for all along is me
then swear your allegiance to me
condemn him or get out
on my knees if necessary nut not only that in day i can gather with other UNknown any monks who desert against cyril
but i must ask you question
UNknown do you believe in jesus ?
what ? do you believe in jesus ?
are you a true christian
what choice did i have ?
to betray UNknown ? condemn her ?
it is he who offends god
he depending in he christian
the scriptures is corrected and were in their hands
brother do not you see ?
do not see the insult to god front of everyone ?
i do not know what don 't tell me UNknown you believe me what is written
death defending your faith in christ
little more can i say to you
why did can not we do more easy and effective ?
what do you talking about ?
what shape would it show us ? what shape
you said once the problem is the UNknown of the sun
yes i did good good put it into words
the sun must be at the center as we turned around
how could occupy two position ?
how can occupy two position at once ?
and the other one here
that is impossible mistress wait what we know about the circle ?
what if the center divided into two
okay i UNknown l show you what
as i move this rod along the rope a UNknown increases and the other UNknown
thus the sum of the two always constant
what will be obtained ?
complete and ready UNknown i mean that is what is this ?
what do you think ?
this could be solved mistress
well done we will with this tomorrow
why do not you sit down ?
all the UNknown that have not yet embraced christian faith should be baptized in public
the aim very clear add to our cause all christians in the city to fight for me
it 's seem already decided i do not understand to that required my presence here
i 'm not a member of the government
if two are all are equal to each other
all three of us we are good people !
and you are so christian as we are !
the earth UNknown around the sun
you must let me go
i talk to her !
yes what do you want ?
i need to talk to her
it is so urgent !
it was a slave once
wait please ! i beg you
if you not agree i can no longer protect you
do not you see ?
i can not go without you
where are you going ?
that 's it so the god can be hold in all your filthy whore the way you knock
the prefect so hard ?
do not stand your hands with UNknown blood
the body of UNknown was mutilated and the remains were dragged through the streets and burned in a fire
UNknown was outlawed forever and UNknown took control of the power in alexandria
later UNknown was declared a saint and doctor of the church
although not any of UNknown works remains it is known that she was an exceptional UNknown well known for the mathematical study of UNknown curves
one thousand two hundred years later in the 17th century UNknown johannes UNknown described that one of those curves the UNknown UNknown the movement of the planets
my brother in law killed my sister
a day of joy !
you 'r e with us at last and
i don t think any other election to our ranks gave me as much happiness as yours
except mine and a few more !
it 's because you and i have known each other from a tender age
i was your UNknown and you my la bo tie
so as i must force my talent to receive your praise i ought to stop
if you were still young without the wisdom that stopped you UNknown the jungles and UNknown to become as argued by the spiteful an indoor explorer
your main claim to fame is that you UNknown e remained a good guy
not only a good guy but a good character !
not just a good character but a girlish charmer !
if you thought sir to offend my modesty then you don 't know me to the core
i greatly appreciated your conclusion about my girlish charm
coming from you it s better than a compliment it s a guarantee
it 's better than a certificate
it 's a label !
who will be et cetera et cetera !
by you sir who gives modern psychoanalysis so much of its UNknown
there 's no secret !
so let 's be clear
this supper at home later i m not UNknown it !
so please go tell your miss whims it s out of the question
you voted for me mr duke ?
because you are a significant writer !
a french author who brings honour to france !
sounds like my funeral !
she s set her mind on it !
there 's no question of us dining together
i don t think that s a good idea
i really want to dine with both of you
i also think you should my great !
see how she looks at you ?
academic glory and the effects of glory
the effects of academic glory on an already famous writer
no i beg you !
well the most striking effect is UNknown sexual
under the influence of having heard my talent so celebrated
i m now plagued by a UNknown emotion !
what 's the source of your inspiration ?
what 's your connection to italy ?
what re we talking about italy or me ?
the mafia does not exist
the mafia is an invention of the media
the vatican too i suppose ?
of course the vatican too !
the UNknown have always been UNknown characters
the latter is not only UNknown but pay attention polish !
so you two my dears
believe what you want !
i don t believe it i m just trying to understand
it s not abnormal right ?
nothing s abnormal it 's extremely simple
one day at the UNknown UNknown de france
i 'd just given my lesson i saw a girl waiting
she said professor i said miss
that 's no reason not to
i want to tell you my secret
it 's painful for the relatives but
and you listen your sister isn 't dead she just disappeared

we d have found the body !
i tell you i don t follow any of this !

your UNknown has a double ear infection
he s endured the martyr
but unfortunately we know chronic ear UNknown are the lot of UNknown
they lack ventilation UNknown from their UNknown ears
so i asked my assistant to make a UNknown
but what s a UNknown ?
what is a UNknown explain dear ?
a UNknown will remove the UNknown canal that sometimes leads directly outside
and then no more dirt no more ear UNknown
i 'm a roman !
say what you want but she is !
raise your foot a little baby
our friend can t keep up !
he s an old man you know
he 's cute this l on !
but i know the outside bunny i know it
i saw it when we arrived
the moon was shining on it
my great grandfather built it
he was a senator in la UNknown
he built two because he had two sons
but one is dead so the other got both
the other was my grandfather
right kids i m going inside
don t be too sad
the barbed wire is safer
are there any UNknown ?
this is the second house
you UNknown e seen mine
you know what she told me at the clinic ?
she s coming to live here at the end of the month
my grandfather had three boys
the first was l UNknown
he was muriel 's father
the second was my father
go home to your mama maybe there 's a fire !
they loved each other so much they went into business
it was the firm UNknown brothers
two accidents very close together
my uncle on the north highway with my aunt
papa on the south highway with mom
tragic the law of UNknown !
the third is called jocelyn
the third what dear ?
he took over the firm
he 's very short with a UNknown
he UNknown l probably come to this soir e
then the morning after !
just now i thought i saw some little UNknown
what if we made a little fire ?
no we 'r e going home
have you warmed up ?
she 's very UNknown but you can see she really likes us
she 's a friend of mine !
i 'm normal i keep normal hours
sorry but i 'm hungry at set times
i UNknown e noticed you 'r e hungry very often
they transfer it to food !
uncle l UNknown aunt marie and papa and mama died in fake accidents !
you know very well that someone killed them
i know you believe it
my sister UNknown UNknown was a financial wizard but he wanted it all
he exploited her all he could
but it 's staggering !
it 's better than UNknown !
i ask the same thing why ?
because she knew too much !
the hunchback doesn 't hunt alone
i think the mafia are behind it
what 'r e you saying ?
what 'r e you trying to say ?
he has the mentality to kill
and you saw it ?
did it not bother her to be alongside a brute ?
your truly sensational sister !
no he 's such a powerful brute !
let me tell you i don 't give a damn about this man !
he killed her sister !
why else you here ?
you 'r e sulking ?
do what you 'r e told !
we know the number !
why the hell not ?
i 'm begging you !
what 's he like ?
large and ugly distinct UNknown ears
mr UNknown court of UNknown ?
UNknown court at your service d UNknown for short !

we were told you are someone who UNknown sporting UNknown
my friend is trying to say that everything is cultural
mozart is culture UNknown is culture UNknown is culture !
little strange isn 't he ?
no need to explain you find them everywhere
it 's a front dumb ass !
but only from eastern europe
basically what have you ?
same story very expensive costs an arm and a leg
so wisdom suggests the UNknown UNknown still a balance between quality and price on the world stage
so that 's my niche
and my niche what 's that ?
it 's the UNknown !
can get them in UNknown !
it flows from the source by cattle trucks UNknown cars by cargo ships charter flights d UNknown will provide the west with these animals first !
brought in by commie aircraft
is that clear enough in your head ?
he UNknown l be the death of me !
i UNknown l put you in the furnace !
to melt your UNknown !
if you screw up again i won 't pay and you UNknown l end up very miserable !
the name probably means nothing but he put his time in with the commies
won silver at the last olympics
the tragedy is that he 's gained all this lard
when i gave him the freedom to choose he yelled thank you he kissed my hands but he bathed himself in lard
he 's a fatty !
now he 's just half as heavy
in three months i UNknown l have found a way and he UNknown l play with the pros i 'm sure he has the potential !
as you know professor when we least expect it it comes back in our face !
almost complete and it 's immense !
i will compete here !
i 'm just back from moscow

believe it or not i UNknown e put the soviet national team under contract
who will they be up against ?
i want to point out that the russians are very blond

blacks against whites would be ok but ordinary
i 'm declaring it blacks against very whites
with that i UNknown l pack this place !
friend get outta here !

it 's UNknown it 's etienne
i know my love they told me all about it
UNknown told me you two are joined at the hip !
but as you can see he 's hideous
he is absolutely hideous !
come closer to me my love come closer
you there stop and look at me
you know what he thinks my UNknown ?
he is very shy but he talks to me
i see that i 'm in luck
mrs UNknown just told me that you often return very late
or very early it depends what 's going on ?
professor i won 't deny that this is a little delicate
explain we UNknown l see
you remember your function last friday night ?
that night you did a book signing and mr UNknown too
i hope they will be dropped
we 'r e working on that
the witnesses claim that mr UNknown had taken drink
the trouble you can imagine is what happened in the elevator
i don 't know what happened commissioner
ask the them at the hotel at no time did i take the elevator
three women say they were abused in the elevator
possible i was not there
abused by mr UNknown alone ?
i don 't know !
i 'm not accusing anyone !
fortunately abused does not mean assaulted
here in the full light
this person this cop who came to our home was here basically to warn me
professor we ask you with all due respect to put a lid on it
i didn 't know what he was on about
as you know i 'm very dry
sir i wasn 't expecting this !
sir let those in high places know that i myself abruptly terminated the UNknown because i know this
that is the simple truth
i UNknown e told you so
be glad he 's gone
my so called friend has UNknown his hook and i say good riddance !
i told you twenty times he will go but i UNknown e never said good riddance
probably the saddest of my life
i hang on to an atrocious memory
do you realise that it 's going on six weeks since you looked at me like a human being ?
he was buried without me
i know les UNknown is very far
me always absent and the kids with the measles
did i say the measles ?
you 'r e disgusting !
i don 't deny the word i was in the past right ?
i was i 'm not anymore
i return to you UNknown !
faith is love therefore forgiveness and here i am in front of you
very simply very humbly i ask forgiveness
it will be hard but i know that one day you will forgive me
oh please don 't cry !
spare me your tears i 'm embarrassed !
i knew him in 6th class he was a charming child
he lived on UNknown us on gay UNknown
he had a UNknown of course
his family lived in misery
the father was a mason but unemployed 9 months of the year
hardship we can barely imagine
but no i 'm listening
gifted bright delicious and i was seduced
in our UNknown and our twenties i don 't deny it i was under his spell !
i want you to get the boys
general de gaulle was a heavy smoker
one day he decided he 'd smoke no more
so he never smoked again
but i 'd announced it
answered you know with pride !
boys your father has never been what one would call an attentive father
often and until very recently he 's UNknown abandoned your mother and you
well those days are over !
tonight your father declares to you that you UNknown l have a father who will be here who will never be absent again !
a father who will be a father
i have not declared this to you out of vanity
i UNknown e declared this largely because i love you with all my heart
mama and both of you
sorry my dear i am
i 'm not blaming you but with you it all gets a little lost
you know it 's hard to follow you ?
it wouldn 't be me if anyone could follow me
i UNknown e never said that
etienne UNknown out does all of us
there 's genius in that man and i love him
esther you asked me to go and see your brother in law
i UNknown e seen him
esther you asked me to go and see your sister 's husband
i UNknown e seen him
everything you asked i UNknown e done
i UNknown l go no further !
stop UNknown with your tired games etienne says it stops
in your mind what does he represent ?
just the symbol of UNknown ?
is it important for you to imitate UNknown ?
no i don 't have that desire i have no sense of UNknown
as i UNknown e told you
i inquire all the time
i am not aiming for UNknown
i 'm much more of an inspector marlowe
that is to say intellectual UNknown
right now for example what are you inquiring about ?
i 'm inquiring about a murder !
esther you asked me to go and see your brother in law
i UNknown e seen him
you asked me to go and see your sister 's husband
he clearly is a UNknown being
a pathological liar it 's quite obvious
violent without hesitation but not a composed violence UNknown i 'd say
i UNknown l spare you the professional UNknown the post UNknown nonsense
i didn 't mean to have annoyed you with it !
he hasn 't told you everything
your sister 's killer is a complete madman
but his illness has a name
he 's called mu oz
can 't you leave me in peace ?
i tell you he 's dead mu oz !
died in a very bizarre accident !
there 's a new element all that money all those UNknown don 't really belong to uncle UNknown
it 's regrettable for mu oz
it 's regrettable for mu oz that they were UNknown in madrid
we 'r e going to see the hunchback
esther links us to UNknown court UNknown court to mu oz and mu oz to UNknown UNknown
you 'r e truly a coward !
i have no sister !
my sister is completely against the idea that intellectuals have no balls !
i may have no balls but i have children !
ah ! my dear i can 't help it
at my age and in my position these things happen
eh miss UNknown UNknown ?
i can 't say no
a minister of my country the minister of culture
a young man a very courteous boy very much requires me
professor do me the service of UNknown this committee
do me the honour i agreed
but i can still say no
in all decency you can not
we don 't sweat with decency miss UNknown UNknown !
you don 't know everything !
we 'r e bathing in the irrational !
i promised to go out less now that 's translated to no longer go out at all !
so what can i do ?

you know i have all your work but at my place in the countryside
i am a UNknown !
i kept horses for a long time

too much professor too much !
in the UNknown you wrote
i thought not but maybe that 's not so bad
imagination the less you have the better you UNknown l feel
i 'm not talking about books i 'm talking about in life
so in that way my niece esther has gone mad ?
she worries us that 's all
well so it seems !
we love her very much
but you shouldn 't get too attached to her sort !
as you know i have two
the older one the lawyer nothing to say
i don 't get her
in my farming days she 's what we called a UNknown mare
they 'r e the misery of the stable
i don 't tolerate them
with beasts it 's simple
but there are people who are the same as animals
for example i don 't know
for example that her brother in law killed her sister
you ask me therefore i answer
i UNknown l answer with the truth
his work 's UNknown and the UNknown of sex
i can tell you !
i loved the missing girl
but she was fragile to the core
a guy that passed by an UNknown she was taken by those things
sometimes children come back but she didn 't
fresh in the UNknown but not with the harness !
there 's someone else she 's UNknown on your fragile niece someone called mu oz
sirs i UNknown l show you out
one thing that upset our poor esther
her sister disappeared in london
i happened to be there on business
she disappeared in london the same day as he was found hanging from a bridge there
i see that sir keeps UNknown
i must say that these days big international business is hard !
it 's like the middle ages
if he says so he must know !
i see that you replaced your windows
gentlemen i will not detain you
one two three bags four five six seven a little piece of dior !
my poor darling i think you 'r e very tired
yes yes you 'r e tired
we 'r e going to go now
we UNknown l come back soon
etienne i UNknown l give her a kiss from you too ?
you say what i say ?
if you say it to yourself i must be able to say it to myself !
but he 's been warned the hunchback
if i take into account all his films we saw together
i remember you had a UNknown
you were UNknown in those days
you had the UNknown haircut
you also a big nose
i never had a big nose !
why were we talking about UNknown ?
my enthusiasm was UNknown on the central notion
this idea of a fragile little detective in the big hostile city
because a private detective is a cop but without the powers of the cop
it 's a helpless cop
you 'r e expecting us
it 's the second suite on the right
tell me was it an emergency ?
what 's he suffering from ?
don 't worry they 'r e not like you
they lack the mental UNknown
they don 't make a fuss
yes it 's very UNknown
about blood we went to see your uncle
result they beat up our friend 's girlfriend two hours later
but i didn 't ask you to !
we thought we were doing good !
you shouldn 't have !
we believed excuse us that you wanted us to look into it a bit
you fucked it up !
thanks for your sympathy !
if that 's it say it !
if that 's it you know we can move on to something else !
get them out of here !
go on go on !
put it through i UNknown l take it
how 's it going since yesterday ?
how amusing your friend is
so you two kept me from sleeping
i was thinking about my niece UNknown UNknown all night long
you have me reflecting your anxiety
sir it 's esther who interests me not the other one
the other the missing one i 'm indifferent about her
missing or murdered it 's not my problem and i 'm not involved !
about my niece UNknown UNknown
a name came back to me
i don 't have his address but you UNknown l find him in the geneva directory
won 't find him won 't be looking for him
all i will say is that my UNknown UNknown adored this UNknown
he was her sweetheart for a long time
but i can 't tell you to go to geneva
i surely won 't go to geneva
me i remain your humble your faithful admirer
are you going to geneva ?
i have nothing to do in geneva !
we have just landed in geneva
the ground temperature is 14 degrees UNknown
what 's with her ?
what 's with her !
she said she 's upset
it 's nothing my darling
we 'r e nearly there
stay cool my dear stay cool
listen mr officer you have before you both of our passports
we do not claim a universal fame but i hope for you
sit that the names contained therein will tell you a little something
from the french academy does that mean nothing to you either ?
i don 't want to be offensive but i would mention UNknown or UNknown
my name is UNknown my name is jean paul UNknown
don 't hit out like that
i UNknown l just send you for a UNknown
and then if that 's negative you can quietly go about your business
UNknown UNknown d UNknown court n e UNknown ?
honestly i UNknown e never seen her
i 'm thinking but it UNknown nothing
without wishing to offend i think that you are making a joke
it could be my son
my son paul mr UNknown junior
where would we find him ?
he 'd been a climber since he was a child
he was the king of rock climbing and then he came loose up in the UNknown
but his employees a secretary remain
names and addresses please ?
the next time believe me i UNknown l touch the hump !
what 's all this ?
what 's going on ?
what right have you ?
what 'r e they doing ?
i don 't know !
well it seems to remind him of something
he seems to have died every day somewhere or other !
but an accident i think ?
all those accidents stink !
you 'r e going to be of interest to interpol !
and two no less you 'r e on the run after the UNknown death !
what did you do ?
you knew this young UNknown ?
you expect a great man you get a little one
ok call paris check everything
UNknown suspect relationships real motives for the trip
so you 'r e better ?
you know i was never very ill
even at the clinic ?
oh no be careful !
it 's going well ?
a little UNknown with the move
well no dear i 'm still recovering
once a little but now nothing
a drink at my place ?
good news you 'r e not sought by interpol
nor you sidekick for that matter
ah that 's better !
especially for him i feared for him
when will we be released ?
maybe later in the day but don 't count your chickens yet !
another good thing the suspect from the airport the injured woman the drugs she was carrying were not real drugs
she was put on a plane to rome !
weep no more i bring you a snack
i don 't cry !
and you can have wine but that decision costs six cents
you make a complaint ?
no we know who it was
no you 'r e sweet
yes the windows it 's funny but i feel d UNknown could pose you big problems
what do you know ?
about their windows i wonder if it wasn 't you
a big thank you !
it meant being removed on an aircraft with 150 seats with the label hoodlum !
being looked down the nose at by 148 paranoid passengers !
thanks dear thanks switzerland !
i didn 't tell you to go !
knew you were irresponsible now you confirm it !
that was just the summary !
i UNknown e already been told
yes she had the cops on her back
still i didn 't tell her !
woke me up at UNknown with her UNknown
but it wasn 't a bother !
she 's right she had to lie too
she thought we were in brussels
don 't do that !
i brought UNknown but i wonder if they 'd be up to your usual
well that 's good !
two each that 's good
come don 't be shy !
do we scare you ?
come or go but do something !
it 's the house next door
is it very pressing ?
since this morning they 'r e out to get me !
you 'r e getting ideas if the employer ordered it they 'd have already killed you
i 'm left hanging just so they can laugh
what have you done for jocelyn ?
i meant the killers i haven 't said that it was jocelyn !
no you didn 't say it
the only small error i made was to drop that name
but we haven 't repeated it
we never said it was down to him
so someone else must have told him
perhaps without meaning any harm
you know where the coffee is ?
mu oz was it you ?
what do you want from me ?
admit that it was you it stays here between us
he died december 13th you were in madrid from the 8th
feel free to check i never set foot there
about the UNknown they 'r e a bit fresh i 'm going to toast some bread
idiot we 'r e not going to torture him
you UNknown e had a role in this nasty affair
she 's been put away twice
she has the UNknown to do it
mu oz knew it was you and not UNknown ?
there will be no more warning
it 's fine by me i don 't care but too many people at the top know
i can 't say yes
you 'r e well aware of how it is !
if you can 't say UNknown es say 'n o
i UNknown l know that means UNknown es !
i UNknown l spare your modesty that 's all
you see it 's easy !
where 's this going ?
you UNknown e got nothing
you UNknown e no human decency
i cried as much as you over UNknown UNknown
i am what i am you 'r e uncle too but you think i asked him to erase my wife ?
shit she 's family !
you know what 's waiting for me ?
madam don 't be offended i must speak to you
this is not the time
i know that you suffer
i cry for a nephew whom i loved as a son
i cry for the life of the UNknown of UNknown court murdered 3 days ago
the media have spoken a lot of it
but that boy that spirit !
paid with his life for the mad UNknown of one of the most eminent men of our time a great scholar your admirable husband
i won 't name him
i understand how you feel
i 'm sure you know my niece esther ?
well ma 'a m she is the cause of our UNknown
this kid she 's made your husband take leave of his senses
and it 's more serious there is a mutual fascination
it 's that dramatic !
not to UNknown you but she 's been locked up twice
how much has she involved him ?
is there still time ?
now ma 'a m it 's your turn
try to have him locked up !
otherwise keep away from him !
it 's for you i tremble
what 's he trying to tell me ?
i 'm telling you i UNknown e been thrown out of my place
i have no wife i have no children
i 'm 53 years old
yes that 's really tough
crushed by a UNknown who owes me everything
i struggle every night but enough is enough
i UNknown e come live with you
a tramp has come to live with you !
i know i 'm bothering you
not at all on the contrary
i UNknown l call reception they probably have another room
two bedrooms that would be better don 't you think ?
i 'm crushed i UNknown l do as i am told
crushed you like that eh ?
what i want right now is a shower
but what did has say the hunchback ?
in any case i UNknown l counter attack !
i UNknown l counter attack from all angles !
but in practice that means you doing what ?
don 't worry because between us by thinking in depth we cannot not find a way
turn on the light can 't see a thing
where did you get that ?
the only place you get UNknown in macao
take a trip coco !
you know how i see our relationship ?
i see myself as the latest pretty little housewife in the neighbourhood and you as the awful UNknown neighbour who 's trying to turn my head
it 's like that yes
you UNknown l have to try hard
what should i do now ?
is my virtue supposed to fall immediately or do i struggle a bit ?
what do you two want to say ?
it 's about your uncle
he 's in my sights
in believing himself very clever he may well sign his death warrant
social death that exists too !
you know left weekly ?
know how many readers ?
two hundred and fifty thousand !
we have a weapon but the truth it will hurt !
you know it will be fine
we see them tomorrow at UNknown
no do it without me
i UNknown e spent my life deceived by women !
i 'm not UNknown i 'm unhappy
i think of just one thing
geneva your wife all that
it wasn 't very perilous
why does the hunchback persist like that ?
it 's common among the sick
haven 't you ever seen a kid torturing flies ?
what is there to amuse him ?
the 6 butchered throughout europe by UNknown UNknown plus the UNknown himself
plus 4 my father my mother my uncle l UNknown my aunt marie
read this you UNknown l see that in the 2 cars the brakes had been sabotaged in the same manner and at the same location
how did you get this ?
i got it that 's all
it 's all so idiotic
what 's that dear etienne ?
at a close shave you 'd have had 14 !
mariella you have the draft cover ?
show it to mr UNknown please
we think she would be an asset !
i would suggest using our photographs but with 8 broken ribs 2 cracked UNknown and a sprained knee it won 't make them swoon
i agree with you nobody cares !
the UNknown that 's me
12 dead is considerable but we risk looking just UNknown
because a UNknown for profit as you say is still very vague
before leaving for london my sister left me the key to her safe
i have custody of UNknown documents
i see 1 who was a minister
you had all this and you did nothing ?
i needed it as a UNknown
only i didn 't realise it 's influence
they UNknown l back it all up !
she is a love !
it 's a pleasure to suffer for her
tell me dear last evening you didn 't want to come here right ?
if it had UNknown you 'd be dead and that would be awful so i UNknown e no choice i must use my proof
she is very UNknown !
i UNknown e never asked you
do you work for the UNknown lodge or for the vatican ?
so it 's for UNknown
i didn 't say that
miss seems to have drawn from the fact sir UNknown his profound faith that sir would find it UNknown to dip into the dirty work of the vatican
if i were miss i should deduce more from sir 's deep faith than from his association with the UNknown meaning UNknown
i admit however that if miss UNknown the UNknown lodge from the UNknown that would also be hazardous
has miss finally received news from madam the UNknown her sister ?
if i understand correctly he s advising you to make me disappear too ?
but you never really bothered me
i never imagined you could bore me so much
gen UNknown bothered you a lot ?
yes she was just too bright
so he had to killer her ?
she had to be crushed dear
but she didn 't suffer
it 's too late anyway
know where i UNknown e come from ?
yes i ve just been informed
they know what you know
sir means that his forest is dense
however the political complexion of these people does not give UNknown and i agree that a weekly UNknown paper cannot do him great harm
yet i wonder if sir should not be concerned with seeing this a little beyond the local level
all things considered i fear much less the inconvenience for sir 's affairs here than the deplorable impression given to sir 's friends elsewhere
will they like it ?
will they like it ?
as miss is sir 's niece and bears his own name won 't they reproach sir for failing to muzzle miss ?
yes they il know very quickly !
i think i understand miss
miss UNknown to destroy sir but it also seems that miss wants to give sir a chance
knowing sir 's silent partners a breed of UNknown usually blunt and very UNknown if i were sir
i think i should beat it !
i have the advantage to say sir is aware of how much i will miss him
miss may think i couldn 't care less but i have always thought sir very fine when he moves away like that deep in his own thoughts
my uncle 's not here ?
maybe it 's my wife ?
you UNknown l save more than your wedlock !
open up idiots it 's me !
4 died this afternoon on boulevard UNknown at a seemingly ordinary firm where a number of killers struck 3 it seems
when i say killers all signs show them to be professionals
among the victims a young lawyer ms muriel UNknown riot a lawyer working mainly in business the business concerns of her uncle jocelyn UNknown director of the firm
i 'm what they would call an impediment
if i were you i 'd weigh up the pros and cons
i must be at the funeral
that 's how it is with UNknown
not when they drag you into all sorts
they only rarely drag you into the cemetery
finally you are a very conventional
that 's what i tell myself too
the carton behind you it 's UNknown
a guy who makes cakes the day they murdered his wife you don 't think he deserves his UNknown ?
you think they UNknown l shoot the baker ?
you have a good night ?
i can 't thank you enough !
this is the best story in paris
i told you ! revealed in a rather different light this afternoon with the killing of 4 people at a very mysterious business office on boulevard UNknown
by chance it 's director jocelyn UNknown also seems to have disappeared just before the massacre
this morning a 5th death has occurred near paris at UNknown
so have you been making inquiries as to exactly what happened ?
yeah but firstly a word
i UNknown l say a word about the victim
we should talk about the execution
he was shot 8 times
but what 's particularly UNknown is that this execution happened less than a hundred yards from that of another deadly execution that of the UNknown of UNknown court UNknown
right it 's 7 UNknown
we 'r e going to take a break
with this boy was it ?
do you remember us both at UNknown UNknown de france ?
i remember you admired me
no i didn 't admire you
she 's waiting for us
there is no place in the world where you feel safer
wait until you see her place
it 's a chateau from the 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th century
it 's very old very beautiful
renata 's house is at the top
nothing can escape you you rule
you can 't imagine the grace the UNknown
you UNknown l see you UNknown l see
no one will ever find us !
it 's all burning !
if you know say it !
nobody knows what to say
i would say one thing
when it comes to me nothing stops her
she loves me enormously !
i 'm sure she is moving heaven and earth
you 'r e repeating yourself !
whether i repeat myself or not she has connections everywhere
in rome she is a queen
but it 's like that with all UNknown !
there 's also the innocents who get killed on armistice day !
i UNknown e been on lookout since midnight !
is it myself i fear ?
just before leaving you know what renata said ?
she 's done it !
a statement of guarantee !
i cannot tell you what it cost me !
they took me to a bank
there is no question !
that all powerful hand you always guarantee it ?
it 's very UNknown !
the fundamental UNknown is the existence of god !
if god exists it 's all good !
that all powerful hand you always guarantee it ?
it 's very UNknown !
the fundamental UNknown is the existence of god !
if god exists it 's all good !
it 's all good !
what if he flunked ?
i don 't want to see him
it 's been built that 's why
you 'r e as observant as dad
it wasn 't a big deai so we had it built
you don 't like it ?
don 't be silly woman
our boy 's so impressed he 's speechless
the dining room the living room and the kitchen
two bathrooms here and upstairs
the stairs are solid comfortable
come i UNknown l show you the upper floor
this can be your office
master bedroom with a back door
children 's room when you get married at last
and this will make a perfect guest room UNknown nice view
i 'm sure you and your wife will entertain a lot of important people
it 's internet ready and all
what 's the problem ?
the house can wait untii you decide
let him learn the ropes in the city
i 'm sure he will
let me tell you something my boy
she doesn 't have to be pretty
a horse has to be pretty
a woman has to be pure breed
we UNknown e got pretty horses
you 'r e sensitive and too UNknown
you do need a good match
he 's no longer a child
for the mother her son stays a child forever
alright we UNknown e had enough
let 's have a man to man conversation
we want the best for you
we just hoped to have you back soon
most children leave and start on their own
our neighbor 's got new dogs
you want to see the freak ?
it 's the archive miss
i 'm totally absent minded today
you UNknown l get stuck in traffic
there 's plenty to do at home
i may lose you under the UNknown
there 's not a single UNknown left and it 's about to begin !
serves you right for showing up on the wrong UNknown
and refusing st mary 's network !
i UNknown l tape it anyway !
on your pilgrimage video !
because you annoy the hell out of me !
where 's that UNknown ?
you UNknown l never find it
my guest is mr UNknown a member of parliament
we don 't want UNknown
it 's to avoid confusion
i 'd rather make my allegiance clear
your dinner 's in the kitchen ! for it might turn out that we not only represent UNknown UNknown
be quiet father 's on tv !
let 's get to the point
i consider these things essential
i had a sneezing fit again
are you sure you did the UNknown properly ?
we UNknown l have to check under the bedroom furniture there may be some dust left and it UNknown my nose
you were to get me the new pills
go get some UNknown from the shed
the nights are going to be cool they say
just be carefui not to bring back more dust or i UNknown l sneeze even worse
your preaching manner is better fit for the pulpit than the parliament !
the third republic you miss so much made this country the UNknown stable
look at your UNknown leg
and they will zoom in on it on purpose
to punish you for your UNknown
this room is a disaster
the books gather dust and UNknown my UNknown
why don 't you get rid of those you UNknown e read ?
you UNknown e no business here
it was your study when you wrote
now it 's more like a UNknown hall
our savings are UNknown we UNknown l have to borrow from my parents
don 't stick in here if you won 't write
oh and the shed roof leaks
come out will you ?
maybe i 'm allergic to you ?
perhaps you UNknown UNknown smoke in secret ?
it 's so dusty in here
the sun brings it out
i 'm fixing the roof
it 's a few hours work
don 't take too long
what do you mean ?
like when you were invited to give lectures
i don 't want to be alone
i left the UNknown behind in my office again
watch your mistress ok ?
did i sleep long ?
a few moments as usual
then you don 't know what happened ?
i wasn 't even there
i was in my study
perhaps you were watching the news
i don 't remember anything
my neck 's bothering me
because you slept on the floor
let me make an appointment with the doctor for tomorrow
it 's been quite a while since he last saw you
who were you UNknown ?
i was setting the alarm that 's all
you UNknown e changed the password ?
darling give me the phone ok ?
i need to know who you UNknown
you should take your pills
why are you cheating on me ?
am i not good enough ?
i don 't want to fall asleep
the moment i go to sleep
and when you wake up do you
yes you 'r e right
i recommend peace and quiet and a well ordered life
try to avoid extreme UNknown states
i 'm sick and tired of peace
i 'm grounded here round the clock !
i want to live go back to work !
no such option yet i 'm afraid
you 'r e too vulnerable
you might fall asleep again
at the least desirable moment
but i want to be among people
this silence is head splitting
the time 's not ripe yet
it 's a shame you UNknown to depression
you have a caring husband a wonderfui home
doctor is it UNknown to have a UNknown dream again and again even though you don 't want it ?
what kind of dream is haunting you ?
that my husband is a goddamn son of a bitch
we must bring her body clock into line
she should sleep all night
i make sure she takes her pills
if she fails i give her a shot
UNknown is still a bit of a mystery
your wife 's UNknown is that she has no recollection of the moments prior to falling asleep
she does experience strong emotions only to wake up with a blank mind
thus she 's always thrill hungry but once she UNknown her desire she goes to sleep and the cycle repeats itself
if this UNknown she UNknown l never come back to the stage
took longer than i thought
was it worth it ?
i want this toy mommy !
it 's a hospital right ?
i UNknown l take care of it
was it worth it ?
you UNknown e got to live right ?
having a high risk job you should get insured
we UNknown l put your arm in a cast bandage the broken ribs
no UNknown for the time being
i have a tournament next week !
what the heck are you doing ?
no respect for public property
i don 't smoke i 'm afraid
where 's this one from ?
they don 't like strangers on the block !
father has buried the hatchet
we agreed to respect your choices
the house can wait until you 'r e ready
now tell us when we could come to see you
we 'd bring you some goodies
i 'd do some cleaning ironing
i 'm sure you have no time to take care of that
when can we visit you ?
we can 't have sex you know
no you 'r e not
besides there are ways not to get pregnant
you 'r e the limit
you 'r e such a nag
have you written anything today ?
what else is new ?
ever since i started sleeping with you i haven 't had dreams
are you sure you 'r e all right ?
you 'r e not quite yourself
a life without sleep is pointless
you 'r e not sleepy don 't sleep
try to write something !
i want to read in bed
they left out your name ?
my dear certain messages are better voiced UNknown so that people can accept them as their own
are you short of ideas ?
i can 't write pure and simple
don 't be a crybaby !
get a grip on yourself and get to work !
or else we UNknown l have to support you
i 'm sorry i can 't
my words have worn out
i just want to tell you that i know your books
i UNknown e read them secondhand
i UNknown e read about you
there was a lot in the papers
by the way what do you do in this basement ?
you 'r e writing something ?
my father in law who else ?
for spying on me huh ?
to hear that i peek at ladies panties instead of writing
he 's done that before to check if i 'm working
what really matters is finding a good UNknown point
do you see this window ?
for two years i UNknown e been UNknown the world through it
did you see who passed by ?
how would i know ?
she 's going to an exam
in a navy blue high schooi skirt
it 's her third attempt
her friends are already done so for the first time she 's alone
her UNknown is usually like this
she UNknown l plant her heels down first
UNknown click UNknown the sidewalk
when she flunked her UNknown became uncertain
a drink or two to forget ?
what about this guy ?
walking back from work ?
he lost his job recently
when he worked he walked twice as fast
now they UNknown e lost their UNknown
i bet his shave is uneven
please give it to my father in law
it 's my new novel
i didn 't have to make up stories
i watched and drew conclusions
as time went by the apparent chaos began to fall into patterns
some legs would pass by always at the same time
i started to recognize people by their UNknown
details became important shoes and pants runs in UNknown
it seems that human lives resemble one another
i learned to tell people 's ups and downs from their legs
i started using index cards to keep my records in order and not to leave out any pair of legs
letters symbols for words UNknown for sentences
the idea was not to miss anything and to elaborate on it sometime later at leisure
but i UNknown e lost my zeal
i 'm ashamed to be polish
how can you say that ?
ignore those UNknown that 's all they deserve
he 's not into sports
twenty two men running around and thousands of suckers cheering !
those twenty two make money
a pile of shit !
i found him this cozy job for what ?
he chooses to UNknown in a pad to kill the time !
what 's his idea of providing for you ?
you wanted a creative son in law !
and forbid me to shack up !
don 't talk to father like that !
we take a beating from everybody on this planet
we UNknown l screw up every game !
it needs to be replaced !
you should see a doctor
how are you today ?
i 'm brushing up on my lines
everything 's there in my mind
i just need to access it again
i 'm hungry like a dog
better pour in some wine
the UNknown is on the table
aren 't UNknown poisonous ?
have i ever made you sick ?
that 's the fly mushroom slightly toxic but UNknown
not available in any restaurant
a patch of forest can feed a division
don 't you get it ?
i can 't talk now
i keep dreaming you have a lover
am i to apologize for your dreams ?
you 'r e crazy !
you 'r e not supposed to get upset
i don 't know and i don 't care
i don 't want to fall asleep !
i 'm working long hours today
lock the door if you want to go out
they beat the living shit out of me
i only had small change
please send an ambulance 1 UNknown
they UNknown l be right here
setting a new duty hours record ?
alright let 's go !
are you sure it 's here ?
this is what i have
what a slum house !
we UNknown e been told you 'r e off today so we 'r e here with some goodies !
you UNknown e started a private practice
he 's not there let 's go
he 's not there i said
you bought it or you stole it ?
you go through my pockets ?
why are you iying to me ?
your gang beat a man badly
i should report it to the police !
hey what 's your problem ?
what the fuck do you want ?
the news isn 't good
i warned you last time the problem was serious
the only option left at this stage is UNknown UNknown
there 's no knowing if it UNknown l work
your immune system is weakened
but you must fight whatever it takes
i don 't want my family to know
would it be on an UNknown basis ?
i should UNknown you right now
is there any point ?
what 's there to win ?
you mustn 't say that
is there any chance for me to get well ?
i feei like i UNknown e slept through something
i was silly enough to marry a toxic woman i probably never loved
i hoped that i had at least half a lifetime to go
that i would make a new start someday
and now this bolt out of the blue
i didn 't live the way i wanted to
maybe at least i UNknown l die my way
no rush take your time
how long will i live without treatment ?
my wife suffers from hysteria
she can hardly tolerate my not being around
i need to prepare her
you need to have the will to live
it 's going to be an extreme experience
final to put it bluntly
you 'r e sneaking around like a ghost
whose scent is it ?
don 't ruin the day
you might pass out and i must go
why are you doing this to me ?
you insult me and don 't even remember it later on
that 's what they call getting up on the wrong side of the bed
i UNknown l be back as usual
your order ma 'a m
your dog will have a feast
it 's for my husband
please listen and don 't get upset
i 'm stuck in the office
i may be very late sorry
now i can see through it all
what 's the matter with you ?
i filled in for you yesterday but that 's it you UNknown e got to come back

but don 't fall asleep
we 'r e to visit grandpa 's grave with my parents
we 'r e already late !
can 't you have the money ready for once ?
what do you mean ?
my name on the tomb
i told you didn 't i ?
it 's dad 's gift for us
that 's what people do
they just add death dates when the time comes
then i 'm standing over my own tomb ?
we 'r e all mortal
thanks to dad we UNknown l be resting together
you 'r e always taking things so personally !
so you 'r e running a business !
it 's a bit slow though
corporate events keep me going
and what do you want ?
we UNknown l have to wait
i don 't mean today
oh my god are you all right ?
i 'm out of breath
when my husband comes back he can give you a ride
i 'm not supposed to get upset
you remember me from the theater ?
i know where you work but
i UNknown e never been there
frankly it 's the first time i can see all of you
that premiere must have been a success
you walked happily barefoot shoes in hand accompanied by the same man as usual
it was the last i saw of you
i dozed off and crashed my car
amazing how much you know
i UNknown e got to go
please stay untii my husband 's back
i 'm always alone isolated from the world
it 's good listening to you
the man who kept you company
is he your current husband ?
what do you mean current ?
have you seen him again ?
you know something about him ?
come on tell me !
please be honest with me
robert was passing by and felt ill
let 's drive him home
i don 't want to inconvenience you
i UNknown l just get a coat
we 'r e not alone
my husband believes i shouldn 't leave this place
it 's no joke honey
you 'r e not well
apparently nobody 's that well
what spice did you add ?
you 'r e one of a kind
do we have any cold soda ?
your UNknown is drying up
what wine goes with it ?
what did you give me ann ?
sweet ann i 'm your man !
you UNknown e met her though you don 't remember
she 's jealous of you
she can 't believe that when you get aroused UNknown you go to sleep !
she rushed in once you froze
what are you doing here ? i ask
UNknown her you did fall asleep and couldn 't remember a thing !
i 'm tired of you sleeping and her making scenes
i wish i could get away from it all
i UNknown e no time for myself !
it 's either you or her
plus i 'm not to stress you
if only i could live my way !
have one sweater UNknown the oceans fish for UNknown
i 'm wasting my breath you 'r e asleep again !
that when you get aroused UNknown you go to sleep !
what are you doing here ? i ask
UNknown her you did fall asleep and couldn 't remember a thing !
she rushed in once you froze
what are you doing here ? i ask
you UNknown e met her though you don 't remember
you wanted to kill me
that small dose was only supposed to stop you iying
how come you can listen to it ?
how could you do it to me ?
i probably don 't love you anymore
we UNknown l take the last bus
just out of town it gets empty
hey give us a break !
we 'r e going to the tournament
we UNknown e played the same game for years and you fuckin change sides ? !
who the fuck is he ?
you hang around with a fag !
can 't do that !
leave him the fuck alone !
who did you dream about ?
rose isn 't my name
apparently you were in my dream as another woman
what about your wife ?
soon she UNknown l have to learn to live without me
what a UNknown UNknown !
i dreamt about your shoes next to mine
with you around me i feei i 'm living again
it looks like your fits were caused by UNknown and not amnesia
you wouldn 't admit that you were cheated on and used the illness as a crutch
this way you felt your husband would stick around longer
that turned out to be a no win situation
but i 'm also glad the worst should now be behind us
you can live with UNknown
depression is more of a problem
like i UNknown e UNknown up a stone
i don 't deserve forgiveness
but be aware that i regret it
i forgive you for being unfaithful
but not for iying to me
let 's keep the door open
is that all you came up with ?
are you going somewhere ?
trying to be funny ?
what are you talking about ?
what 's the matter with you ?
you 'r e out all saturday without my permission
now you UNknown e packed
what is it all about ?
you think it 's as simple as that ?
you think i deserve it ?
i 'm not leaving you
how do i explain ?
you must be out of your mind
i intended to do it for ten years to UNknown change my life
to pack my stuff and leave
but there was always a reason not to
i pitied you UNknown UNknown you loved me
i thought i loved you too i felt guilty i was too lazy
to lift mr UNknown 's immunity due to charges of sexual UNknown
lodged by his former secretaries
what 's going on here ?
what are you up to moron ?
even if he wins the case his political career is doomed
is this for real ?
we UNknown l make it big message boards a promotion tour
with you in the spotlight again it UNknown l be a UNknown
don 't worry about promotion
i UNknown l handle it myself
i UNknown l be in the stable
you 'r e getting better
how 's our celebrity doing ?
all he needs is peace and quiet
i don 't want to go to hell
first thing in hell they show you all your missed opportunities
how your life would have been if you had made the right choices
then you see the moments of happiness wasted when you were asleep
and what your life would have been like had you UNknown in time
then you 'r e left alone for eternity
there 's nobody and nothing
alright UNknown let 's review the case
built in 1939 home to numerous ghost UNknown and attacks
janet meyers she was an inspiring actress
she was attending a UNknown party at the theatre
carved her face up with a razor
made her watch the whole thing in the mirror
repeated UNknown violence eventually shut the place down
the guys seem to really like her
there was something that happened during our last mission
and you know he 's he is my brother 's best friend so that 's bad for the team
what did he say ?
that what she said ?
alright team we got 2 hours till sundown
i want all gear and personnel ready to deploy by UNknown
as the UNknown prepare to re enter the darkness
we pay homage to a team mate that has crossed into the light
who we UNknown l never forget
hey you parked here ?
two hour parking buddy it 's a 50 ticket
five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
five hundred twenty five thousand moments so dear
five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
how do you measure measure a year ?
in UNknown in cups of coffee
in five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
how do you measure a year in the life ?
five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
five hundred twenty five thousand journeys to plan
five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
how do you measure the life of a woman or a man ?
in truths that she learned ?
or in times that he cried ?
in bridges he burned ?
or the way that she died ?
it 's time now to sing out
though the story never ends
let 's celebrate remember a year in the life of friends
oh you got to you got to remember the love
you know that love is a gift from up above
share love give love spread love
measure measure your life in love
measure your life measure your life in love
december 24th UNknown 9 p m eastern standard time
from here on in i shoot without a script
see if anything comes of it instead of my old shit
i said get off the window
how do you document real life
when real life 's getting more like fiction each day ?
headlines bread lines blow my mind
how do you write a song when the chords sound wrong ?
though they once sounded right and rare
when the notes are sour where is the power
you once had to UNknown the air ?
we 'r e hungry and frozen some life we UNknown e chosen
how we gonna pay ?
how we gonna pay ?
how we gonna pay how we gonna pay
last year 's rent ?
hey guess who 's back in town
get that son of a bitch
how do you start a fire when there 's nothing to burn
and it feels like something 's stuck in your UNknown ?
how can you generate heat when you can 't feel your feet
and they 'r e turning blue ?
and they 'r e turning blue ?
you light up a mean blaze
how we gonna pay ?
how we gonna pay ?
how we gonna pay ?
how we gonna pay ?

and tonight it 's trick ?
welcome back to town oh i should lie down
everything 's brown and uh oh i feel sick
how we gonna pay ?
how we gonna pay ?
how we gonna pay ?
last year 's rent ?
the music UNknown the night with passionate fire
the UNknown UNknown and pops with incendiary wit
zoom in as they burn the past to the ground
and feel the heat of the future 's glow
how do you leave the past behind
when it keeps finding ways to get to your heart ?
it reaches way down deep and tears you inside out
till you 'r e torn apart rent
how can you connect in an age where strangers landlords lovers
your own blood cells betray ?
what binds the fabric together
when the raging shifting winds of change keep ripping away ?
draw a line in the sand and then make a stand
use your camera to UNknown use your guitar
when they act tough you call their bluff
we 'r e not gonna pay
we 'r e not gonna pay
we 'r e not gonna pay
rent rent rent rent rent
we 'r e not gonna pay rent
get your ass off the range rover
benny that attitude toward the homeless is exactly what maureen is protesting
maureen is protesting iosing her performance space not my attitude
our ex roommate who married UNknown grey of the UNknown UNknown
his father in iaw bought severai buildings on the block and a nearby vacant iot home to tent city
benny hopes to evict aii of the homeless from tent city and build a UNknown studio
roger you 'r e iooking good for a guy coming off of a year of withdrawal
what do you want benny ?
read about maureen 's performance in the village voice

how is the drama queen ?
thanks for being so understanding
you expect sympathy from the guy who shut off our power on christmas eve ?
got your attention didn 't it ?
what happened to benny ?
what happened to his heart and the ideals he once pursued ?
any owner of that lot next door has a right to do with it as he pleases
the rent you 'r e wasting your time
we 'r e broke you broke your word this is absurd
there is one way you won 't have to pay
next door the home of UNknown
and now that the block is UNknown our dream can become a reality
you UNknown l see boys
you UNknown l see boys
a state of the art UNknown UNknown UNknown studio
i UNknown l UNknown your rent and on paper guarantee
that you can stay here for free
convince maureen to UNknown her protest
why not just get an injunction or caii the cops ?
i did and they 'r e on standby
but my investors would rather i handle this quietly
you can 't quietly wipe out an entire tent city then watch it 's a wonderful life on tv
you wanna produce films and write songs ?
you need somewhere to do it
it 's what we used to dream about think twice before you pooh pooh it
you UNknown l see boys
you UNknown l see boys
you UNknown l see the beauty of a studio
that lets us do our work and get paid
with UNknown on the top whose rent keeps open our shop
just stop the protest and you UNknown l have it made
or you 'i i pack
did they get anything or ?
i didn 't have any money but they took my stuff
let 's get you cleaned up
i sort of have to hurry
i have a life support meeting
it 's for people with UNknown
i was gonna go try to find coilins
i thought maybe we could aii grab some dinner
i 'm writing one great song before i
one song before i go
glory one song to leave behind
glory from the pretty boy front man
one song he had the world at his feet
glory in the eyes of a young girl
beyond the cheap colored lights
in a song that rings true truth like a blazing fire
a song about love glory
from the soul of a young man
find the one song before the virus takes hold
what 'd you forget ?
i know you you 'r e
it 's nothing they turned off my heat
and i 'm just a little weak on my feet would you light my candle ?
your hair in the moonlight

just haven 't eaten much today
your smile reminded me of i always remind people of
her name was april it 's out again

i know i UNknown e seen you out and about
when i used to go out

they say that i have the best ass below 1 4th street
you 'r e staring again oh no
i mean you do have a nice
i mean you look familiar
like your dead girlfriend only when you smile
but i 'm sure i UNknown e seen you somewhere else
do you go to the cat scratch club ?
yes they used to tie you up
i didn 't recognize you without the handcuffs
we could light the candle
oh won 't you light the candle ?
why don 't you forget that stuff
you look like you 'r e 16 i 'm 19
but i 'm old for my age i 'm just born to be bad
i once was born to be bad i used to shiver like that
i have no heat i told you i used to sweat
i got a cold uh huh i used to be a junkie
but now and then i like to feel good uh huh
oh here what 's that ?
we could light the candle
oh what 'd you do with my candle ?
that was my last match our eyes UNknown l adjust
thank god for the moon maybe it 's not the moon at all
big like my father 's
do you wanna dance ?
no with my father i 'm roger
mark are you there ?
are you screening your calls ?
i just wanted to call and say we love you
we UNknown l miss you today
cindy and the kids are here
hope you like the hot plate
don 't leave it on when you leave the house
honey give me the phone
listen mark i 'm sorry to hear that maureen dumped you
i say c UNknown st la vie
let her be a UNknown
you know there are times when we 'r e dirt broke and hungry and freezing and i ask myself why the heii am i stiii iiving here ?
oh the dancer from the cat scratch club ?
yeah 1 4 hours iater
what the heii happened to you ?
are you aii right ?
oh hi after seven months ?
you know what you need ?
they UNknown me for my theory of UNknown reality
i got a teaching gig at UNknown
gentlemen our benefactor on this christmas day
whose charity is only matched by talent i must say
a new member of the alphabet city UNknown garde
today for you tomorrow for me
today for you tomorrow for me
and you should hear her beat you earned this on the street ?
it was my lucky day today on avenue a
when a lady in a limousine drove my way
she said darling be a dear haven 't slept in a year
i need your help to make my neighbor 's UNknown dog disappear
this akita UNknown just won 't shut up i believe if you play UNknown
that pup will breathe its very last high strung breath
i 'm certain that cur will bark itself to death
today for you tomorrow for me
today for you tomorrow for me
we agreed on a fee 1000 guarantee tax free
and a bonus if i trim her tree
now who could foretell that it would go so well ?
but sure as i am here that dog is now in doggy hell
after an hour UNknown in all her glory
on the window ledge of that 23rd story
like thelma and louise did when they got the blues
swan dove into the courtyard of the gracie UNknown
today for you tomorrow for me
today for you tomorrow for me
back on the street where i met my sweet
where he was moaning and groaning on the cold concrete
the nurse took him home for some UNknown
then i dressed his wounds and got him back on his feet
sing it today for you
today for you tomorrow for me
i say today for you
look i have a bit of a problem
i really need your help
i hired joanne as my production manager and i don 't think she knows what the hell she 's doing
can you believe her ?
i mean first she just dumps me
for a iawyer named joanne
now she wants me to help her fix her sound equipment
weil mark you could UNknown e said no
some people don 't have anywhere else to go today
it 's not just for people with UNknown
i 'm just playing with you boy
maureen cailed me to try to come help fix the equipment
maureen said she 'd be here
weil don 't hold your breath
can i help anyway ?
weil nice to have met you then
he 's three hours iate
the samples won 't delay but the cable
there 's another way say something anything
this is weird it 's weird
i 'm so mad that i don 't know what to do
fighting with UNknown freezing down to my bones
and to top it all off i 'm with you
feel like going insane ?
got a fire in your brain ?
and you 'r e thinking of drinking gasoline ?
as a matter of fact honey i know this act
it 's a dark dizzy merry go round
as she keeps you dangling you 'r e wrong
your heart she is UNknown it 's different with me
and you toss and you turn
cause her cold eyes can burn
yet you yearn and you UNknown and rebound
have you ever doubted a kiss or two ?
did you swoon when she walked through the door ?
every time so be cautious
did she moon over other boys ?
more than moon i 'm getting UNknown
where 'd you iearn to tango ?
with the french ambassador 's daughter in her room at miss porter 's
with UNknown UNknown the rabbi 's daughter at the UNknown jewish community center
it 's hard to do this backwards
you should try it in heels
i 'm defeated i should give up right now
gotta look on the bright side with all of your might
i 'd fall for her still anyhow
when you 'r e dancing her dance you don 't stand a chance
her grip of romance makes you fall
so you think might as well dance a tango to hell
gotta dance till your UNknown is through
you pretend to believe her
cause in the end you can 't leave her
but the end it will come still you have to play dumb
till you 'r e glum and you bum and turn blue
why do we love when she 's mean ?
actuaily i feei great now
okay everyone iet 's begin
first i just want to welcome you ail
oh i 'm not i don 't have
weil this is quite an operation
does anyone have a problem if i film a iittle of this for a documentary ?
who wants to begin ?
yesterday i found out my t UNknown were iow
how are you feeling today ?
then why choose fear ?
i 'm a new yorker
look i find some of what you teach suspect
because i 'm used to relying on intellect
but i try to open up to what i don 't know
because reason says i should have died
or life is yours to miss
what 's the time ?
well it 's gotta be close to midnight
my body 's talking to me it says time for danger
it says i wanna commit a crime
wanna be the cause of a fight
i wanna put on a tight skirt
and flirt with a stranger
i UNknown e had a knack from way back
at breaking the rules once i learn the game
get up life 's too quick i know someplace sick
where this chick UNknown l dance in the flames
we don 't need any money
i always get in for free
you can get in too
if you get in with me
we won 't be back before it 's new year 's day
when i get a wink from the doorman
do you know how lucky you UNknown l be ?
that you 'r e on the line
with the UNknown of avenue b
be my night owl ?
in the evening i UNknown e got to roam
can 't sleep in the city of neon and UNknown
feels too damn much like home
when the spanish babies cry
so let 's find a bar
so dark we forget who we are
where all the scars from the nevers and UNknown die
you 'r e sweet wanna hit the street ?
wanna wail at the moon like a cat in heat ?
who do you think you are ?
barging in on me and my guitar
little girl hey the door is that way
you better go you know the fire 's out anyway
take your powder take your candle
your sweet whisper i just can 't handle
well take your hair in the moonlight
your brown eyes goodbye good night
i should tell you i should tell you
i should tell you i should no
our temperature would climb there 'd be a long embrace
we 'd do another dance it 'd be another play
or life is yours to miss
excuse me if i 'm off track
but if you 'r e so wise then tell me
why do you need smack ?
don 't forget get the moonlight out of your hair
long ago you might have lit up my heart
but the fire 's dead ain 't never ever gonna start
the words would only rhyme we 'd be in outer space
it 'd be another song we 'd sing another way
you wanna prove me wrong ?
to know what 's right
who says that there 's a soul ?
who do you think you are ?
there 's only now there 's only here
barging in on me and my guitar give in to love or live in fear
little girl hey no other path
the door is that way no other way
the fire 's out anyway
take your powder take your candle
take your brown eyes your pretty smile your UNknown
another time another place another rhyme a warm embrace
mark roger it 's benny
look you still got a few hours to stop maureen 's protest
look about iast night i don 't wanna talk about it
you know mimi 's gonna be at maureen 's show tonight
i 'd hate to see you pass up something that could be good for you
you 'i i only regret it

about iast night i 'm sorry
i don 't know what the just forget it
i was out of iine
bunch of us are getting together tonight
last night i had a dream
i found myself in a desert cailed UNknown
my canteen had sprung a UNknown and i was thirsty
i 'm forbidden to produce milk
gotta get out of here
it 's like i 'm being tied to the hood of a yellow rental truck
being packed in with fertilizer and fuel oil
pushed over a cliff by a suicidal mickey mouse
gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta
gotta gotta find a way
to jump over the moon
then a iittle UNknown entered
his name we have iearned was benny
and although he once had principles he abandoned them to iive as a UNknown to a wealthy daughter of the revolution
a one two three that 's bull he said
ever since the cat took up the fiddle that cow 's been jumpy
the dish and the spoon were evicted from the table and eloped
she 's had trouble with that milk and the moon ever since
maybe it 's a female thing
cause who 'd wanna leave UNknown anyway ?
walls ain 't so bad
the dish and the spoon for instance they 'r e down on their luck
they come UNknown on my doghouse door
and i say not in my back yard UNknown
and i UNknown myself beneath her UNknown UNknown and i sucked the sweetest milk i had ever tasted
and as a harvest moon rose over UNknown we reared back we sprang into a UNknown UNknown out of orbit
leap of faith leap of faith
leap of faith leap of faith
only thing to do is jump
only thing to do is jump over the moon
only thing to do is jump over the moon
take it easy aii right ?
benny got exactly what he wanted
he screws up my show he gets aii these people arrested
cops won 't hold them for iong
they 'i i iet them go in a few hours
wait where 's mark ?
i don 't know man
are you aii right ?
tonight on the 1 1 00 news the iead story is gonna be your show
how do you know that ?
they bought my footage of the riot
how can i repay you ?
you sit here aii night and you never order anything
last week i had a tea

protector against the forces of evil
he can catch a bullet faster than a speeding train
he leaps tall buildings in a single bound
is it a bird is it a plane ? mailman by day superhero by night
he protects new york from the forces of evil
the world has been protected by extraordinary men and women who have dedicated themselves to fighting crime
he has powers far beyond the UNknown of mere UNknown
i always wondered why nobody did it before me
you 'd think that one eccentric UNknown would have made himself a costume
is everyday life really so exciting are schools and offices so thrilling that i m the only one who ever UNknown about this ?
at some point in our lives we all wanted to be a super hero
that 's not me by the way
that 's some UNknown guy with a history of mental health problems
back before any of this crazy shit happened
guess i was the last person you 'd expect to become a superhero
not saying there was anything wrong with me
but there 's not nothing special either
i wasn 't into sports
i wasn 't a UNknown or a hard core UNknown
i didn 't have a piercing or an eating disorder or three thousand friends on UNknown
my only UNknown was being invisible to girls
but out of my friends man i wasn 't even the funny one
like most people my age i just existed
please open your books to act il scene ii
kick in my bedroom door you UNknown d probably find me watching tv
or talking to my friend todd on UNknown
me neither try UNknown com it 's good
mostly to my english teacher
david UNknown don 't think i haven 't noticed you looking at my tits ?
oh ! i want your hand all over me dave please
sure a lot of what got me through the average school day was making deposits in the UNknown off warehouse for later
though to be honest i didn 't take much to set me off
shouldn 't you be looking at hamlet right now ?
but don 't make me wrong
i like girls in my own age too
o k cool oh my god
hey look i 'm todd 's mom
oh that 's funny this is your dad
no that 's still my mom actually what the fuck ?
i was just a regular guy
no refugee status from a doomed alien world
todd said they do still make count UNknown
they just don t sell it in the store anymore
my mother was killed by an UNknown in the kitchen as opposed to a gunman in an alley
so if you were hoping for any
i will avenge you mother ! you 'r e outta luck
in fact in the eighteen months since my mother died the only UNknown i had was realizing that life just goes on
how come nobody 's ever tried to be a superhero ? well i dunno
probably cause it 's fucking impossible dip shit
what putting on a mask and helping people ?
how is that impossible ?
that 's not a superhero though
it has to have super
super is like being stronger than everybody and flying and shit
he didn 't have any powers
yeah but he had all expensive shit that doesn 't exist
i thought you meant like how come no one does it in real life
yeah todd that 's what i meant
dude if anybody did it in real life they 'd get their ass kicked
they 'd be dead in like a day a day
o k i 'm not saying they should do it
i just can t figure out why nobody does
doesn 't it bug you ?
why do thousands of people wanna be paris hilton and nobody wants to be spider man ?
yeah what 's with that ?
she has like no tits at all
maybe it 's the porn tape
he doesn 't have a porn tape
you never saw one night in spider man ?
is it just me or do you feel kinda sorry for chris d 'a UNknown ?
yeah must be terrible to have a rich dad and everything you want
i wish you hadn 't said anything
UNknown UNknown i feel like i 'm gonna start crying
no the fact that it
yeh but he 's always on his own
we should like talk to him
see if he wants to hang with us
i 'm not saying that we should talk to him but
c 'm on it d be awesome !
if he was our friend no one would ever fuck with us again !
no no what you mean ?
do not be afraid dave
wanna go over there ? yeah
yeah i would just UNknown his ass
when did you ever kick anyone 's ass ?
whatever man i would UNknown e just gone for his knees
you are not making sense
what i 'm saying is that in the joker portion when he got in UNknown when he vowed to penetrate the joker 's force field leaving him totally vulnerable
i don 't have one !
you wanna get cut ?
look at this asshole just watching
come on be honest with yourself would you do anything differently
we see someone in trouble and we wish we can help
the world i lived in heroes only exist in comic books
but i guess that would have been ok if bad guys were make believe too
i swear i 'm not making this up
comes outta nowhere kicks our asses steals all the coke
this would be the guy that looks like batman
i didn 't say look like batman
you said the the guy looked like batman
and you said like a mask and stuff and a cape ?
let me tell you the problem i got with that tre
our mole with the russians tells things a little different
according to him you UNknown e sold him my coke and you took the money
that 's a fucking lie !
i can 't believe that you would believe this shit from a fucking russian man
what 's more likely ?
that you 'r e a greedy little UNknown
my son is waitin out there in the car to go to the movies
and i UNknown gonna to disappoint him
joe you 'r e in charge
sorry you had to wait buddy
the movie is starting in 10 minutes
it 's o k we 'r e cool
we 'r e only gonna miss the UNknown
yeah but i wanted to get some popcorn
what do you wanna drink wanna UNknown ?
like when they mix the red one and the blue one ?
and a pack of UNknown
the comic books had it wrong
it didn 't take a trauma or cosmic rays or a power ring to make a superhero
just the perfect combination of optimism and UNknown
c 'm on mindy honey
be a big girl now
there 's nothin to be afraid of
is it gonna hurt bad ? oh child
only for a second sugar
UNknown bullet travels at more than ?
so at close range like this the force is gonna take you off your feet for sure
but it 's really no more painful than a punch in the chest
i hate getting punched in the chest
you 'r e gonna be fine baby doll
now you know how it feels you won 't be scared when some junkie asshole pulls a UNknown
wouldn 't have been scared anyways
that 's my girl ! UNknown ay
only if we can go by the bowling alley on the way back
two more rounds no UNknown no whining and you got yourself a deal young lady
i 'm gonna get hot fudge UNknown
good call baby doll !
so you gonna tell a little more about what you might want for your birthday ?
can i get a puppy ?
and a UNknown UNknown UNknown sasha
just fucking with you daddy !
you always knock me for a loop
i 'm gonna get you two
that 's what you get
i UNknown l be honest there wasn 't a whole lotta crime fighting in those first few weeks
but even so my new vocation kept me plenty busy
but if you called it UNknown it woulda been hard to argue
okay maybe i was still in the beta testing phase
but it was a start
get the fuck out of here
like every serial killer already knew eventually UNknown just doesn t do it for you anymore
it was time to engage
what the fuck are you looking at ?
i said what the fuck are you looking at ?
two UNknown losers screwing with a car that somebody probably worked their ass off to pay for
this motherfucker is obviously high
i just think it sucks you guys think you can do what you want
just walk away from the car and we can just forget about it
i came out just long enough to beg the medics not to tell anybody about the costume
he promised he wouldn 't
all i knew was that my dad was gonna kill me
why can not i get a gun ?
i am the security guard
you 'r e a doorman now
you don 't get a gun no more
i look like a UNknown
look at all them buttons
frank we got a thing
sorry for the very do what you gotta do
chris where you think you 'r e going ?
where do you think you 'r e going ?
i was just gonna sit in there quietly
i mean i should probably start learning and stuff anyway right ?
so what 's the problem ?
our russian says tre just sold them another 5 k 's at half price
so now i 'm getting fucked in the ass by a ghost
or tre was telling the truth
what so this is my choice ?
i have to believe in ghosts or UNknown ?
not the part about the superhero franky
just that he UNknown really been UNknown by somebody
i think we better invited our russian friend over for a friendly chat

that you don 't even fucking know ?
you 'r e just three UNknown laying into one guy while everyone else watches
and you wanna know what 's wrong with me ?
yeah i 'd rather die
you bring it on !!
welcome to this special edition of eye on new york
how far would you go to help your fellow man ?
this UNknown covered individual has been all over the news this week
after this video of his intervention of street gang violence became the most watched web on the internet
on my space 38 press
kick ass is my favorite
this thing was going crazy
and i was loving it
finally we want to know who is this man
does anyone have any idea who this wet suit UNknown is ?
he must be someone 's son
what happened ? what happened ?
this right there from her everybody
UNknown 's favorite superhero right now is kick ass right ?
he sure does give plenty of action for the guests
good at UNknown his ass kicked
he should call himself ass kick instead
that doesn 't even make any sense
that guy 's gonna end up dead that 's what i think
i 'd probably notify him about it if a problem needed fixing
what you kidding me ?
i have 100 guys can fix a problem
you gotta some guy in some UNknown hose ?
well i wouldn 't wanna get in the way of your business where i 'm not wanted
please i know you are mistaking me for kick ass but i am not kick ass
i 'm backed up right now your message has been sent
you don 't actually read comics ?
it got right to my system
it 's got full UNknown and shows you leads that kind of thing
i 'm not really into UNknown UNknown or not
so guess you 'r e not gonna be lining up for that new kick ass comic then
you know what i was seriously thinking of e mailing his site ?
you know i volunteer at the needle exchange ?
no i didn t there was this one guy UNknown ?
and i just felt so sorry for him and more i found out about his up bringing and stuff i just
i 'm usually the one playing UNknown
can i make a confession ?
ever since i was little
i always wanted a friend like you
is it okay to say that ?
i mean it s not UNknown is it ?
i mean i don 't think you 'r e all the same or anything
i don 't know if i was everything katie had always dreamed her gay b f f would be
but i tried my best
but more importantly i talked her into e mailing kick ass
long story short this particular lame duck of hers turned out to be more of a lame cobra
she didn t want the money back that she 'd given him or an apology for the black eye he 'd given her
she just wanted him to get that they were through and leave her alone
let s be real no other request could UNknown e given me more pleasure
who the fuck you 'r e supposed to be ?
you know it ain 't halloween for another few months kid
i 'm here to see UNknown
who the fuck are you ?
i am a friend of katie 's
boys do not pay attention to their appearance these days
so uhh which one of you guys is UNknown ?
can 't you tell by my big UNknown 's ?
and now i am dead
i have a message for UNknown
you UNknown e gotta stay away from katie now
who the hell are you ?
and this is me giving you a message

nah if you 'r e right we 'r e gonna look like the biggest bunch of UNknown in new york
what do you want me to do ?
i want kick ass fuckin head on a stick
and i want it now
let 's keep it that way
you know what this is ?
all the cartridge crap that comes outta your gay little UNknown when you fire it
do you know the police could UNknown e traced it right back to you if they 'd found it ?
let 's call it insurance
makes it easier for me to take your word
but we don 't trust you
don 't take it personal though
we don 't trust anybody
i re UNknown your ip address
i hadn 't thought my god i
i 'm thinking of shutting my site down anyway quitting
i 'm in way over my head
but y UNknown now we re around if you need us
how do i get hold of you ?
just contact the mayor 's office
he has a special signal he shines in the sky ?
it 's in the shape of a giant cock
you need us put on your web site that you 'r e on vacation
we UNknown l find you
i need you to get rid of kick ass
but i 'm afraid i can 't help you out on this one
he 's movin outside my jurisdiction
you 'r e a fucking cop and he 's breaking the law !
that 's so inside your jurisdiction it 's ball deep in your jurisdiction 's ass !
the boss pays me to nail the bad guys
you pay me not to
everything else is in the grey area
yeah fuck you very much vic
just do it okay ?
un fuckin UNknown UNknown where is cody ?
let me out now ?
i gave you all them names and address
hey i won 't say nothing to nobody
you and you 'r e crazy bitch friend can go back to where ever you once
hey c 'm on now that 's a very bad thing you 'r e doing now
come on !! please hey stop !!!
you UNknown e done a self tan before right ?
UNknown breaking into my bedroom
my life was turning into some fucked up dream i couldn 't wake up from
even with the good parts were totally UNknown
oh hey i read those old UNknown spider UNknown you gave me ?
they 'r e actually pretty good
and it 's been a whole week since i UNknown e heard from UNknown
once upon a time there were two super cops called daddy and marcus who were very good at getting bad guys
frank UNknown was the UNknown guy of them all and he came up with a plan to get rid of daddy
being framed as drug dealer was the worst possible thing that could have happened to daddy
prison was not his natural UNknown
with daddy in prison his pregnant wife was all alone
but all clouds have a silver lining
and out of her death
marcus became the child 's guardian
and daddy started a plan of his very own
five years later he left prison
now it 's time for mindy to get ready too
how 'd you find me marcus ?
one of us is still a cop remember ?
now you brain washed mindy ?
you say brain washed i say made it into a game
what you call this ?
so where is she ?
she 's safe can i see her ?
but you need to go now
i should warn you that asshole UNknown is looking for kick ass
he got something to do with you damon ?
you started some kinda fucked up superhero club ?
ok well heads up alright ?
you keep carrying on like you UNknown e been carrying on and it s only a matter of time before UNknown 's looking for you
he 's been on d 'a UNknown s payroll ever since you passed up the opportunity
you know i 'm not gonna stop
it ain 't gonna bring her back damon
this is not the life for mindy
you owe that kid a childhood
i UNknown l tell you who owes her a childhood
he 's doing the high fives
i UNknown l give UNknown m a UNknown high five
he 's going into the alley
he 's going to the alley
kill my men huh ? !
take my fucking coke ? !
what are you doing ?
let us go come on
come on frank he had enough come on
come on let 's go come on
who would get to die that way ?
i just can 't believe he 's dead that 's all
listen katie guys like UNknown
they get mixed up in stuff and
i know but what if it was my fault ?
what if kick ass did it ?
i mean i feel like should call cops or something you 'r e talking crazy ! there 's no way !
he probably didn 't even read your e mail yet
yeah ? there 's nothing to worry about
i 'm so glad you 'r e here
i look like such a mess
i hope it 's okay to say this but
it so sucks that you 'r e gay
i don 't fuckin believe this
what kind of kid has a spider man party sure
but a fuckin kick ass party ?
what are they 'r e selling paper plates and napkins down at the store now ?
frank you 'r e UNknown me
you 'r e losin it
since when did you start getting your hands dirty again huh ?
since when i asked you UNknown to deliver me kick ass and you don 't deliver that 's when
hey give me a break it 's been a week
we got half the crew doing petty crimes as bait
we 'r e bustin our asses here
what hell are you doing ?
you back on the powder now as well ?
in child like voice mommy i want kick ass party
how long you been there ?
what the hell you doin ?
get the hell out !
you wanna hear it or not ?
okay look you 'r e a superhero and you 'r e lonely but you can 't trust anyone because either they UNknown l expose your secret identity
comic books this kids reads all fucking day long
point is there 's only one way a superhero would trust a stranger and
i could be that stranger
you just gotta give me a chance
i know i can do it
i just need a few things
what you fucking kidding me ?
what the hell is this ?
it 's everything i need
and you might have to screw somebody over like louie or somebody
i hate tony hey fuck tony he 's a scum bag
tony UNknown one of america 's most wanted crime king pins was arrested in queens today after a 911 cal from someone claiming to be a superhero
so how are things going with katie ?
had a sleep over and spent the whole night watching the entire ugly betty box set and did UNknown
i was gonna tell her
she just seems so happy
i don 't know UNknown the right time
well now 's your chance
oh did you watch the tv ?
the new superhero guy ?
can you UNknown it up please ?
red mist how do you see it ?
well i guess folks have just had enough of living in fear you know and uh
kick ass really proved that one individual can make a difference
so if anyone out there needs help i 'm gonna be fighting crime UNknown eight
can you turn that off now ?
what 's so special about that guy ?
he caught like a drug dealer some most wanted guy
he saw UNknown m bringing out like a ton of stuff that 's pretty cool
yeah way better costume than UNknown too
he 's gotta cape yeah
what better than kick ass ?
i mean they 'r e both kinda hot i just think that red mist has a better body
don 't you think dave ?
yeah dave what do you think ?

what the hell is that thing ?
let 's get the front he 's on his way
who the hell is this guy ?
i don 't know dad
but kick ass told me we 'r e not the only super heroes in town
maybe he knows who this guy is
i want this place locked down
nobody comes in nobody goes out
not until somebody finds this UNknown and blows his fuckin lungs out through his chest
they 'r e on to you did you hear me ?
they 'r e on to you
in a warehouse killing a whole bunch of d 'a UNknown 's guys
i 'm gonna take a wild guess that was you ?
look bro you need to get ghost
no more homework baby doll
it 's time for frank d 'a UNknown to go bye bye
right now i can 't beat the crap out of them
everything was out of control
i didn 't know what the hell to do
gonna have an early night tonight maybe ?
i never felt more alone
i UNknown e always dreamed of being a super hero
but this was a nightmare
it was time to stop wearing this stupid costume
but there was one last thing i needed it for
what 's the difference between spider man and peter parker ?
spider man gets the girl
faintly from noise of UNknown hey i 'm kick ass !
fuckin freak in a mask fuck !!
get out of my house
i 'm not gonna hurt you alright !
no no it 's me
i was only trying to surprise you dave ?? !!
sorry what the fuck are you doing ? !!
why are you dressed as kick ass ?
because i am kick ass
what are you talking about ?
and i know i UNknown e been an idiot and a shit friend i lied to you i know
i know and if it makes you feel any better i don 't think you could hate me any more right now
look i 'm really really sorry
i UNknown e never met anybody who was as beautiful and as kind and lovely as you
my mom has the burglar alarm set downstairs
like when we have a UNknown ?
i 'm sorry i didn 't mean to scare you
we gotta get over the top of it and then into it right in the middle of her
daddy i think i found one
and they can deliver it in three days
and it 's three hundred thousand dollars
can you think of anything else you 'd rather spend it on ?
out of UNknown and red mist who do you think would win in a fight ?
why are they fighting ?
what do you think ?
i for one would definitely fuck his brains out if i got the chance
do you uh feel like checking out that new kate hudson movie where she 's like a shoe designer kind of guy ?
i guess we 'r e not invited
alright you know what come here
i 'm going to request a great meal for you right now
suddenly i understood why super heroes only exist in the comics
i doubt why people didn 't risk their life for strangers because for the first time in my life
i had something to worth living for
katie was worried about me getting hurt so i promised her my kick ass days were over
i hardly missed it at all
i hadn 't even checked the web site for like a week
ok i 'm off then
wednesdays she does one of her volunteer things
you seem like a different guy you know that ?
your mom would UNknown e been so happy to see you out of your shell like this

i thought you were done with that ?
this is the last time
i wish you wouldn t worry
i care about you a lot
i care about you a lot too
this better be serious dude because i promised my girlfriend that i 'm done with all this shit
how about both of us being dead ?
well it turns out those dead guys from the warehouse had some bad motherfuckers for friends and they think we did that shit

kick ass i 'm sorry
we had a deal dad
we had a fucking deal that would get you the guy who did it
all i 'm asking is you let kick ass go !
he didn 't do anything wrong !
chris you gotta look at this from my point of view okay ?
i gotta send a public service message to the people out there that being a superhero is bad for your health
and the big motherfucker ?
nobody knows who he is
yeah but that 's not fair !
life 's not fair kid
what are you gonna do with them ?
then sit down shut up and watch
frank we 'r e ready
you patched up with this thing ?
i sure am big brother
hey where 's dave ?
hey have you guys noticed he 's with katie obviously
why else would i be here ?
with no idea as to who is behind the broadcast of this show
but we could see wide spread server crashes
dave why didn 't you tell this is what you were doing
hello boys and girls now this uh well you know who this guy is
and uh this guy here is big daddy
and these are my friends
yeah there they are hello hello
now big daddy and kick ass are gonna help us show you why being a hero is a bad idea
you know what a silent k is ?
that 's when k is at the beginning of the but you don 't pronounce it
like in the word knuckle duster
show them what knuckle duster can do guy
oh that must UNknown e hurt
let 's see that again on the other side go
oh yeah look at this
we have some of kick ass UNknown
we 'r e gonna show you what they can do
it 's also good for UNknown balls
oh this looks very painful
misguided UNknown suggest that this may be some kind of hoax or publicity stunt
it is now clear that the hostages are in genuine danger
that all signs point to the intentions to stage a live execution in the next few minutes
even with my metal plates and my fucked up nerve endings
i UNknown e gotta tell ya that hurt
and all the things i 'd never do
or see what me and katie 's kids would look like
or find out what happened on lost
you UNknown e never seen sin city ?
and this for all you brave men out there is fire
now switch to UNknown UNknown
UNknown 2 rounds and relay UNknown
i think i 'm in love with her dude
she looks like she 's about 11 years old but
i solemnly vow to save myself for her
i can see that this can be really difficult for you
i 'm so proud of you baby doll
getting shot daddy hurt a lot more than when you did it
that 's because i used low velocity rounds child
i love you too daddy
i love you dad good night
what 's your name ?
i mean your real name
a super hero never reveals her true identity
what look you can 't go on
is there anybody else ?
any other family or ?
i can take care of myself
i saved your sorry ass ! what about money ?
alright cause you UNknown e got to think long term
i UNknown e got three million dollars in a suitcase !
that long term enough for ya ?
it 's not all about the money
if not for you i 'd be dead
if it wasn 't for you my dad wouldn t be
look pack up whatever you need and we UNknown l go back to my place
i meant like pajamas and clothes and stuff
you can 't take that stuff to my house
you know what my dad would have really wanted ?
he would have wanted me to finish what we started
and that 's exactly what i 'm gonna do
is this frank d 'a UNknown 's place ?
my mom already died for nothing
so i 'm sure as hell not gonna let my dad die for nothing too
you wanna deal with owing my dad ?
then shut the hell up and pick your weapon
oh you better start reading the instructions cause you 'r e gonna be using it in about five minutes
yo listen up you UNknown e got 5 minutes and i want you back on your post and don 't leave a mess
can 't believe i got my gun back
that 's a little kid
what 's the matter with you ?
no i lost my mommy and daddy she lost her mommy and daddy
you wanna use my cell phone ?
now can you remember the number ?
had i ever been a real superhero ?
the most i 'd ever had to offer the world was good intentions and a slightly elevated capacity to take a kicking
with no power comes no responsibility
hey i 'm in here come help me out UNknown
and everybody 's dead !!!
she 's behind the counter she 's out of ammo
do you think they got her ?
if they didn 't he will
what the fuck is going on ?
we got her trapped she 's still alive
so what the hell you guys waiting for ?
go get her go ahead
i only got one fucking gun
i 'm not going in there
it 's only me boss
you 'r e grabbing a fucking bazooka you dumb ass
i always wanted to say this say hello to my little friend
play time 's over kid
ruin my business huh ?
i UNknown l kill every single fucking guy or gal in my way
i wish my son was just like you
why don 't you pick on someone your own size
mindy moved in with marcus and he enrolled her at my school
the screams of the two bully 's getting their ass kicked
kick ass was gone but not forgotten
and my world is much safer with all the new UNknown
they said i was their inspiration
but all i did was make a door into a world i dreamed about since i was little kid
a world full of super heroes huh ?
like a great man once said
wait UNknown l they get a load of me
protector against the forces of evil
he can catch a bullet faster than a speeding train
he leaps tall buildings in a single bound
is it a bird is it a plane ? mailman by day superhero by night
he protects new york from the forces of evil
the world has been protected by extraordinary men and women who have dedicated themselves to fighting crime
he has powers far beyond the UNknown of mere UNknown
i always wondered why nobody did it before me
you 'd think that one eccentric UNknown would have made himself a costume
is everyday life really so exciting are schools and offices so thrilling that i m the only one who ever UNknown about this ?
at some point in our lives we all wanted to be a super hero
that 's not me by the way
that 's some UNknown guy with a history of mental health problems
back before any of this crazy shit happened
guess i was the last person you 'd expect to become a superhero
not saying there was anything wrong with me
but there 's not nothing special either
i wasn 't into sports
i wasn 't a UNknown or a hard core UNknown
i didn 't have a piercing or an eating disorder or three thousand friends on UNknown
my only UNknown was being invisible to girls
but out of my friends man i wasn 't even the funny one
like most people my age i just existed
please open your books to act il scene ii
kick in my bedroom door you UNknown d probably find me watching tv
or talking to my friend todd on UNknown
me neither try UNknown com it 's good
mostly to my english teacher
david UNknown don 't think i haven 't noticed you looking at my tits ?
oh ! i want your hand all over me dave please
sure a lot of what got me through the average school day was making deposits in the UNknown off warehouse for later
though to be honest i didn 't take much to set me off
shouldn 't you be looking at hamlet right now ?
but don 't make me wrong
i like girls in my own age too
o k cool oh my god
hey look i 'm todd 's mom
oh that 's funny this is your dad
no that 's still my mom actually what the fuck ?
i was just a regular guy
no refugee status from a doomed alien world
todd said they do still make count UNknown
they just don t sell it in the store anymore
my mother was killed by an UNknown in the kitchen as opposed to a gunman in an alley
so if you were hoping for any
i will avenge you mother ! you 'r e outta luck
in fact in the eighteen months since my mother died the only UNknown i had was realizing that life just goes on
how come nobody 's ever tried to be a superhero ? well i dunno
probably cause it 's fucking impossible dip shit
what putting on a mask and helping people ?
how is that impossible ?
that 's not a superhero though
it has to have super
super is like being stronger than everybody and flying and shit
he didn 't have any powers
yeah but he had all expensive shit that doesn 't exist
i thought you meant like how come no one does it in real life
yeah todd that 's what i meant
dude if anybody did it in real life they 'd get their ass kicked
they 'd be dead in like a day a day
o k i 'm not saying they should do it
i just can t figure out why nobody does
doesn 't it bug you ?
why do thousands of people wanna be paris hilton and nobody wants to be spider man ?
yeah what 's with that ?
she has like no tits at all
maybe it 's the porn tape
he doesn 't have a porn tape
you never saw one night in spider man ?
is it just me or do you feel kinda sorry for chris d 'a UNknown ?
yeah must be terrible to have a rich dad and everything you want
i wish you hadn 't said anything
UNknown UNknown i feel like i 'm gonna start crying
no the fact that it
yeh but he 's always on his own
we should like talk to him
see if he wants to hang with us
i 'm not saying that we should talk to him but
c 'm on it d be awesome !
if he was our friend no one would ever fuck with us again !
no no what you mean ?
do not be afraid dave
wanna go over there ? yeah
yeah i would just UNknown his ass
when did you ever kick anyone 's ass ?
whatever man i would UNknown e just gone for his knees
you are not making sense
what i 'm saying is that in the joker portion when he got in UNknown when he vowed to penetrate the joker 's force field leaving him totally vulnerable
i don 't have one !
you wanna get cut ?
look at this asshole just watching
come on be honest with yourself would you do anything differently
we see someone in trouble and we wish we can help
the world i lived in heroes only exist in comic books
but i guess that would have been ok if bad guys were make believe too
i swear i 'm not making this up
comes outta nowhere kicks our asses steals all the coke
this would be the guy that looks like batman
i didn 't say look like batman
you said the the guy looked like batman
and you said like a mask and stuff and a cape ?
let me tell you the problem i got with that tre
our mole with the russians tells things a little different
according to him you UNknown e sold him my coke and you took the money
that 's a fucking lie !
i can 't believe that you would believe this shit from a fucking russian man
what 's more likely ?
that you 'r e a greedy little UNknown
my son is waitin out there in the car to go to the movies
and i UNknown gonna to disappoint him
joe you 'r e in charge
sorry you had to wait buddy
the movie is starting in 10 minutes
it 's o k we 'r e cool
we 'r e only gonna miss the UNknown
yeah but i wanted to get some popcorn
what do you wanna drink wanna UNknown ?
like when they mix the red one and the blue one ?
and a pack of UNknown
the comic books had it wrong
it didn 't take a trauma or cosmic rays or a power ring to make a superhero
just the perfect combination of optimism and UNknown
c 'm on mindy honey
be a big girl now
there 's nothin to be afraid of
is it gonna hurt bad ? oh child
only for a second sugar
UNknown bullet travels at more than ?
so at close range like this the force is gonna take you off your feet for sure
but it 's really no more painful than a punch in the chest
i hate getting punched in the chest
you 'r e gonna be fine baby doll
now you know how it feels you won 't be scared when some junkie asshole pulls a UNknown
wouldn 't have been scared anyways
that 's my girl ! UNknown ay
only if we can go by the bowling alley on the way back
two more rounds no UNknown no whining and you got yourself a deal young lady
i 'm gonna get hot fudge UNknown
good call baby doll !
so you gonna tell a little more about what you might want for your birthday ?
can i get a puppy ?
and a UNknown UNknown UNknown sasha
just fucking with you daddy !
you always knock me for a loop
i 'm gonna get you two
that 's what you get
i UNknown l be honest there wasn 't a whole lotta crime fighting in those first few weeks
but even so my new vocation kept me plenty busy
but if you called it UNknown it woulda been hard to argue
okay maybe i was still in the beta testing phase
but it was a start
get the fuck out of here
like every serial killer already knew eventually UNknown just doesn t do it for you anymore
it was time to engage
what the fuck are you looking at ?
i said what the fuck are you looking at ?
two UNknown losers screwing with a car that somebody probably worked their ass off to pay for
this motherfucker is obviously high
i just think it sucks you guys think you can do what you want
just walk away from the car and we can just forget about it
i came out just long enough to beg the medics not to tell anybody about the costume
he promised he wouldn 't
all i knew was that my dad was gonna kill me
why can not i get a gun ?
i am the security guard
you 'r e a doorman now
you don 't get a gun no more
i look like a UNknown
look at all them buttons
frank we got a thing
sorry for the very do what you gotta do
chris where you think you 'r e going ?
where do you think you 'r e going ?
i was just gonna sit in there quietly
i mean i should probably start learning and stuff anyway right ?
so what 's the problem ?
our russian says tre just sold them another 5 k 's at half price
so now i 'm getting fucked in the ass by a ghost

welcome to this special edition of eye on new york
how far would you go to help your fellow man ?
this UNknown covered individual has been all over the news this week
after this video of his intervention of street gang violence became the most watched web on the internet
on my space 38 press
kick ass is my favorite
this thing was going crazy
and i was loving it
finally we want to know who is this man
does anyone have any idea who this wet suit UNknown is ?
he must be someone 's son
what happened ? what happened ?
this right there from her everybody
UNknown 's favorite superhero right now is kick ass right ?
he sure does give plenty of action for the guests
good at UNknown his ass kicked
he should call himself ass kick instead
that doesn 't even make any sense
that guy 's gonna end up dead that 's what i think
i 'd probably notify him about it if a problem needed fixing
what you kidding me ?
i have 100 guys can fix a problem
you gotta some guy in some UNknown hose ?
well i wouldn 't wanna get in the way of your business where i 'm not wanted
please i know you are mistaking me for kick ass but i am not kick ass
i 'm backed up right now your message has been sent
you don 't actually read comics ?
it got right to my system
it 's got full UNknown and shows you leads that kind of thing
i 'm not really into UNknown UNknown or not
so guess you 'r e not gonna be lining up for that new kick ass comic then
you know what i was seriously thinking of e mailing his site ?
you know i volunteer at the needle exchange ?
no i didn t there was this one guy UNknown ?
and i just felt so sorry for him and more i found out about his up bringing and stuff i just
i 'm usually the one playing UNknown
can i make a confession ?
ever since i was little
i always wanted a friend like you
is it okay to say that ?
i mean it s not UNknown is it ?
i mean i don 't think you 'r e all the same or anything
i don 't know if i was everything katie had always dreamed her gay b f f would be
but i tried my best
but more importantly i talked her into e mailing kick ass
long story short this particular lame duck of hers turned out to be more of a lame cobra
she didn t want the money back that she 'd given him or an apology for the black eye he 'd given her
she just wanted him to get that they were through and leave her alone
let s be real no other request could UNknown e given me more pleasure
who the fuck you 'r e supposed to be ?
you know it ain 't halloween for another few months kid
i 'm here to see UNknown
who the fuck are you ?
i am a friend of katie 's
boys do not pay attention to their appearance these days
so uhh which one of you guys is UNknown ?
can 't you tell by my big UNknown 's ?
and now i am dead
i have a message for UNknown
you UNknown e gotta stay away from katie now
who the hell are you ?
and this is me giving you a message

nah if you 'r e right we 'r e gonna look like the biggest bunch of UNknown in new york
what do you want me to do ?
i want kick ass fuckin head on a stick
and i want it now
let 's keep it that way
you know what this is ?
all the cartridge crap that comes outta your gay little UNknown when you fire it
do you know the police could UNknown e traced it right back to you if they 'd found it ?
let 's call it insurance
makes it easier for me to take your word
but we don 't trust you
don 't take it personal though
we don 't trust anybody

i hadn 't thought my god i
i 'm thinking of shutting my site down anyway quitting
i 'm in way over my head
but y UNknown now we re around if you need us
how do i get hold of you ?
just contact the mayor 's office
he has a special signal he shines in the sky ?
it 's in the shape of a giant cock
you need us put on your web site that you 'r e on vacation
we UNknown l find you
i need you to get rid of kick ass
but i 'm afraid i can 't help you out on this one
he 's movin outside my jurisdiction
you 'r e a fucking cop and he 's breaking the law !
that 's so inside your jurisdiction it 's ball deep in your jurisdiction 's ass !
the boss pays me to nail the bad guys
you pay me not to
everything else is in the grey area
yeah fuck you very much vic
just do it okay ?
un fuckin UNknown UNknown where is cody ?
let me out now ?
i gave you all them names and address
hey i won 't say nothing to nobody
you and you 'r e crazy bitch friend can go back to where ever you once
hey c 'm on now that 's a very bad thing you 'r e doing now
come on !! please hey stop !!!
you UNknown e done a self tan before right ?
UNknown breaking into my bedroom
my life was turning into some fucked up dream i couldn 't wake up from
even with the good parts were totally UNknown
oh hey i read those old UNknown spider UNknown you gave me ?
they 'r e actually pretty good
and it 's been a whole week since i UNknown e heard from UNknown
once upon a time there were two super cops called daddy and marcus who were very good at getting bad guys
frank UNknown was the UNknown guy of them all and he came up with a plan to get rid of daddy
being framed as drug dealer was the worst possible thing that could have happened to daddy
prison was not his natural UNknown
with daddy in prison his pregnant wife was all alone
but all clouds have a silver lining
and out of her death
marcus became the child 's guardian
and daddy started a plan of his very own
five years later he left prison
now it 's time for mindy to get ready too
how 'd you find me marcus ?
one of us is still a cop remember ?
now you brain washed mindy ?
you say brain washed i say made it into a game
what you call this ?
so where is she ?
she 's safe can i see her ?
but you need to go now
i should warn you that asshole UNknown is looking for kick ass
he got something to do with you damon ?
you started some kinda fucked up superhero club ?
ok well heads up alright ?
you keep carrying on like you UNknown e been carrying on and it s only a matter of time before UNknown 's looking for you
he 's been on d 'a UNknown s payroll ever since you passed up the opportunity
you know i 'm not gonna stop
it ain 't gonna bring her back damon
this is not the life for mindy
you owe that kid a childhood
i UNknown l tell you who owes her a childhood
he 's doing the high fives
i UNknown l give UNknown m a UNknown high five
he 's going into the alley
he 's going to the alley
kill my men huh ? !
take my fucking coke ? !
what are you doing ?
let us go come on
come on frank he had enough come on
come on let 's go come on
who would get to die that way ?
i just can 't believe he 's dead that 's all
listen katie guys like UNknown
they get mixed up in stuff and
i know but what if it was my fault ?
what if kick ass did it ?
i mean i feel like should call cops or something you 'r e talking crazy ! there 's no way !
he probably didn 't even read your e mail yet
yeah ? there 's nothing to worry about
i 'm so glad you 'r e here
i look like such a mess
i hope it 's okay to say this but
it so sucks that you 'r e gay
i don 't fuckin believe this
what kind of kid has a spider man party sure
but a fuckin kick ass party ?
what are they 'r e selling paper plates and napkins down at the store now ?
frank you 'r e UNknown me
you 'r e losin it
since when did you start getting your hands dirty again huh ?
since when i asked you UNknown to deliver me kick ass and you don 't deliver that 's when
hey give me a break it 's been a week
we got half the crew doing petty crimes as bait
we 'r e bustin our asses here
what hell are you doing ?
you back on the powder now as well ?
in child like voice mommy i want kick ass party
how long you been there ?
what the hell you doin ?
get the hell out !
you wanna hear it or not ?
okay look you 'r e a superhero and you 'r e lonely but you can 't trust anyone because either they UNknown l expose your secret identity
comic books this kids reads all fucking day long
point is there 's only one way a superhero would trust a stranger and
i could be that stranger
you just gotta give me a chance
i know i can do it
i just need a few things
what you fucking kidding me ?
what the hell is this ?
it 's everything i need
and you might have to screw somebody over like louie or somebody
i hate tony hey fuck tony he 's a scum bag
tony UNknown one of america 's most wanted crime king pins was arrested in queens today after a 911 cal from someone claiming to be a superhero
so how are things going with katie ?
had a sleep over and spent the whole night watching the entire ugly betty box set and did UNknown
i was gonna tell her
she just seems so happy
i don 't know UNknown the right time
well now 's your chance
oh did you watch the tv ?
the new superhero guy ?
can you UNknown it up please ?
red mist how do you see it ?
well i guess folks have just had enough of living in fear you know and uh
kick ass really proved that one individual can make a difference
so if anyone out there needs help i 'm gonna be fighting crime UNknown eight
can you turn that off now ?
what 's so special about that guy ?
he caught like a drug dealer some most wanted guy
he saw UNknown m bringing out like a ton of stuff that 's pretty cool
yeah way better costume than UNknown too
he 's gotta cape yeah
what better than kick ass ?
i mean they 'r e both kinda hot i just think that red mist has a better body

what the hell is that thing ?
let 's get the front he 's on his way
who the hell is this guy ?
i don 't know dad
but kick ass told me we 'r e not the only super heroes in town
maybe he knows who this guy is
i want this place locked down
nobody comes in nobody goes out
not until somebody finds this UNknown and blows his fuckin lungs out through his chest
they 'r e on to you did you hear me ?
they 'r e on to you
in a warehouse killing a whole bunch of d 'a UNknown 's guys
i 'm gonna take a wild guess that was you ?
look bro you need to get ghost
no more homework baby doll
it 's time for frank d 'a UNknown to go bye bye
right now i can 't beat the crap out of them
everything was out of control
i didn 't know what the hell to do
gonna have an early night tonight maybe ?
i never felt more alone
i UNknown e always dreamed of being a super hero
but this was a nightmare
it was time to stop wearing this stupid costume
but there was one last thing i needed it for
what 's the difference between spider man and peter parker ?
spider man gets the girl
faintly from noise of UNknown hey i 'm kick ass !
fuckin freak in a mask fuck !!
get out of my house
i 'm not gonna hurt you alright !
no no it 's me
i was only trying to surprise you dave ?? !!
sorry what the fuck are you doing ? !!
why are you dressed as kick ass ?
because i am kick ass
what are you talking about ?
and i know i UNknown e been an idiot and a shit friend i lied to you i know
i know and if it makes you feel any better i don 't think you could hate me any more right now
look i 'm really really sorry
i UNknown e never met anybody who was as beautiful and as kind and lovely as you
my mom has the burglar alarm set downstairs
like when we have a UNknown ?
i 'm sorry i didn 't mean to scare you
we gotta get over the top of it and then into it right in the middle of her
daddy i think i found one
and they can deliver it in three days
and it 's three hundred thousand dollars
can you think of anything else you 'd rather spend it on ?
out of UNknown and red mist who do you think would win in a fight ?
why are they fighting ?
what do you think ?
i for one would definitely fuck his brains out if i got the chance
do you uh feel like checking out that new kate hudson movie where she 's like a shoe designer kind of guy ?
i guess we 'r e not invited
alright you know what come here
i 'm going to request a great meal for you right now
suddenly i understood why super heroes only exist in the comics
i doubt why people didn 't risk their life for strangers because for the first time in my life
i had something to worth living for
katie was worried about me getting hurt so i promised her my kick ass days were over
i hardly missed it at all
i hadn 't even checked the web site for like a week
ok i 'm off then
wednesdays she does one of her volunteer things
you seem like a different guy you know that ?
your mom would UNknown e been so happy to see you out of your shell like this

i wish you wouldn t worry
i care about you a lot
i care about you a lot too
this better be serious dude because i promised my girlfriend that i 'm done with all this shit
how about both of us being dead ?
well it turns out those dead guys from the warehouse had some bad motherfuckers for friends and they think we did that shit

kick ass i 'm sorry
we had a deal dad
we had a fucking deal that would get you the guy who did it
all i 'm asking is you let kick ass go !
he didn 't do anything wrong !
chris you gotta look at this from my point of view okay ?
i gotta send a public service message to the people out there that being a superhero is bad for your health
and the big motherfucker ?
nobody knows who he is
yeah but that 's not fair !
life 's not fair kid
what are you gonna do with them ?
then sit down shut up and watch
frank we 'r e ready
you patched up with this thing ?
i sure am big brother
hey where 's dave ?
hey have you guys noticed he 's with katie obviously
why else would i be here ?
with no idea as to who is behind the broadcast of this show
but we could see wide spread server crashes
dave why didn 't you tell this is what you were doing
hello boys and girls now this uh well you know who this guy is
and uh this guy here is big daddy
and these are my friends
yeah there they are hello hello
now big daddy and kick ass are gonna help us show you why being a hero is a bad idea
you know what a silent k is ?
that 's when k is at the beginning of the but you don 't pronounce it
like in the word knuckle duster
show them what knuckle duster can do guy
oh that must UNknown e hurt
let 's see that again on the other side go
oh yeah look at this
we have some of kick ass UNknown
we 'r e gonna show you what they can do
it 's also good for UNknown balls
oh this looks very painful
misguided UNknown suggest that this may be some kind of hoax or publicity stunt
it is now clear that the hostages are in genuine danger
that all signs point to the intentions to stage a live execution in the next few minutes
even with my metal plates and my fucked up nerve endings
i UNknown e gotta tell ya that hurt
and all the things i 'd never do
or see what me and katie 's kids would look like
or find out what happened on lost
you UNknown e never seen sin city ?
and this for all you brave men out there is fire
now switch to UNknown UNknown
UNknown 2 rounds and relay UNknown
i think i 'm in love with her dude
she looks like she 's about 11 years old but
i solemnly vow to save myself for her
i can see that this can be really difficult for you
i 'm so proud of you baby doll
getting shot daddy hurt a lot more than when you did it
that 's because i used low velocity rounds child
i love you too daddy
i love you dad good night
what 's your name ?
i mean your real name
a super hero never reveals her true identity
what look you can 't go on
is there anybody else ?
any other family or ?
i can take care of myself
i saved your sorry ass ! what about money ?
alright cause you UNknown e got to think long term
i UNknown e got three million dollars in a suitcase !
that long term enough for ya ?
it 's not all about the money
if not for you i 'd be dead
if it wasn 't for you my dad wouldn t be
look pack up whatever you need and we UNknown l go back to my place
i meant like pajamas and clothes and stuff
you can 't take that stuff to my house
you know what my dad would have really wanted ?
he would have wanted me to finish what we started
and that 's exactly what i 'm gonna do
is this frank d 'a UNknown 's place ?
my mom already died for nothing
so i 'm sure as hell not gonna let my dad die for nothing too
you wanna deal with owing my dad ?
then shut the hell up and pick your weapon
oh you better start reading the instructions cause you 'r e gonna be using it in about five minutes
yo listen up you UNknown e got 5 minutes and i want you back on your post and don 't leave a mess
can 't believe i got my gun back
that 's a little kid
what 's the matter with you ?
no i lost my mommy and daddy she lost her mommy and daddy
you wanna use my cell phone ?
now can you remember the number ?
had i ever been a real superhero ?
the most i 'd ever had to offer the world was good intentions and a slightly elevated capacity to take a kicking
with no power comes no responsibility
hey i 'm in here come help me out UNknown
and everybody 's dead !!!
she 's behind the counter she 's out of ammo
do you think they got her ?
if they didn 't he will
what the fuck is going on ?
we got her trapped she 's still alive
so what the hell you guys waiting for ?
go get her go ahead
i only got one fucking gun
i 'm not going in there
it 's only me boss
you 'r e grabbing a fucking bazooka you dumb ass
i always wanted to say this say hello to my little friend
play time 's over kid
ruin my business huh ?
i UNknown l kill every single fucking guy or gal in my way
i wish my son was just like you
why don 't you pick on someone your own size
mindy moved in with marcus and he enrolled her at my school
the screams of the two bully 's getting their ass kicked
kick ass was gone but not forgotten
and my world is much safer with all the new UNknown
they said i was their inspiration
but all i did was make a door into a world i dreamed about since i was little kid
a world full of super heroes huh ?
like a great man once said
wait UNknown l they get a load of me
protector against the forces of evil
he can catch a bullet faster than a speeding train
he leaps tall buildings in a single bound
is it a bird is it a plane ? mailman by day superhero by night
he protects new york from the forces of evil
the world has been protected by extraordinary men and women who have dedicated themselves to fighting crime
he has powers far beyond the UNknown of mere UNknown
i always wondered why nobody did it before me
you 'd think that one eccentric UNknown would have made himself a costume
is everyday life really so exciting are schools and offices so thrilling that i m the only one who ever UNknown about this ?
at some point in our lives we all wanted to be a super hero
that 's not me by the way
that 's some UNknown guy with a history of mental health problems
back before any of this crazy shit happened
guess i was the last person you 'd expect to become a superhero
not saying there was anything wrong with me
but there 's not nothing special either
i wasn 't into sports
i wasn 't a UNknown or a hard core UNknown
i didn 't have a piercing or an eating disorder or three thousand friends on UNknown
my only UNknown was being invisible to girls
but out of my friends man i wasn 't even the funny one
like most people my age i just existed
please open your books to act il scene ii
kick in my bedroom door you UNknown d probably find me watching tv
or talking to my friend todd on UNknown
me neither try UNknown com it 's good
mostly to my english teacher
david UNknown don 't think i haven 't noticed you looking at my tits ?
oh ! i want your hand all over me dave please
sure a lot of what got me through the average school day was making deposits in the UNknown off warehouse for later
though to be honest i didn 't take much to set me off
shouldn 't you be looking at hamlet right now ?
but don 't make me wrong
i like girls in my own age too
o k cool oh my god
hey look i 'm todd 's mom
oh that 's funny this is your dad
no that 's still my mom actually what the fuck ?
i was just a regular guy
no refugee status from a doomed alien world
todd said they do still make count UNknown
they just don t sell it in the store anymore
my mother was killed by an UNknown in the kitchen as opposed to a gunman in an alley
so if you were hoping for any
i will avenge you mother ! you 'r e outta luck
in fact in the eighteen months since my mother died the only UNknown i had was realizing that life just goes on
how come nobody 's ever tried to be a superhero ? well i dunno
probably cause it 's fucking impossible dip shit
what putting on a mask and helping people ?
how is that impossible ?
that 's not a superhero though
it has to have super
super is like being stronger than everybody and flying and shit
he didn 't have any powers
yeah but he had all expensive shit that doesn 't exist
i thought you meant like how come no one does it in real life
yeah todd that 's what i meant
dude if anybody did it in real life they 'd get their ass kicked
they 'd be dead in like a day a day
o k i 'm not saying they should do it
i just can t figure out why nobody does
doesn 't it bug you ?
why do thousands of people wanna be paris hilton and nobody wants to be spider man ?
yeah what 's with that ?
she has like no tits at all
maybe it 's the porn tape
he doesn 't have a porn tape
you never saw one night in spider man ?
is it just me or do you feel kinda sorry for chris d 'a UNknown ?
yeah must be terrible to have a rich dad and everything you want
i wish you hadn 't said anything
UNknown UNknown i feel like i 'm gonna start crying
no the fact that it
yeh but he 's always on his own
we should like talk to him
see if he wants to hang with us
i 'm not saying that we should talk to him but
c 'm on it d be awesome !
if he was our friend no one would ever fuck with us again !
no no what you mean ?
do not be afraid dave
wanna go over there ? yeah
yeah i would just UNknown his ass
when did you ever kick anyone 's ass ?
whatever man i would UNknown e just gone for his knees
you are not making sense
what i 'm saying is that in the joker portion when he got in UNknown when he vowed to penetrate the joker 's force field leaving him totally vulnerable
i don 't have one !
you wanna get cut ?
look at this asshole just watching
come on be honest with yourself would you do anything differently
we see someone in trouble and we wish we can help
the world i lived in heroes only exist in comic books
but i guess that would have been ok if bad guys were make believe too
i swear i 'm not making this up
comes outta nowhere kicks our asses steals all the coke
this would be the guy that looks like batman
i didn 't say look like batman
you said the the guy looked like batman
and you said like a mask and stuff and a cape ?
let me tell you the problem i got with that tre
our mole with the russians tells things a little different
according to him you UNknown e sold him my coke and you took the money
that 's a fucking lie !
i can 't believe that you would believe this shit from a fucking russian man
what 's more likely ?
that you 'r e a greedy little UNknown
my son is waitin out there in the car to go to the movies
and i UNknown gonna to disappoint him
joe you 'r e in charge
sorry you had to wait buddy
the movie is starting in 10 minutes
it 's o k we 'r e cool
we 'r e only gonna miss the UNknown
yeah but i wanted to get some popcorn
what do you wanna drink wanna UNknown ?
like when they mix the red one and the blue one ?
and a pack of UNknown
the comic books had it wrong
it didn 't take a trauma or cosmic rays or a power ring to make a superhero
just the perfect combination of optimism and UNknown
c 'm on mindy honey
be a big girl now
there 's nothin to be afraid of
is it gonna hurt bad ? oh child
only for a second sugar
UNknown bullet travels at more than ?
so at close range like this the force is gonna take you off your feet for sure
but it 's really no more painful than a punch in the chest
i hate getting punched in the chest
you 'r e gonna be fine baby doll
now you know how it feels you won 't be scared when some junkie asshole pulls a UNknown
wouldn 't have been scared anyways
that 's my girl ! UNknown ay
only if we can go by the bowling alley on the way back
two more rounds no UNknown no whining and you got yourself a deal young lady
i 'm gonna get hot fudge UNknown
good call baby doll !
so you gonna tell a little more about what you might want for your birthday ?
can i get a puppy ?
and a UNknown UNknown UNknown sasha
just fucking with you daddy !
you always knock me for a loop
i 'm gonna get you two
that 's what you get
i UNknown l be honest there wasn 't a whole lotta crime fighting in those first few weeks
but even so my new vocation kept me plenty busy
but if you called it UNknown it woulda been hard to argue
okay maybe i was still in the beta testing phase
but it was a start
get the fuck out of here
like every serial killer already knew eventually UNknown just doesn t do it for you anymore
it was time to engage
what the fuck are you looking at ?
i said what the fuck are you looking at ?
two UNknown losers screwing with a car that somebody probably worked their ass off to pay for
this motherfucker is obviously high
i just think it sucks you guys think you can do what you want
just walk away from the car and we can just forget about it
i came out just long enough to beg the medics not to tell anybody about the costume
he promised he wouldn 't
all i knew was that my dad was gonna kill me
why can not i get a gun ?
i am the security guard
you 'r e a doorman now
you don 't get a gun no more
i look like a UNknown
look at all them buttons
frank we got a thing
sorry for the very do what you gotta do
chris where you think you 'r e going ?
where do you think you 'r e going ?
i was just gonna sit in there quietly
i mean i should probably start learning and stuff anyway right ?
so what 's the problem ?
our russian says tre just sold them another 5 k 's at half price
so now i 'm getting fucked in the ass by a ghost
or tre was telling the truth
what so this is my choice ?
i have to believe in ghosts or UNknown ?
not the part about the superhero franky
just that he UNknown really been UNknown by somebody
i think we better invited our russian friend over for a friendly chat
see what 's really going on
you beat me to it
i wanted to get you breakfast this morning
happy birthday sweetheart check this out
thank you thank you thank you !
what is the proper name for one of those ?
isabelle it 's uh UNknown
the ar 15 was a lighter smaller caliber version of what design ?
eugene 7 ar 10 give me a hard one
name john woo 's first full length feature
hey come on you 'r e not looking the point is some fucker 's killing our guys
if you find out who that is i don 't wanna see any of you bitches sitting on your asses all right !!
dad the phone 's for you
who is it ? it 's joe
but we do got a brand new industrial UNknown they use her for treating the lumber
so where is it ?
i think you must be confusing me with someone who gives a shit about the fucking lumber

hey you re into comic books aren t you ?
i could buy you one sometime if you want ?
well i UNknown l see you later
katie UNknown just offered to buy me coffee
yeah i really don 't think that 's the way it looks like
what are you talking about ?
the point is katie UNknown is all about the lame ducks
what 's that got to do with me ?
i UNknown e been trying to figure out how to tell you this
what kind of rumor is that ?
well you know getting UNknown
you guys have been UNknown !
yeah i know but you know we didn 't get beat up and have all our clothes taken off
that 's not even true !
the medics threw my clothes away !
don 't worry about it
rumors don 't mean shit
and who knows it might even get you laid
not if she thinks he 's gay todd you fuckin retard !
you UNknown fucking helping me
i 'm just being honest
i was getting back to my old self
i should have quit of course
but you can 't just re program yourself what you want who you are your purpose in life oh no i 'm just stand around here
it is what it is
you didn 't see that did ya ?
i think it 's best that you just walk away
you looking at me ?
my hardware was fixed now

welcome to this special edition of eye on new york
how far would you go to help your fellow man ?
this UNknown covered individual has been all over the news this week
after this video of his intervention of street gang violence became the most watched web on the internet
on my space 38 press
kick ass is my favorite
this thing was going crazy
and i was loving it
finally we want to know who is this man
does anyone have any idea who this wet suit UNknown is ?
he must be someone 's son
what happened ? what happened ?
this right there from her everybody
UNknown 's favorite superhero right now is kick ass right ?
he sure does give plenty of action for the guests
good at UNknown his ass kicked
he should call himself ass kick instead
that doesn 't even make any sense
that guy 's gonna end up dead that 's what i think
i 'd probably notify him about it if a problem needed fixing
what you kidding me ?
i have 100 guys can fix a problem
you gotta some guy in some UNknown hose ?
well i wouldn 't wanna get in the way of your business where i 'm not wanted
please i know you are mistaking me for kick ass but i am not kick ass
i 'm backed up right now your message has been sent
you don 't actually read comics ?
it got right to my system
it 's got full UNknown and shows you leads that kind of thing
i 'm not really into UNknown UNknown or not
so guess you 'r e not gonna be lining up for that new kick ass comic then
you know what i was seriously thinking of e mailing his site ?
you know i volunteer at the needle exchange ?
no i didn t there was this one guy UNknown ?
and i just felt so sorry for him and more i found out about his up bringing and stuff i just
i 'm usually the one playing UNknown
can i make a confession ?
ever since i was little
i always wanted a friend like you
is it okay to say that ?
i mean it s not UNknown is it ?
i mean i don 't think you 'r e all the same or anything
i don 't know if i was everything katie had always dreamed her gay b f f would be
but i tried my best
but more importantly i talked her into e mailing kick ass
long story short this particular lame duck of hers turned out to be more of a lame cobra
she didn t want the money back that she 'd given him or an apology for the black eye he 'd given her
she just wanted him to get that they were through and leave her alone
let s be real no other request could UNknown e given me more pleasure
who the fuck you 'r e supposed to be ?
you know it ain 't halloween for another few months kid
i 'm here to see UNknown
who the fuck are you ?
i am a friend of katie 's
boys do not pay attention to their appearance these days
so uhh which one of you guys is UNknown ?

what do you want me to do ?
i want kick ass fuckin head on a stick
and i want it now
let 's keep it that way
you know what this is ?
all the cartridge crap that comes outta your gay little UNknown when you fire it
do you know the police could UNknown e traced it right back to you if they 'd found it ?
let 's call it insurance

it 's in the shape of a giant cock
you need us put on your web site that you 'r e on vacation

i need you to get rid of kick ass
but i 'm afraid i can 't help you out on this one

you 'r e a fucking cop and he 's breaking the law !
that 's so inside your jurisdiction it 's ball deep in your jurisdiction 's ass !
the boss pays me to nail the bad guys
you pay me not to
everything else is in the grey area
yeah fuck you very much vic

i gave you all them names and address
hey i won 't say nothing to nobody
you and you 'r e crazy bitch friend can go back to where ever you once
hey c 'm on now that 's a very bad thing you 'r e doing now
come on !! please hey stop !!!
you UNknown e done a self tan before right ?
UNknown breaking into my bedroom
my life was turning into some fucked up dream i couldn 't wake up from
even with the good parts were totally UNknown
oh hey i read those old UNknown spider UNknown you gave me ?
they 'r e actually pretty good
and it 's been a whole week since i UNknown e heard from UNknown
once upon a time there were two super cops called daddy and marcus who were very good at getting bad guys
frank UNknown was the UNknown guy of them all and he came up with a plan to get rid of daddy
being framed as drug dealer was the worst possible thing that could have happened to daddy
prison was not his natural UNknown
with daddy in prison his pregnant wife was all alone
but all clouds have a silver lining
and out of her death
marcus became the child 's guardian
and daddy started a plan of his very own
five years later he left prison
now it 's time for mindy to get ready too
how 'd you find me marcus ?
one of us is still a cop remember ?
now you brain washed mindy ?
you say brain washed i say made it into a game
what you call this ?
so where is she ?
she 's safe can i see her ?
but you need to go now
i should warn you that asshole UNknown is looking for kick ass
he got something to do with you damon ?
you started some kinda fucked up superhero club ?
ok well heads up alright ?
you keep carrying on like you UNknown e been carrying on and it s only a matter of time before UNknown 's looking for you
he 's been on d 'a UNknown s payroll ever since you passed up the opportunity
you know i 'm not gonna stop
it ain 't gonna bring her back damon
this is not the life for mindy
you owe that kid a childhood
i UNknown l tell you who owes her a childhood
he 's doing the high fives
i UNknown l give UNknown m a UNknown high five
he 's going into the alley
he 's going to the alley
kill my men huh ? !
take my fucking coke ? !
what are you doing ?
let us go come on
come on frank he had enough come on
come on let 's go come on
who would get to die that way ?
i just can 't believe he 's dead that 's all
listen katie guys like UNknown
they get mixed up in stuff and
i know but what if it was my fault ?
what if kick ass did it ?
i mean i feel like should call cops or something you 'r e talking crazy ! there 's no way !
he probably didn 't even read your e mail yet
yeah ? there 's nothing to worry about
i 'm so glad you 'r e here
i look like such a mess
i hope it 's okay to say this but
it so sucks that you 'r e gay
i don 't fuckin believe this
what kind of kid has a spider man party sure
but a fuckin kick ass party ?
what are they 'r e selling paper plates and napkins down at the store now ?
frank you 'r e UNknown me
you 'r e losin it
since when did you start getting your hands dirty again huh ?
since when i asked you UNknown to deliver me kick ass and you don 't deliver that 's when
hey give me a break it 's been a week

we 'r e bustin our asses here
what hell are you doing ?

in child like voice mommy i want kick ass party
how long you been there ?
what the hell you doin ?
get the hell out !
you wanna hear it or not ?
okay look you 'r e a superhero and you 'r e lonely but you can 't trust anyone because either they UNknown l expose your secret identity
comic books this kids reads all fucking day long
point is there 's only one way a superhero would trust a stranger and
i could be that stranger
you just gotta give me a chance
i know i can do it
i just need a few things
what you fucking kidding me ?
what the hell is this ?
it 's everything i need
and you might have to screw somebody over like louie or somebody
i hate tony hey fuck tony he 's a scum bag
tony UNknown one of america 's most wanted crime king pins was arrested in queens today after a 911 cal from someone claiming to be a superhero
so how are things going with katie ?
had a sleep over and spent the whole night watching the entire ugly betty box set and did UNknown
i was gonna tell her
she just seems so happy
i don 't know UNknown the right time
well now 's your chance
oh did you watch the tv ?
the new superhero guy ?
can you UNknown it up please ?
red mist how do you see it ?
well i guess folks have just had enough of living in fear you know and uh
kick ass really proved that one individual can make a difference
so if anyone out there needs help i 'm gonna be fighting crime UNknown eight
can you turn that off now ?
what 's so special about that guy ?
he caught like a drug dealer some most wanted guy
he saw UNknown m bringing out like a ton of stuff that 's pretty cool
yeah way better costume than UNknown too

right now i can 't beat the crap out of them
everything was out of control
i didn 't know what the hell to do

i never felt more alone
i UNknown e always dreamed of being a super hero
but this was a nightmare
it was time to stop wearing this stupid costume

i 'm sorry i didn 't mean to scare you
we gotta get over the top of it and then into it right in the middle of her
daddy i think i found one
and they can deliver it in three days
and it 's three hundred thousand dollars
can you think of anything else you 'd rather spend it on ?
out of UNknown and red mist who do you think would win in a fight ?
why are they fighting ?
what do you think ?
i for one would definitely fuck his brains out if i got the chance
do you uh feel like checking out that new kate hudson movie where she 's like a shoe designer kind of guy ?
i guess we 'r e not invited
alright you know what come here
i 'm going to request a great meal for you right now
suddenly i understood why super heroes only exist in the comics
i doubt why people didn 't risk their life for strangers because for the first time in my life
i had something to worth living for
katie was worried about me getting hurt so i promised her my kick ass days were over
i hardly missed it at all
i hadn 't even checked the web site for like a week

hello boys and girls now this uh well you know who this guy is
and uh this guy here is big daddy
and these are my friends
yeah there they are hello hello

you know what a silent k is ?
that 's when k is at the beginning of the but you don 't pronounce it

oh that must UNknown e hurt
let 's see that again on the other side go
oh yeah look at this
we have some of kick ass UNknown
we 'r e gonna show you what they can do
it 's also good for UNknown balls
oh this looks very painful
misguided UNknown suggest that this may be some kind of hoax or publicity stunt
it is now clear that the hostages are in genuine danger
that all signs point to the intentions to stage a live execution in the next few minutes
even with my metal plates and my fucked up nerve endings
i UNknown e gotta tell ya that hurt
and all the things i 'd never do
or see what me and katie 's kids would look like
or find out what happened on lost
you UNknown e never seen sin city ?
and this for all you brave men out there is fire

she looks like she 's about 11 years old but
i solemnly vow to save myself for her
i can see that this can be really difficult for you
i 'm so proud of you baby doll
getting shot daddy hurt a lot more than when you did it
that 's because i used low velocity rounds child
i love you too daddy

look pack up whatever you need and we UNknown l go back to my place
i meant like pajamas and clothes and stuff
you can 't take that stuff to my house
you know what my dad would have really wanted ?
he would have wanted me to finish what we started
and that 's exactly what i 'm gonna do
is this frank d 'a UNknown 's place ?
my mom already died for nothing
so i 'm sure as hell not gonna let my dad die for nothing too
you wanna deal with owing my dad ?
then shut the hell up and pick your weapon
oh you better start reading the instructions cause you 'r e gonna be using it in about five minutes
yo listen up you UNknown e got 5 minutes and i want you back on your post and don 't leave a mess
can 't believe i got my gun back
that 's a little kid
what 's the matter with you ?
no i lost my mommy and daddy she lost her mommy and daddy
you wanna use my cell phone ?
now can you remember the number ?
had i ever been a real superhero ?
the most i 'd ever had to offer the world was good intentions and a slightly elevated capacity to take a kicking
with no power comes no responsibility
hey i 'm in here come help me out UNknown
and everybody 's dead !!!
she 's behind the counter she 's out of ammo
do you think they got her ?
if they didn 't he will

i wish my son was just like you
why don 't you pick on someone your own size
mindy moved in with marcus and he enrolled her at my school
the screams of the two bully 's getting their ass kicked
kick ass was gone but not forgotten
and my world is much safer with all the new UNknown
they said i was their inspiration
but all i did was make a door into a world i dreamed about since i was little kid
a world full of super heroes huh ?
like a great man once said
wait UNknown l they get a load of me
subtitles UNknown by dr UNknown r khan

it 's a gasoline engine
i know you 'r e here
the germans have found your pass at the burnt out farm
helmsman UNknown the krauts know you were in the neighbourhood
they wrote down the number of your sail
one plus one is two even for the krauts
a hidden jewish woman disappears and the only sailor around to help is you
what are you doing here ?
soon the UNknown will come and arrest her for transport to poland
and you and your family will be put in jail for aiding jews
how did this news reach you ?
the police report of the krauts landed in the hands of the the UNknown police
be happy that there 's so many good cops in holland
wasn 't i clear enough ?
you have to help me and rob to go into hiding
with UNknown s you mean the resistance
you 'r e with them
so you can help us right ?
maybe yes but it 's dangerous
we UNknown l take that risk
there 's an escape route through the UNknown
i can get you to liberated territory
in a few weeks the tommy 's will be here and holland will be liberated

my hideout is blown up

you UNknown l have to sign the receipt
i have to justify this to your father later on
do you know where my parents are ?
no i don 't know and i don 't want to know
you don 't want to check first ?
rachel you can 't trust someone blindly
that 's my little brother
he said you were going to cross
then we wanted to go too

he 's just had an operation
i 'm sorry i didn 't know
could you throw away the plank ?
you 'r e not joining us ?
it UNknown too much in the dark
i keep it on even in my sleep
then move up your collar
saved it for a party
what happened to you ?
he almost couldn 't join us
my notary found us doctor just in time
he gave us the address of the hideout
odd he kept repeating he didn 't know
no he was being careful
where was your hideout ?
in the attic of a boring grocer 's man
a socialist but still good
why are we going east ?
how can you tell ?
i used to be helmsman on a big ship
before the war i was on the holland america line
we never get any complaints
can 't do any wider otherwise they UNknown l notice
no i mean in the rain
you can clean yourself up over there
i don 't know how i will ever be able to thank you
instead thank the people who found you for warning us instead of warning the UNknown
you UNknown l get used to the name
do you have a good id ?
did you ever do any cooking ?
yes i used to at home kosher
but you UNknown l have to work
her whole family was murdered by the ss
some time we UNknown l get back to them ellis
could you be a replacement
even if it 's dangerous ?
ok everybody knows the procedure
the group UNknown handles the technical side we as UNknown will give cover
you stay at 200 metres UNknown
and i give the signs
then pass on the gin
and what 's my job in this boys club ?
you can play my fiancee
you UNknown l be playing a couple
so the krauts won 't be paying attention
haven 't had this for 2 years
ellis you UNknown l be carrying this tomorrow
are we going to swing ?
i am going to plant a microphone in the head office of the UNknown
but that 's heavily guarded right ?
am a maintenance technician at the phone company
the krauts need us all the time
i can walk in and out no problem
i was just waiting for this
i can 't take this across the street
handle with care it says
there 's still some suitcases left in the office
oh my god we took 5 lives
what have we done ?
it was them or us theo
let 's load up we have to leave
he 's such a cold one hans
he 's a top marksman
and if he had missed
hans was the best marksman of pro UNknown
hans UNknown and me were members
and we work together for helping the jews
hans is great he UNknown l get you through anything
no kraut to be seen
they were working on their own
we UNknown l have to them a christian burial
there are lots of deep holes here theo
you can throw UNknown m in there by yourself
keep your id 's ready
we 'r e in love right ?
you pull the emergency brake
leave the train and run
can 't think of anything else
beautiful ladies should not carry heavy bags
you like music very much ?
i used to be a singer before the war
i loved those as a child
all those far away countries
i collect them since i was six
i always collect the countries where i am stationed
first poland then france and now here
you UNknown e stopped with our queen
the UNknown stamps from the dutch india
i don 't know if i UNknown l ever get them complete
i 'd be glad to take you home
so you don 't have to carry them
i am being picked up
maybe i UNknown l see you around
m UNknown he 's called
because of him lots of people of the resistance have died
and a man like that collects stamps ?
mr UNknown it 's our car
you 'r e too late
they UNknown l get you
if they get you we 'r e all fucked
they UNknown l beat it out of you
mr UNknown there 's nothing more we can do
here take everything to UNknown
ellis you take the suitcases of the dropping
tell them there 's a UNknown here
thanks to that arse called m UNknown they now have tim
please tell UNknown m the soup kitchen is now closed
you met this m UNknown in the train right ?
and he kinda liked you
he showed me his stamps
how far would you be willing to go with him
you mean sleep with him ?
that 's a rude way of saying it
i like things to be clear
is that what you mean ?
a deadly sin good suit for a dead body while everyone else walks in rags
where did she put the suitcase ?
over there in the office
this is none of you business
after the train incident maybe a little ?
there 's a dying need for that
imagine a UNknown without his UNknown he can say bye bye
you have it as well ?
at the revue there was UNknown comedian
he always injected before a performance
en he had to eat a lot of chocolate if he injected too much
at least half of it is broken
the hospital will be happy with that
don 't ask so i can 't give away any secrets
it stings it stings it stings
shall the doctor have a look at it ?
UNknown the girl is here again
you 'r e back ?
we never got any further than the UNknown
and your parents and max
they joined you didn 't they ?
everybody 's dead and i can 't cry for them
but someone brought you to the UNknown right ?
a man from the underground
i am supposed to work for queen and country by getting friendly with a high ranking UNknown officer
maybe even sleep with him
you 'r e on your own with that
but maybe there 's something in here that can help me
i am here to see captain m UNknown
it 's about the royal house
send her to captain m UNknown
to what do i owe the pleasure ?
i have family in the dutch india
my mother kept the letters
put it over there ronnie
i don 't want to damage these lovely stamps
shall i serve you ?
no don 't bother i UNknown l do that
what were you planning to do with these stamps
nothing special they were in a drawer in my place
almost all the UNknown stamps i don 't have
take my hat and coat please
i haven 't been able to choose yet
i think i ate too much chocolate
i don 't get it everyday
i have to go to a party
there will be much more to eat there
what if you could go home and pick up your phonograph and records and join me ?
without the UNknown from the UNknown
all our successes had not been possible
your fight against the terrorists is our fight
the champagne didn 't go down well
i am not used to any alcohol anymore
but i 'm alright now
shall i sing some ?
it is my great honour to present you ellis de UNknown
she will sing some for us
i 'd like to see your stamps
there 's quite many of them
i have lots of time
from the UNknown we kicked out
there is no need for that anymore now
your hair is normally black
or this fashion will help you survive for instance if you are a jew
do you also have to pee after sex ?
you were really great tonight
did he hire you m UNknown ?
you came looking for a job right ?
no but i am searching for one
but i am no party member
neither am i although i do agree with them
holland is after all a piece of germany
we all speak a sort of german dialect
and good food and great drinks
are you playing with each other ?
we were talking about work
ellis would like to work for us
someone who sings such good german is hired right away
that is if you pass the inspection
if that isn 't healthy i don 't know what is
no no these are reserved for captain m UNknown
you can start helping with the f UNknown 's birthday tomorrow
you 'r e married i see
g UNknown had sworn that no english bomb would fall on germany
christina was with the children in the wrong hideout
to not have anything ellis
for you it must be a beautiful sound
you haven 't told us anything
i don 't know anything
someone else put those weapons in the car
you are just a little piece of shit on our road to final victory
within the hour you UNknown l talk
are we here alone ?
the rest fled back to germany
could you come and sit here ?
so we can sit next to each other
type it out and copy it 15 times
you have spots on your uniform
it 's nothing just water
hurry up there will be more to do
if you read i UNknown l type
let 's take these of with them i can 't type
of course what did you think ?
got it from g UNknown
i am a member of a resistance group
what are you doing here ?
i want to talk with the germans about justice
people of the resistance have no rights but as a lawyer i try to help them nonetheless
with a guy like UNknown ?
how did you know i was here ?
i do not underestimate you
that m UNknown guy is quite nice don 't you think ?
could you give me a hand ?
we have to decorate the hallway for the f UNknown 's birthday
don 't forget to put the f UNknown in the right perspective
the execution order for the 3 terrorists
tomorrow we shoot UNknown m
no one is getting shot
but they confessed they have to be shot
f UNknown 's order you know that
only i am in command here
what are you doing here ?
the nicest one is for you
are you coming with me ?
actually i have to go home
so i won 't be seeing you tonight ?
jesus what a horny animal
just a dirty kraut whore
we UNknown l get those after the war
shave them put their heads in tar and kill them
come on don 't be so primitive
shit the generator is cutting out
those rich jews always come from the same circles
if i wanted to i could find out who your UNknown is
this could cost you your head
or save mine after the war
after the war i won 't be here
so it wasn 't a coincidence that german boat
they 'r e just working on a list
they promise to take them to belgium but instead they kill them
how do you know ?
UNknown UNknown i have been set up to
who is this van UNknown ?
he poses as someone of the resistance
he tells jews that they can run for it just make sure to bring your money
UNknown waits for them kills them and finally robs them
so now there 's a new list of potential victims
we cannot let that happen
we don 't know who or where they are
what if we just kill UNknown ?
no if we kill him 20 30 hostages will line up against a wall
we don 't shoot UNknown and 20 30 jews will be killed
is the life of a random jew worth more than a good dutchman ?
who decides that you ?
on behalf of UNknown i am negotiating a truce
if those are the UNknown UNknown dutchman
things are the way they are
we can 't let those jews be slaughtered
we can 't just kill van UNknown
what if he just disappears ?
he will have people shot
or he thinks van UNknown has deserted
after he just promised him a new list ?
van UNknown is trying to cover up for after the war says so himself
if he disappears UNknown will think he just ran
there 's one thing UNknown and UNknown pass by too easy
someone has been setting up jews for a long time
van UNknown has a suspect
he UNknown l have to tell us
i UNknown l round up my boys
i 'm meeting m UNknown
you alone know van UNknown 's face
we can 't do anything without you
the bullet must come out though
oh god that shit doesn 't work you dick !
jesus that stuff is way over due
that 's why van UNknown wasn 't knocked out
guys cheers on a happy ending
they killed my best soldier
that brave warrior and UNknown handed me millions
and now he 's dead shot by god damn terrorists
he 's a murderer you are not
i am just as bad as the nazi 's
i said no didn 't i ?
i said god damn no didn 't i ?
the bastard had to die
besides what does it matter ?
along with 40 other hostages
how do you know ?
from the microphone we placed on UNknown
you still negotiate with m UNknown ?
not after the attack you pulled
tim is as good as dead
i am turning myself in
only i shall face the firing squad
i will be beside you hans
i carry most of the guilt
stop it this is ridiculous
you 'r e all drunk
before you know it all of the resistance will give up because of gin
turning in is not a solution
you will not get out alive of the UNknown basement
the building plans of the UNknown office when it was still a bank
got it from a friend
i thought you were not coming back
i lost track of time at home
and then it was curfew and i had to sneak my way in
what do we have here ?
how dumb do you think i am ?
suddenly a beautiful woman comes into my life
later she comes to my headquarters
then she accidentally has the stamps i am looking for
then she UNknown appears to be jewish
and as soon as she comes to work here
UNknown 's best undercover man gets killed
quite a coincidence don 't you think ?
be silent and i will hand you to UNknown tomorrow
or you tell me everything now
only if you put away that gun
i kissed you now tell me
put away your jackets and get to work
call all prisons and ask how many hostages they have
you can stop at 40 pieces delivery today
executions will be tomorrow morning at 06 00
those calls will not be necessary
what document are you looking for ?
none you are under the suspicion of robbing and killing rich jews
there 's nothing against that but you are accused of keeping their treasure to yourself
by not handing over jewish property to the empire you risk court martial and the death penalty
from UNknown 9 when we started our campaign
saved it for our victory
your UNknown seems to have been mistaken
this person is always well informed
m UNknown is negotiating with terrorists
he promised them no more UNknown
even not for the murder of van UNknown
the resistance is willing to stop and give in their weapons
this is in violation of a f UNknown order of the 4th of september
which stays in force !
why shed more blood ?
that champagne will never be drunk
and negotiating with enemy is high treason
this means death penalty m UNknown
hans the papers to get inside
a bullet now or a medal after the war
UNknown what are you up to ?
i will not let you go alone
i can 't stay here and do nothing
i 'm going to liberate 40 man
it 's your job to get them safely out of here
you will get tim back
on my word of honour
why aren 't you at your station ?
good so the krauts are killing among themselves
get m UNknown out or i 'm out
that leaves us no choice
you really think this highly of this dick ?
m UNknown being arrested doesn 't do you anything ?
where there is life there is hope
what hope do we have left ?
that the tommy 's will arrive
ellis we 'r e finished
we worked for the krauts
the families of the poor bastards that UNknown tortured will come here
or the resistance will kill us
the resistance won 't kill anyone
i had never thought you would
that 's like mata hari with greta garbo
you go ahead i UNknown l join
hostages and terrorists from UNknown
UNknown UNknown boys hurry up
what 's going on down there ?
ronnie you help k UNknown
ellis you did a great job
they have been beautifully set up with that coal hatch
what a dirty jewish trick
we won 't be needing this english toy now anymore
my dear UNknown lieutenant UNknown is saying goodbye to you now
good night and good watch
thank you for your cooperation
never bite more than you can chew darling
tomorrow firing squad along side with your m UNknown
even if it 's the last thing i can do
how can she do that as a jew ?
what if you had to chose between a bullet or treason
an explanation is not an excuse
oh no my beautiful dress
i 'd never have thought
here you lazy dry UNknown m
i wish it could stay like that forever
but not here in holland
they UNknown l think i am a traitor
they will look for me
we UNknown l have to straighten that out
do you really think they UNknown l let you finish your talk as an UNknown officer
the war is over my love
for us it is merely starting
have a look down below
did your really think we 'd let you get away ?
how did you get here ?
a bit of laughing and pushing around
he has everything a girl wants
nylons stockings chocolate and whiskey
oh i love him !
no i have no time
you 'r e still alive ?
yes strange huh with all those people trying to kill us
i thought UNknown had shot you
we UNknown e been in hiding for weeks
we just got home half an hour ago
who says you are not trying to leave ?
what do you mean child ?
i am about to be picked up by canadian field security
good then we UNknown l join you
we UNknown l wait in your office
ludwig what 's wrong with you ?
so you think i am guilty for the disastrous attack ?
yes and for the UNknown of your jewish clients
most of them knew him for years
what would be my gain ?
by stealing of what they entrusted you with
you betrayed him where the microphone was
the hold up was your idea
you let hans and his men get slaughtered
wait a minute wait a minute
i wasn 't the only one
UNknown knew all this as well
but nobody will have his own son killed
every man has unknown depths
may i show you something ?
while we were in hiding
my wife and i tried to put things in perspective
and we came to a radical conclusion
didn 't we darling ?
you UNknown l have to join us by going to the canadian police
as a lawyer i can 't
i have to keep you UNknown
that will be the canadians
every suspect deserves a fair trial
there 's ellis de UNknown
take of his cuffs john
in this report a collaboration is being described between m UNknown and a certain mr UNknown
why is this man getting involved colonel ?
general k UNknown has very kindly offered to clear up this mess
a UNknown in heart and soul
he and m UNknown haven been conspiring in the last few months
he was negotiating with the communists colonel our future enemy
you UNknown e got a nerve k UNknown
i consider m UNknown a liar who will say anything to save his own skin
of course who wouldn 't ?
we UNknown l get to the bottom of this
take him to his cell
this is a death warrant
m UNknown has been sentenced to death for high treason
the UNknown of german law are none of my concern
therefore the UNknown are UNknown and void
british military law does recognise the jurisdiction of german UNknown in the field
in article 153 to be exact
are you suggesting we shoot a witness ?
your own general UNknown has allowed us to discipline our own men
you can call him and ask
if you refuse to carry out a m UNknown 's sentence i will file a complaint with general UNknown
which you will no doubt regret
get up you 'r e going to church
come on bring your shit buckets
listen at the voice of god
maybe you can change your ways
we come to see traitors
heads up let me see your faces
maybe the rest has some to offer
all women naked on top
she sang for the krauts
she UNknown l certainly sing for us
the skies above are clear again so let 's sing a song of cheer again are you mocking me ?
take cover move away from the girl
make way for the fireman
stay away from my hose
soldiers have nothing to say down here
i am the boss here
of the prince 's staff
this is a UNknown scandal !
you 'r e just as bad as the nazi 's
within 24 hours you are out
dirty fascists you UNknown l be out of here within 24 hours
and those punks up there get out of here now !
just a moment mrs de UNknown
he was in the resistance
here don 't spend it all
i want to show you something
how did you get it ?
UNknown tried to get away with it
everything he robbed from the murdered jews
i got this from my father for my first performance
that bastard UNknown tried to make you an accomplice huh ?
i UNknown l talk to UNknown about that
or higher up with the prince
they UNknown l never believe you
i want to see him
it 's too insane for words
a canadian dick allowed that the krauts could finish the death sentence
this will calm you down
soon you UNknown l see your family again
i UNknown l get you you whore
let me go bastards let me go !
UNknown i think you 'd better go
can our own people do this ?
guys take over it 's for UNknown
a lady wants to speak to you
calm down please mr UNknown
about these dead people including your son
do you know who this is ?
from UNknown 2 onwards hans and his friends helped jews to find shelter
and clients of UNknown the banker
and UNknown who was a lawyer
the names that UNknown wrote down
all those men came to him for their money in order to flea to belgium
according to the red cross
none of them ever made it
lured to the UNknown and then murdered and robbed
were they patients of hans ?
no but my brother got an acute appendix problem
they asked UNknown for help who sent in doc hans
our good samaritan even operated him
not bad considering he wasn 't even a surgeon
then he called UNknown and turned them in
UNknown had van UNknown turn up and 2 days later they were dead
thank god the germans always made 15 copies of everything
3 weeks later UNknown wrote down
dr a got out due to lack of proof
he had his own people killed
so no one could ask where there jewish clients had been
did you arrest him ?
we just came from there
we have to get back
he 's trying to sneak away
where can he go to ?
i UNknown l call field security
a hearse has been seen near a blockade in the direction of 't UNknown UNknown
willi what 's happening ?
what 's happening UNknown ?
ellis is that you ?
let me out ellis please
just open the coffin ellis
ellis what are you doing ?
i 'm going to get you bitch
i 'm going to get you
you 'r e going to die
we should be opening his coffin by now
what do we do with the money ?
it belongs to the dead
what were you thinking about ?
it 's time for the maxwell family vacation !
hey dad you almost forgot my fishing pole
we wouldn 't want to forget that would we ?
some trout swimming around there have my name
well i guess here comes the UNknown
you are just saying that
i look like a whale
i think i forgot to tell mrs anderson to order more bibles for the sunday school
henry i know you 'r e the pastor but you can 't do everything
they UNknown l take care of it
you 'r e right honey
let 's enjoy our getaway
how much farther to the lake dad ?
we UNknown e been driving for an hour son
it takes five to get there
so we have four hours left right mom ?
you know i wanted peanut butter and jelly
that 's all we had honey
i thought we 'd be there by now
it 's not much farther
good because these mountain roads scare me
how is our patient doing doctor ?
his pressure is still little high so i 'm keeping him in an induced coma while we monitor head swelling
they were both pronounced at the scene
city rescue noticed the wife was pregnant and rushed her in
when they arrived there were faint UNknown on the UNknown
how is the newborn ?
she was just too premature
he should had a daughter
i appreciate the ride brother
there is nothing here man
this place looks dead !
thanks but this is as good a place as any
i UNknown l be fine
i 'm a hard worker
we have more UNknown this week
i 'm sorry to hear that
it 's really starting to cut into my bottom line
all i can say is once i 'm mayor your vacancy rate will be zero
we 'r e really going to make a difference around here
pretty soon the only thing i UNknown l have left is the restaurant
don 't worry my friend our plans and our agenda is out there and it 's winning UNknown everyday
first peter chapter two verse twenty one goes on to say
because christ suffered for you
therefore UNknown from the side of example
jesus shows how faith in christ helped to save men because of the pattern or character he displayed for their imitation
so what is jesus telling us ?
your weekly obligation to god is fulfilled
ladies and gentlemen as your mayor
i will bring back your jobs homes and the prosperity you once enjoyed
i promise to open businesses and create jobs
if you leave here with nothing else today
leave here remembering the word opportunity
opportunity for a new life
thanks it good to see you
excuse me sir where i can find a place to sleep ?
can i help you ?
i don 't do UNknown appointments
i 'm not here for an appointment
i just need a few minutes of your time
i was told there is a shelter here
no we don 't do the shelter anymore
how about some work maybe in exchange for a place to sleep for the night ?
sorry we don 't do those types of things here anymore either
i 'm an honest man looking for an honest day pay
can you help me ?
i 'm sorry i can 't help you
i wish i could but i can 't
are you alright pastor ?
you don 't look so good
things are really tough in this town right now
people just aren 't coming to church
lsn 't it when people need the lord most at tough times ?
but try to explain that to them
look i have a lot of things to do
i hope you find work and
virginia mildred i hope you 'r e both doing well
i 'm fine thank you james
you 'r e looking particularly lovely today
you said you have something important to tell me
you 'r e right let 's quit the small talk
small talk is a waste of time and money
well look who 's here
this is my partner soon to be mayor alex york
it 's nice to finally meet you ladies
york how do you do ?
let 's not mince words
the city of raymond is dying
the crime rate is UNknown
our rental income has been cut in half
i have a plan to turn things around
what do you propose ?
to open up a hotel casino
it will open up hundreds of new jobs and bring money flooding into the city
those jobs will be filled by people from town
then we can get your rental income back up
the rent should be even higher
but gambling is illegal in this city
and where do you plan on building the casino ?
do you have the land ?
the 1st church of raymond sits on the perfect location
it has freeway access high visibility and lots of parking
it 's up for sale
the church has been an institution here since the town was founded a hundred years ago
that institution is dying from lack of interest and funds
what i 'm suggesting is that we move the church 's location
we UNknown l build it in a family friendly spot it will be bigger and better
mildred there is a motion that will be presented to the raymond city council making gambling legal
with york as mayor we know it will pass
but why not wait until after the election to buy the land ?
things are really bad at the church right now and we can get it for pennies on the dollar
how much do you need ?
the mortgage is five hundred thousand
they 'r e in UNknown as we speak
what 's in it for you ?
i just want this town to be an example
i want fifty percent of the returns after you UNknown
so we take all the risk and you get half ?
we already have everything in place
i know you UNknown l make the right decision
ladies thank you for your time
i UNknown l show myself out
i have a feeling i UNknown l be back sooner rather than later
can i help you ?
i 'm new in town and i 'm looking for a little extra work
i 'm really good with my hands
what are you doing here ?
i told you ma 'a m i 'm looking for work
this is a real estate office
i don 't have anything for you to do here
i 'm an honest guy
i just need a little work
you gotta a big company here you must have some odd jobs i could help out with
i 'm not committing any crime
we have a lot of sandwiches left over from our meeting yesterday maybe we should give them to the man
feeding a man like that is like feeding a stray dog
give them one little thing and you will never get rid of them
throw that stuff in the garbage
i saw a man handing a man a twenty on a corner
when i heard him only ask for one
said do you really think it makes a difference ?
tell me why did you give him that much ?
he said i 'm just doing what i can do today
cause i might be in those shoes some day
looks like his chips are down
and i 'm just trying to help a brother out
can i help you ?
i 'm just enjoying the music
i 'm sorry but you gotta buy something to sit here
what 's the problem ?
this guy is refusing to leave
i 'm not refusing anything
look buddy you gotta buy something or hit the bricks
do you think i can work for something to eat
i can wash dishes anything i don 't care
he said i 'm just doing what i can do today
that was a long drive
i UNknown l have a coffee also
is there a sign saying fresh homemade apple pie in the window ?
well if it 's the best in town then give me a slice
so this is the kid from the UNknown tape ?
yeah he 's good isn 't he ?
yeah he sounds real good
you fellas don 't look like you 'r e from around here
we 'r e record producers up from la
we came here to see max
thanks for coming guys what did you think of my set ?
i think it will be even better when we get you playing more main stream stuff
i assume you 'r e interested in doing this full time right ?
i UNknown e dreamt about it all my life
and that 's why we 'r e here
but you will have to make some changes to your music
what kind of changes ?
changes to the style of music you play
we feel our songs will suit you better UNknown
i 'm ready to do whatever it takes
that 's what i wanted to hear
i think we can do a lot with you
what did we do ?
they 'r e going to give me a recording contract
this is the real deal
i am getting a ten thousand dollar advance
we 'r e going to be rich
i knew it ; sooner or later my boy would get discovered
just got it this morning
no more UNknown or food stamps we 'r e gonna be kings of the world
and you get to sing those beautiful songs you wrote
they 'r e giving me their own songs to sing
they said it 's main stream
you should open your mail more often
dorothy mccall 's daughter called
her mother is still in UNknown care waiting and hoping you visit and pray with her
oh the swanson 's called said they held off on the funeral as long as possible and decided to have the service without you
what else did they say ?
they said they were disappointed and wondered what kind of minister you are ?
it 's another letter from the bank
they UNknown e UNknown on the church
we have ten days to get out
they UNknown e sold the property
it looks like york and some other investors
you have to stop blaming yourself
i don 't want to talk about it
it 's sunday don 't forget to shave
i want to be the first one out
what are you smiling about ?
look at what i got a hold of
don 't get my hopes up unless you UNknown e got the goods
even the national UNknown can 't get the photos i have
where did you get these from ?
they aren 't stolen are they ?
let 's just say a friend of a friend took pictures of the pictures
eat your heart out richmond times
how 's that article on the new candidate alex york coming along ?
it 's going to run tomorrow
and after it comes out everyone is going to be excited about the gaming industry coming to raymond
i was hoping to see you
i read in the paper you are hiring part time workers
do you have newspaper experience ?
no but i promise i UNknown l do a great job
sorry we don 't hire inexperienced people here
what i lack in experience i will make up for with hard work
i don 't hire strangers never have never will
i know you 'r e hungry
this town is starving but it 's not food these people need
what do they need then ?
the bible says like newborn babies one must crave pure spiritual milk so that they can experience the full glory of salvation
what these people need is money jobs and a financial future
the lord wants us not to be greedy for money but eager to serve
how does serving the lord pay the bills or help build financial security ?
no offense but look at you
is it not more important to secure one 's position at his side in the place he has prepared for us ?
your name is burns ?
how do you know my name ?
betty i UNknown l be back in a minute
i heard you got arrested for robbery and assault
so i need money and got some anger issues
what 's it to you ?
i need a man that can get things done
what kind of things ?
things that pay fifty bucks
let 's see the money
i UNknown l give you twenty now and fifty more when you complete the job
my problem is the new bum in town
yeah i UNknown e seen him around
i UNknown l make him take a walk
you know where to find me to get the rest
would he throw up his hands and just walk away ?
are you writing a new song ?
just playing with some ideas
what is it again ?
keep it up never stop
let 's try to do your songs with my chords
it 's not finished but let 's finish it
would he walk among the sinners fall to his knees ?
heal the sick save lost souls the way he used to ?
would he throw up his hands and just walk away ?
cry a tear for a world that 's gone astray
i 'm not sure but god i wish i knew what would jesus do ?
i love it man !
would he throw up his hands and just walk away ?
i 'm not sure but god i wish i knew what would jesus do ?
you UNknown e become a problem
it 's time for you to leave
i 'm not ready to go yet
well it 's my job to make you ready
i feel your pain brother
what did you say ?
you feel my pain ?
you don 't know me
i 'm someone who 's no threat to you
what do you mean ?
i UNknown e walked where you walk
we UNknown e no less days to sing god 's praise
then when we 'd first begun
we UNknown e no less days to sing god 's praise
then when we 'd first begun
this is max 's last sunday with us
he will be moving on with his singing career and we wish him the best
i had a whole sermon prepared for today
but sometimes it 's better to come right out with it than beat around the bush
ladies and gentlemen while i am grateful to see you here today
i bring you sad news
the bank has sold our church to a group of investors
i am sad to say they are closing us down in a few days
this will be my last sermon
it is my understanding that this church is to be demolished and a new one will be built at a new location
as you all know my personal loss has taken a toll on my duties as your minister
when the new church is built
i will not be coming back as your pastor
let us bow our heads in prayer
our heavenly father we ask that you help us understand
i UNknown e been wondering
if i die in the next few days which is likely to happen
i would like the satisfaction of thinking that i said my say in a place like this
i don 't know of any teaching of jesus that makes one kind of a man less worthy of saving than another
do any of you ?
i UNknown e been in town for a few days trying to find a job and i UNknown e not heard a single word of comfort or sympathy
except from your minister who said he was sorry for me and hoped i would find a job somewhere
i understand that you can 't all go out of your way and hunt up jobs for other people
but what puzzles me is what does it mean to follow jesus ?
you sit in a church and talk about following jesus
you even sing songs about it
do you mean that you are suffering and denying yourselves the way he did ?
are you really following his examples ?
would he even consider helping the destruction of the church so a casino could be built in its place ?
would he take bribes from corrupt officials and run UNknown UNknown photographs in his newspaper ?
would he use his god given talents to lead young people astray ?
would he throw others out on the street just to make a buck ?
would he abandon his congregation and community at the most critical time because of his own personal issues ?
what would the world be like today if everybody tried to act as jesus did ?
so what is the lesson here ?
when you find yourself struggling with life 's difficult decisions ask yourself this one simple question
what would jesus do ?
how is he doing ?
the doctor said he is a sick man
probably in his final stages of cancer
the doctor is running some tests
he said there is probably nothing more that can be done
i just want to keep him here let him rest and make his last days as comfortable as possible
i haven 't seen you in months then twice in one week
what brings you here to see me ?
the thing in church the other day is really messing with me
a thing like that can be very UNknown
how is the man doing ?
the doc says it doesn 't look good for him
he came to my office looking for work the other day and i just ran him off
so you have been feeling bad since the incident ?
i don 't know how to describe it
it 's like an overwhelming emptiness
a sadness that i can 't shake
maybe you should seek professional help
lsn 't that what i 'm doing right now ?
i UNknown l help you anyway i can
i have some extra money
i UNknown e been here twenty years and
i UNknown e never gotten a donation like this
i just thought it might help
you are very kind but it 's going to take a lot more than this to save this church
i know reverend but it 's a start
well diana as you can see i 'm moving out today
but i UNknown l make sure this check get 's to the pastor of the new church
but what if we wanted our old church and pastor back ?
i don 't think that is possible
henry i have heard you many times preach that with god anything is possible
yes i did but i UNknown e come to doubt many of the things that i have taught over the years
have you lost your faith pastor ?
let 's just say i have been tested beyond my capacity to endure
i remember something else you taught us
the lord does not challenge us with more than we can handle
our best daily sales ever
what i lack in experience i will make up with hard work
i don 't hire strangers never have never will
that 's my cue to leave
i UNknown e been very happy with how you UNknown e been covering the election
this is the biggest buzz we UNknown e had over an election in years
is there a particular reason you dropped by to see me ?
i have some more pictures for you
you UNknown e been UNknown the pictures ?
i hope i can count on your newspaper for the election ?
we UNknown l see how it goes
don 't go soft on me now
what 's the matter ?
you must have some odd jobs i could help out with
honest or not leave or i UNknown l call the police
it 's the land deal isn 't it ?
i don 't think i want to do it
what do you mean you don 't know ?
we 'r e tearing down an institution of good for one devoted to evil
but we are going to build a bigger and better church
the whole event today has really made me think
you can 't base a business decision on the UNknown of a lunatic
i just don 't feel right about this land deal
i mean we are building a casino
that 's right a casino that 's going to give people jobs money self respect happiness and so on
since when did you start worrying about other people ?
i UNknown l pretend i did not hear that
what 's wrong with these ?
i don 't think they 'r e right for my audience
they 'r e a little too explicit
we have to shake things up
max trust me on this
i UNknown e been in this business a while and i know what sells
here is the advance i promised
if you 'r e going to be a star you gotta look like one
oh did you sign the contract yet ?
that church incident really shook me up it 's got my mind a little scattered
well get it un scattered
you need to concentrate on what 's important in your life
like signing that contract for UNknown
i know i just want to look it over again
i UNknown l get it to you in the morning
i need a little more time ok ?
i have a plane to catch tomorrow afternoon
i UNknown l come in the morning to get this signature
a package from our friend
we won 't run this stuff anymore
what 's wrong with you ?
nothing is wrong with me
i don 't want them in my paper any more
but these are ours exclusively !
i no longer want this filth in my paper
what has made you change your mind ?
if jesus was the editor do you think he would print this ?
diana let 's face it you UNknown e been under a lot of pressure lately
puerto rico jamaica sunny beaches
no what i want is to live my life as he would
but you 'r e not him ; for UNknown you 'r e a woman
i 'm not trying to be him
i 'm trying to live like him
i 'm so glad i turned down the profit sharing
what are you doing ?
so did you sign the contract ?
keep it up never stop
what 's going on max ?
but i can 't promote UNknown just so i can sing
how are we going to pay the rent now ?
what about my promise to your father to myself to give you a better life ?
i washed every single toilet in this town max
are you insane young man ?
i 'm so sorry mom
but i have to do this
max you 'r e being a fanatic !
what about when we 'r e living in the streets ?
mom if i have to live in the streets to stand up for what i believe in then so be it
he 's a very sick man
i UNknown l know more when his blood tests come back
i UNknown l be by to check on him the day after tomorrow
what do you want ?
where 's the story ?
don 't play coy with me
i 'm not running it
what makes you think you have a choice ?
this is my town everything in it is mine
we will see about that
are you prepared to lose everything ?
are you threatening me ?
get out of my office
heavenly father bring your life into my life
tell me what i must do to serve you
are you ok pastor ?
you don 't look well
things are really tough in this town right now
people just aren 't coming to church
lsn 't that when people need the lord most when times are tough ?
what are all of you doing here ?
can we talk with you a minute pastor ?
it 's about what took place in the church last sunday
you mean with the man ?
yes how is he doing ?
the doc checks on him each day
not much change in his condition
he 's sleeping right now
what he said made us all take stock of our lives
i 'm glad you all are searching for meaning in your lives
it 's almost as if he was sent to give us a message
remember what the stranger said
what would jesus do ?
and what do you think he would he do ?
he would save this church
it 's going to be torn down tomorrow morning
henry what 's happened to your faith ?
with faith nothing is impossible
if you UNknown e come looking for faith you UNknown e come to the wrong place
but shouldn 't we at least try ?
henry that 's right he called you pastor
be shepherds of god 's flock that is under your care serving as UNknown not because you must but because you are willing
let me get something straight with you right now
this ain 't going to be easy
that 's the old henry i once knew
but how are we going to do it ?
we are going to ask ourselves one simple question
what would jesus do ?
ok but how does that save the church ?
we all agree right now right here that whatever lies ahead of us we will act as he would act
so we are going to base all our decisions on what jesus would do ?
so who is with me ?
of course i 'm in
mr york are you sure this is right ?
i feel weird tearing down a church
son that 's not a church that 's a dried up old shell of a building
let 's tear this down
get out of the way henry !
i will not let you tear down this house of the lord
i UNknown e got a permit to tear this building down
if he won 't move then run him over
i 'm getting paid to tear a building down not run over a preacher
get off of there !
i UNknown l do this myself
i won 't say it again
get out of my way !
that book you 'r e holding won 't stop this UNknown !
i am the owner of this property and have paperwork from city hall stopping the demolition
we 'r e not tearing anything down today mr york
you are not destroying this church today
i have a permit to tear this building down
let 's pack it up boys
you may have won a small battle but i will still win the war
your mother is not going to be happy about this
then i guess it 's a good thing that i own the church and not her
you know we haven 't heard the last of him
let 's get inside come
thanks have a nice day
if anyone here is going to quit do it now
no one is going to quit
this is our church and we are going to save it
i 'm really proud of you virginia
i feel like a kid again
we UNknown e got a lot of work to do
i feel there is something i should tell all of you
i 'm partners with mr clayton in some of those low income homes that have been kicking people out
all this time and it was you ?
i 'm so sorry max
i was involved in that before i asked the lord into my life
max we all are different people now
you 'r e as bad as mr clayton
how dare you sit in this church ?
don 't say that please max
why should i forgive you ?
you were going to throw my family out in the cold
wait max because that is what jesus would do
he even forgave those who hung him on the cross
this is all pretty overwhelming
i will talk with mr clayton
we will move families back into their old homes
at the last city council meeting alex york introduced a motion to make gambling legal
if he becomes mayor the motion will pass
what are we going to do about this ?
we need to get to the root of the problem
we should take part in this coming election
put our own candidate in
that 's a great idea
how do we get own person elected ?
we need to take away that which gives him power
the people who have been drawn to him in town
thanks for coming out tonight everyone
mr york will say things are fine here in this town
he will lead you to believe that good times are ahead
but that is not what i see here
i see a place that has died
ladies and gentlemen listen to me bringing a casino to our city is not the answer
give me all your money
get behind the fence !
give me the cross !
ok i UNknown l take it
wait it 's caught somewhere !
it was a gift from my wife
thank you but why ?
don 't you remember me ?
i read about your crash and what happened to your family
do you remember how you spent all day trying to find me a job ?
and when i read about your family
i knew if that could happen to a man of god like you then there is no god
the lord has a plan for each and every one of us
my mother used to pray
i can see her now kneeling down by my bed when i was a kid
didn 't help her either
maybe i can help you
the devil 's UNknown on me already
what did you say ?
i said i feel your pain
my job is to make you ready
i feel your pain brother
that 's what the other man said to me
the man from your church
i trust you came to your senses
i want to buy some of your properties
some of the rundown buildings in the square
why would you want to buy those almost worthless properties ?
they are not worthless to the families that live there
you know about our church 's efforts
i would never believe you to be part of this non sense
i am very much a part of it
the problem is none of you are jesus
you know my son jimmy
he 's all i have left
a great kid but he doesn 't have the brains
i need to leave him with something
you want to leave him a bunch of run down empty flop houses when you could leave him a nice nest egg instead ?
i 'm fine but you almost hit me
you jumped in front of my car
i can 't believe you turned down the deal
i can 't believe i even considered it
i 'm considering reporting it to the da 's office
i really liked you virginia don 't spoil it
you 'r e hurting me
you 'r e hurting me
hey what 's going on over there ?
are you ok lady ?
i UNknown l deal with you later
how can i thank you ?
can i give you a ride home ?
i at least owe you a hot meal
you are the people that are trying to save the church
i 'm one of them
how did you know ?
hey i live on the streets
would you like to help us ?
sometimes i wish there was something i could do
what 's stopping you ?
what can i do ?
i struggle just to survive
but why would someone like you help me ?
because that 's what jesus would do
you can wear these till we get you some decent clothing
how did you become like this ?
i inherited this house from my
that 's not what i mean how did you become this way you know so nice kind ?
i haven 't always been a very good person but i 'm learning
what should i do with your clothing ?
you can put them in the trash
i never want to wear those clothes again
have a good night rest
i will see you in the morning
i don 't think you are a bad person
look what you are doing for me
like i said i 'm learning
what 's this all about ?
this doesn 't concern you
who did you bring home with you ?
a girl from the square
she 's in trouble and has no home
are you for real ?
that girl is going to rob us blind
she 's not a bad girl ; she is just down on her luck
down on her luck ?
the square 's full of people like that
she won 't be safe there
well then here take her to a hotel and give her money for food
mother for once can you forget about money !
are you going through some sort of guilt phase in life ?
no i am going through a learning phase
i will not stay in the same house with a miserable
mother this house is mine
dad left it to me
your are welcome to stay here as long as you like
but i must act as i believe jesus would in my place
you can always remember that you have driven your mother out of your house in favor of a homeless street girl
is that what jesus would do ?
i am not driving you out
i am helping someone who needs it
and yes i believe that is what jesus would do
how is the young girl doing ?
there was a very pretty young lady under all that dirt
have i ever given you a raise ?
well that is going to change starting tomorrow
maria over the past ten years you have been a true and loyal friend
you have been there every time i have needed you
i have not taken the time to stop and thank you for all your hard work
miss page you don 't have to say
yes i do and by the way from now on call me virginia
friends don 't call each other by last names
has anyone seen virginia ?
she went into town to have breakfast with reverend maxwell
sit down i UNknown l get you some breakfast
so you are the girl that my daughter brought home last night
yes your daughter is helping me get back on my feet
you are a pretty young lady you don 't look like you belong on the streets
no one belongs on the streets ; you don 't plan to end up there sometimes it just happens
well how did you end up in the square ?
my father left my mother and i when i was ten years old
we were basically left with nothing
my mother worked very hard to try and make ends meet
she cleaned houses during the day and waited tables at night
thank you this looks wonderful
things were really tough for us
then when i was fifteen she started to get sick
she died of cancer a year later
and i have been on my own ever since
what about your family ?
i don 't have any that i know of
well young lady you have one now
maria bring the car around
we UNknown e gained fifty new members since our last meeting and support is growing
soon we will be able to win back our church
virginia has agreed to run against alex york
it is imperative that alex york does not turn our town into an unholy nightmare
pastor how are we going to do this ?
by offering the people what he cannot
love understanding and most of all an example of how to live
it 's been nice having you here these last few days
it 's been nice having a roof over my head
you need more than a roof over your head
a young girl like you needs a home
i UNknown e learned that dreams don 't always come true
oh by the way i forgot to give you something
they 'r e a new set of keys to the house
UNknown but that 's your last name
loren i want you to come and live with me
i want you to be my daughter
ladies and gentlemen soon i UNknown l introduce to you the person who will clean this town return the pride to raymond california
our candidate and the next mayor virginia UNknown !
i want you to know
since we started crime has been reduced 55 and soon we will be able to return all of you to your homes
look it 's york !
how can you do this to yourselves ?
to even consider these jesus freaks ?
you still have no jobs no real future and to top it off you have to live in the shadow of fear and UNknown
i UNknown e been working months to bring great things to raymond
they want you to live in fear of what happens when you stray from the jesus pitch ?
there are two worlds we can build in raymond
one is built on the UNknown of peace kindness and good will
the other is an empty life of cheap thrills ugliness and greed
we are offering you the first
but you need to take the first step and reject this man and the easy path
you have to do what 's right
i 'm ready to defend this town
we are talking about jobs health insurance
low cost housing what else could you possibly want ?
you don 't need them
the man in the church that day was right
we have to do what is right in our hearts
where are you going ?
you 'r e done york
you fools what are you doing ?
you won 't make a difference on election day
go ahead and have your little meeting
it will all be over when i win the election
don 't you get it !
i am what they need not a bunch of jesus freaks
alex york lost his bid to become mayor of raymond today
our new mayor virginia UNknown and she hopes to bring new hope to raymond
henry how is he doing ?
this morning when i went in to check on him he was gone
i guess it was his time to move on
excuse me i need to get this started
ladies and gentleman can i have your attention please ?
first off let 's hear it for our new mayor virginia page !
did he just wink at you ?
stop it mom we 'r e in church
is there something going on with you two ?
well he did invite me to the church picnic
open your bible to first peter chapter 2 verses eleven and twelve
dear friends i urge you as aliens and strangers in the world to UNknown from sinful desires which war against your soul
live such good lives among the UNknown that though they accuse you of doing wrong they may see your good deeds and glorify god on the day he visits us
before i go on i would like to ask our good friend max walker to come up here on stage
i UNknown e asked max to play his new song for us
over the last month or so we UNknown e done a lot of good and changed a lot of things around here
we did it by asking ourselves one simple question
i wrote this song with a friend
they stopped saying prayers in school yesterday and there 's a boarded up run down church down on third and main
the mission 's overflowing and the crime rate just keeps growing and i 'm not sure where it 's gonna stop
but man this world is all we got
what would jesus do in time like these ?
would he walk among the sinners fall to his knees ?
heal the sick save lost souls the way he used to ?
would he throw up his hands and just walk away ? cry a tear for a world that 's gone astray
i 'm not sure but god i wish i knew what would jesus do ?
what if he appeared right where you stand ?
could you look him in the eye reach out and take his hand ?
show him how we are changing this place day by day with his amazing grace ?
it doesn 't look like heaven on earth
so i have to ask are we doing right ?
what would jesus do in times like these ?
would he walk among the sinners fall to his knees ?
heal the sick save lost souls the way he used to ?
would he throw up his hands and just walk away ? cry a tear for a world that 's gone astray
i 'm not sure but god i wish i knew what would jesus do ?
would he throw up his hands and just walk away ? cry a tear for a world that 's gone astray
i 'm not sure but god i wish i knew what would jesus do ?
what would jesus do ?
who 's there ? !
who 's there ? !
what do you want ? !
some say the world will end in fire
from what i UNknown e tasted of desire i hold with those who favor fire
but if i had to perish twice
i think i know enough of hate
to say that for destruction
you know i UNknown e got an english final
UNknown i will if you marry me it 's called a compromise
it 's just called UNknown
is a piece of paper
where i am from it 's the way one says i love you
where i come from at my age
it 's the way one says i just got knocked up
so you 'r e worried about what people will think
you know it 's two out of three marriages end in divorce
well i think you UNknown l find the
vampire human divorce rate is a little lower
i have to be back at four

we UNknown e been tracking the situation in seattle for a while
if the situation gets anymore conspicuous the UNknown will step in

the way he watches you
it 's like he 's willing to leap in front of you and take a bullet or something
is that a bad thing ?
it 's an intense thing
you 'r e different with him
i just want to make sure you 'r e making the right choices for you
you know cause you 'r e the one who 's gonna have to live with him
i didn 't want you to spending you 'r e money
i didn 't come on
i saved UNknown m all
i thought they 'd make a good quilt
to keep you warm up in alaska
the three headed lobster in maine
i 'm glad you UNknown e like it
i just figured you know when you get older have kids
we can add to it
i 'm glad you like it
you sure this is where you saw her ?
she 's in their territory
she UNknown l get away !
no she won 't !
it was really great to see my mom
just really hard saying goodbye
it doesn 't have to be goodbye
is that why you ask me to go ?
you thought i was gonna change my mind
if i asked you to stay in the car would you ?
to visit my mom why ?
just checking to see if you 'r e still human
i 'm coming here to warn you
if your kind come on our land again
you didn 't tell her ?
just leave it alone jacob
emmett and paul had a misunderstanding there is nothing to worry about
did you lie to get her out of town too ?
she has a right to know
i was trying to protect you
why haven 't you called me back ?
i had nothing to say
edward you have to trust me
it 's him i don 't trust
we 'r e just going for a ride
are you sure this is a good idea ?
i 'm a vampire girl remember ?
i 'm glad you 'r e here bella
maybe we can get a break from jake 's UNknown inner UNknown
i wish bella would call
i wish bella wouldn 't call
maybe i should call bella
maybe i should call bella and hang up
alright you can shut up now
bella this is UNknown UNknown
i 'm really sorry about your father
if you 'r e here to torture jacob some more feel free to leave
i was wondering when we 'd see your face around here again
sam we 'r e good ?
she won 't be getting through our line anytime soon
so when did UNknown joined the pack ?
around when her dad died
her brother seth also UNknown
one of the youngest we UNknown e had
sam keeps him home studying but he 's UNknown at the bit
wish it was UNknown who 'd stay home
come on don 't be such a guy
you know a triangle thing
we all have to live the UNknown sam emily pain UNknown
so sam dumps UNknown for emily ?
it wasn 't like that
sam hates himself for hurting UNknown
but emily was the one
yeah i guess it 's sort of chooses you sometimes
it 's more than some crush bella
do i want to know what that is ?
UNknown on someone is like
like when you see her everything changes
all of a sudden it 's not gravity holding you to the planet
it sounds like you know the feeling
have you UNknown on someone ?
you 'd know if i had
i just have a direct line to sam 's thoughts
so for now you 'r e still you
you knew this was gonna happen
not in a month !
i mean not before you UNknown e you UNknown e even lived !
for a second just a second i thought
but he 's got his hooks in you so deep
i decided this not him
bella they 'r e not even a live !
it makes me sick !
better you really be dead than one of them
i can 't believe you said that
edward was right i shouldn 't have come
edward could at least respect meal times
do you understand how worried i UNknown e been ?
i almost break the treaty to make sure of it
i know i smell like a dog
edward what 's wrong ?
someone 's been in here
i didn 't recognize his scent
a UNknown passing through ?
a UNknown by wouldn 't have left bella 's father alive
his scent disappeared about five miles south of bella 's house
i would UNknown e seen her deciding
it has to be the UNknown
i don 't think it 's the UNknown either
i UNknown e been watching UNknown 's decisions too
we also take shifts guarding bella at her house
you can 't protect me watch my dad and search for the intruder
i 'm not leaving you here defenseless
well i 'm not gonna let you starve
whoever it was he left his stink behind
it UNknown l be hard to miss when we cross it again
we UNknown l handle it from here
i could care less what you need
alright we 'r e done here
i 'm tired of this
from now on i 'm switzerland okay ?
edward hated the idea but it wasn 't about UNknown anymore
it was about my safety and charlie 's
in the days that followed i got them to at least try to work together
the wolves took over so the cullen 's can hunt
it wasn 't exactly an easy alliance
doesn 't he own a shirt ?
i 'm good here you should go
i 'm not gonna be going long
so UNknown wanna do today ?
or we 'r e going to a party tonight
you sure this is okay ?
i really hate being a party UNknown
the council leaders dad UNknown 's grandpa and sue UNknown
she took over for harry when he died
okay i should not be here
i mean they thought it would be good for you to hear the UNknown
the tribe 's UNknown ?
aren 't they secret ?
we all got a role to play
and you 'r e a part of this
i mean it 's the first time seth UNknown and UNknown are hearing them too
if i haven 't known that i wouldn 't believe you
it 's about time you got here
paul 's been UNknown the grub
but i saved you some UNknown
bella this is seth UNknown UNknown 's brother
newest member of the pack
the UNknown have been a small tribe from the beginning
but we UNknown e always had magic in our blood
we were great spirit warriors
shape UNknown that transform into the powerful wolf
this UNknown us to scare off our enemies and protect our tribe
one day our warriors came across a creature
it looked like a man but it was hard like stone and cold as ice
our warriors sharp teeth finally tore it apart
but only fire would completely destroy it
they lived in fear the cold man was not alone
she took her vengeance out on the village
our elder chief taha UNknown was the only spirit warrior left to save the tribe after his son was killed
taha UNknown 's third wife could sees that he would lose
the third wife 's sacrifice distracted the cold woman
long enough for taha UNknown to destroy her
over time our enemies have disappeared
our magic awakens when they near
and we sense it now we feel the threat in our blood
and we must all be ready
what did you do to me ?
we UNknown l find you someone to drink
just try not to get killed will you ?
i 'm gonna need numbers
seattle is in a state of terror
police are UNknown by the UNknown murders and UNknown
theories range from a vicious new gang to a wildly active serial killer
we 'r e going to have to do something
it takes more than one of our kind to cause the damage they 'r e reporting
they 'r e UNknown conspicuous
what like new vampires ?
in their first few months after the change
that 's when we 'r e at our most UNknown vicious insane with thirst
something to look forward to
no one has trained these UNknown but this isn 't random
someone 's creating an army
oh now we definitely going to seattle
an army of vampires ?
and they UNknown e been created to fight someone
we 'r e the only clan even close to seattle
regardless of who are they were may if we don 't put a stop to them the UNknown will
i 'm surprised they UNknown e let it go on this long
maybe they 'r e behind it
in italy i read UNknown 's mind
he wants me and alice to join him
he knows we 'd never choose him as long as our family is still alive
this kid riley UNknown disappeared over a year ago
and his poor parents been UNknown seattle with these things ever since
you think they should just give up ?
i have to figure out what to tell people
UNknown i won 't be home for UNknown
why i won 't visit
why they UNknown l never see me again
why are you so against me becoming like you ?
i UNknown e told you
i know the consequences of this choice you 'r e making
i UNknown e lived through it and to let you suffer that
you believe i have a soul
but to risk yours just for the sake of never having to lose you
it 's the most selfish thing i UNknown l ever do
i won 't be you know warm
and won 't smell the same
you UNknown l always be my bella
my bella just less fragile
gosh it 's so pretty here
so alice is planning a big graduation party
which you 'r e invited to
but now i 'm out of time
you need to hear the truth bella
that i 'm in love with you
and i want you to choose me instead of him
i don 't feel that way for you
i don 't buy it
what don 't you buy ?
that 's how i feel
you feel something else for me you just won 't admit it
so i 'm not giving up
i 'm gonna fight for you
until your heart stops beating
well then you 'r e not gonna have to fight for long
you 'r e rushing into it because you 'r e afraid you UNknown l change your mind
i know what i want
you wouldn 't have to change for me bella
or say goodbye to anybody
i can give you more than him
i mean he probably can 't even kiss you without hurting you
if you ever touch her against her will again !
don 't do this !
she 's not sure what she wants !
don 't do this !
well let me give you a clue !
what 's going on ?
and she broke her hand
it 's just a sprain should heal fairly quickly
trying to walk and chew gum at the same time again bella ?
you 'r e gonna be one tough little newborn
tough enough to take you on
don 't worry about it
no sign of the intruder
but victoria continues to make appearances
i don 't understand what i did to make you hate me so much
i don 't hate you
i don 't particularly like you but
but you do and you 'r e choosing wrong
i don 't care how miserable your human life is
my life is not miserable
everything as i still wanted
to be married with a nice house and a husband to kiss me when he came home
a family of my own
royce king was the most eligible bachelor in town
i was in love with the idea of love
on the last night of my life i left a friend 's house late
i wasn 't far from home
we UNknown e been waiting for you
isn 't she lovely john ?
i told you she was a looker
it 's hard to say with all those clothes on
what do you say rose ?
why don 't we take off a few layers ?
hey where do you think you 'r e going ?
hey you UNknown l do as i say !
they left me in the street thinking i was dead
believe me i wanted to be
carlisle found me he smelled all the blood
thought he was helping me
i got my revenge on them
i saved royce for last so he 'd know i was coming
i was a little theatrical back then
things got better after i found emmett
but we UNknown l always be this
that 's what i miss the most the possibilities
sitting on a front porch somewhere
emmett gray haired by my side surrounded by our grandchildren their laughter
i understand that 's what you want
but there 's nothing i UNknown l ever gonna want more than edward
you 'r e wrong again
after you UNknown e been changed there 's one thing you UNknown l want more
what did i say about low profile ?
bigger than any of us alone
and if you can 't control yourselves
we 'r e all going to die
what 's done is done just clean up after yourselves
they UNknown e already drawn too much attention
maybe we should consult with UNknown
UNknown 's decisions are being watched
either we let them do what they were created for
when we were five they asked us what we wanted to be when we grew up
our answers were things like UNknown president
or in my case a princess
when we were ten they asked again and we answered rock star cowboy or in my case a gold UNknown
but now that we UNknown e grown up they want a serious answer
well how about this who the hell knows ?
this isn 't the time to make hard and fast decisions this is the time to make mistakes
take the wrong train and get stuck somewhere
fall in love a lot
major in philosophy because there 's no way to make a career out of that
change your mind and change it again because nothing is permanent
so make as many mistakes as you can
that way someday when they ask what we wanna be we won 't have to guess
what 'd you think of my speech ?
too easy breezy too self helpful ?
i love this song let 's go
what are you doing here ?
you invited me remember ?
was my right hook too subtle for you ?
i 'm sorry about you know
the kiss and your hand
i 'd blame it on the whole inner animal thing
but it was really just me
i UNknown l be right back
alice what did you see ?
the decision 's been made
what 's going on ?
they 'r e coming here
they UNknown l be here in four days
this could turn into a blood bath
who 's behind it ?
he 's local riley UNknown
he didn 't start this
whoever did is staying out of the action
they must be playing with the blind spots in your vision
either way the army is coming and there aren 't enough of us to protect the town
what are they after ?
they were passing around bella 's scent
they 'r e after bella ?
what the hell does this mean ?
it means an ugly fight
you UNknown l get yourselves killed UNknown
do you believe sam will agree to an understanding ?
they UNknown l give us the numbers
and the UNknown won 't know they even exist
that UNknown l give us an edge
we UNknown l need to UNknown
carlisle they UNknown l gonna get hurt
we UNknown l all need some training
fighting UNknown requires knowledge that jasper has
this is what we do
look at us working together
it 's a graduation present
jasper has experience with UNknown
he UNknown l teach us how to defeat them
they want to know how the UNknown is differ from us
they 'r e a great deal stronger than us because their own human blood UNknown in their tissues
our kind is never more physically powerful than in our first several months of this life
that 's why they are created
a newborn army doesn 't need thousands like a human army
and no human army could stand against them
the two most important things to remember are first
never let them get their arms around you
never go for the obvious kill
they UNknown l be expecting that
never turn your back on your enemy
some of you are gonna get hurt
some of you could get killed because of me
it 's gonna be a hundred times worse than this right ?
are you sure there 's nothing i can do to help ?
your presence alone your scent will distract the UNknown
how do you know so much about this ?
i didn 't have quite the same upbringing as my adopted siblings
all the training the confederate army gave me was useless against the UNknown
still i never lost a fight
this has happened during the civil war ?
i was the youngest major in the texas cavalry
i was riding back to UNknown after evacuating a column of women and children
you 'd better do it maria
i can never stop once i UNknown e started
what 's your name soldier ?
major jasper UNknown ma 'a m
you maybe of a great use to me
maria was creating an army ?
they were very common in the south
and cost a brutal battles for territory
i was the second in command
my abilities to control emotions served her well
an endless occupation since she never let them live beyond their first year
it was my job to dispose of them
i could feel everything they felt
i thought what maria and i had was love
but i was her puppet
i didn 't know there was another way
now she 'd seen me coming of course
kept me waiting long enough
my apologies ma 'a m
i don 't know what i 'd have become without her
you UNknown l never have to be that again
alice would UNknown e seen if she wanted to make an army
unless she 's hiding behind them and she 's letting someone else decide
i 'm not just gonna hide while you 'r e taking all the risks for me ?
if it 's victoria involved
i need to keep you as far away from the fight as possible
jasper said that i could be of help
we won 't need your help
with the wolves in this it 's an easy win
the rest of us aren 't gonna have enough to do
okay either it 's so dangerous that i have to hide
or it 's so easy that you 'r e gonna be side blind which is it ?
it 's dangerous for you
it 's easy for us
i think it 's dangerous for us to be apart
how many times we have to prove that ?
i UNknown l be worrying
you UNknown l be worried
and we il both feel more horrible
okay you 'r e right
so i 'm coming with you
no we UNknown e got to stay away together
i can 't make you choose between me and your family it 's
the only way i can protect you is to be with you
you 'r e not fighting ?
what you pull a muscle or something ?
just tell me the plan
this field will give us an advantage in battle
we need to lure the UNknown with bella 's scent
it needs to end here
edward and i are going on a UNknown
even if he carries me they UNknown l still pick up our UNknown
your stench however is revolting
dude you really don 't want to start comparing stinks
they won 't want to get anywhere near his odor
okay let 's just try it
you gonna ask me to sit out the fight too ?
or don 't you care about my safety ?
of course i care but you 'd say no
so i won 't have a choice anyways
since i let sam be alpha male
i got to live with the shots he calls
since you let sam be alpha ?
but every choice has it 's consequences
everybody makes choices you gonna have to accept mine
you can love more than one person at a time
i 'm not a wolf i can 't UNknown
it has nothing to do with UNknown
it has to do with
and i know you feel something for me
i promised i wouldn 't kiss you again until you asked
you 'r e going to be keeping that promise for a while chief
i told your father that our whole family 's going camping this weekend
so you and i are having a sleep over at my house
you guys run for the same basis now ?
actually you and edward will have the house to yourself tonight
we 'r e all going hunting UNknown up for the battle
do you want a sandwich ?
why didn 't you get remarried after mom ?
like you 'r e mother
it seem to work out fine for her the second time round
things that you need to think about it if you
don 't until we UNknown e enough of the talk
don 't you just quit
it 's just as embarrassing for me
as it is for you
and don 't bother UNknown UNknown mom beat you too early ten years ago
well you didn 't have a boyfriend ten years ago
please just don 't worry about that
like a code for something ?
liking edward a little bit more now
what are you doing here outside ?
it seems the only fair that i 'd be represented as well
i thought you might need one to sleep in
i think an air mattress would UNknown e UNknown
i want to negotiate my own condition
anything you want it 's yours
you UNknown e said that you wanted me to have every human experience
not the ones that support risk killing you
and everyone says once i 'm changed all i 'm gonna want is to slaughter the whole town
that part doesn 't last forever
while i 'm still me
while i still want you this way
i UNknown l go to some UNknown expensive college and let you buy me a car
i UNknown l marry you just try
stop trying to take your clothes off
believe me i want to
i just want to be married to you first
you really make me feel like i 'm some sort of like a villain trying steal your virtue or something
it 's not my virtue i 'm concerned about
it 's just one rule i wanna leave UNknown
it might be too late for my soul but i will protect yours
i know it 's not a modern notion
i 'm from a different era
things were a lot less complicated
and if i met you back then i would UNknown e courted to you
we 'd have taken UNknown UNknown or had iced tea on the porch
i may have stolen a kiss or two
but only after asking your father 's permission
i would UNknown e got down on one knee
and i would presented you with a ring
i promise to love you every moment forever
you 'r e not coming with us ?
it will be a last minute decision
i told you how it works
don 't underestimate them riley
you UNknown l have the numbers but they UNknown l be able to anticipate your every move
laurent found out about the things they could do and they killed him
but not before he told me
but we UNknown e been tearing it up and i UNknown e never even seen them here
you don 't trust me
i 'm just saying that
i 'm doing this for us
so that we can feed without their UNknown
i can 't live in fear anymore waiting for them to attack
i won 't let them
you 'r e going overboard
if this is all i can contribute i want to be thorough
the UNknown will be frantic
don 't make yourself uncomfortable
it doesn 't bother me anymore
since i spent 24 hours thinking you were dead
you 'r e not wearing your ring
well i didn 't want to risk losing it
or risk jacob seeing it ?
i think we should wait to tell him
i mean at least till after the fight
if you 'r e having second thoughts
i just want him to have a clear head
whose head is UNknown ?
alice says there 's a storm coming
yeah i can feel it
i UNknown l see you in a couple of hours
a bunch of vampires trying to kill me
you should get back before the storm hits
you UNknown l need my connection to the pack to keep tabs on what 's going on
you 'r e not going to fight ?
seth will spell me in the morning
he 's not happy about missing the action but it UNknown l keep him out of trouble
let 's get you inside
i should have chosen a site lower down
what can i do ?
she may need her toes someday
and let 's face it
i 'm hotter than you
get your hand off me !
get your hands off her !
she gets sick it 's on you
why ! you 'r e freezing bella
relax you UNknown l warm up soon
can you at least attempt to control your thoughts ?
but she 's in love with me too
she just won 't admit it to herself
i can 't tell you if you 'r e right
then let me ask you something
would you try to kill me ?
i couldn 't hurt her like that see you 'd just turn her into a UNknown demon like you
i don 't want that
but you gave up too quickly
if you 'd stayed away another six months
you have to consider that i might be better for her than you are
i know you can protect her
but you can give her a life a human life
it 's all i want for her
i 'm not going to force her into anything ever again
the last time i tried it almost killed us both
when you thought she was gone that you 'd lost her
how did you cope ?
there 'r e no words
but i wouldn 't wash it on anyone jacob
as much as i 'd love to kill you i 'm glad she 's warm
if we weren 't natural enemies and you weren 't trying to steal my reason for existing
but she could still change her mind you know
he 's checking to see if the woods are clear before he goes
i 'm really sorry about last night
i couldn 't have been easy on you
it definitely won 't make my list of top ten favorite evenings
you have a list ?
all ten i spent with you
this is the twenty first century
i always wanna UNknown my name
you knew he was listening ?
i 'm so done !
what can i do ?
you 'r e not thinking clearly don 't do that !
give me one good reason
because i don 't wanna lose you
it 's not good enough
because you 'r e too important
i 'm asking you to kiss me
that should have been our first kiss
but jacob 's thoughts are very loud
i don 't know what happened
she knew we weren 't there but she caught my scent
she knew you 'd be with me
victoria 's just using you to distract me
but she knows i UNknown l kill you
in fact she UNknown l be glad she doesn 't have to deal with you anymore
i told you about their mind tricks
i can read her mind so i know what she thinks of you
she only created you and this army to avenge her true mate james
you 'r e from forks you know the area
that 's the only reason she chose you
don 't let him do this to us
you know i love you
you won 't get another chance like this again
you want me to feel the pain you felt when i killed james
when i tore him to pieces
when i turned him into ash
the pack needs to leave
the UNknown won 't honor a truce with the UNknown
hold on carlisle is gonna take care of you
jake i 'm right here
i need to set the bones before his UNknown healing kicks in
we need to get him out of here
we 'r e not gonna win a fight with the UNknown
we UNknown l take him back to billy 's
i UNknown l be there as soon as i can
i UNknown e never seen a UNknown escape an assault of this magnitude intact
it 's not often we 'r e rendered unnecessary
we offered her asylum in exchange for her surrender
that wasn 't yours to offer
why did you come ?
you don 't need to do that
riley wouldn 't tell us
he said our thoughts weren 't safe
if the UNknown had knowledge of victoria they would UNknown e stopped her
she didn 't know what she was doing
we UNknown l take responsibility for her
the UNknown don 't give second chances
caius will be interested to know that she 's still human
take care of that felix
i 'd like to go home
it 's been going on for a while
doc 's UNknown his bones
why 'd he have to butt in ?
i could UNknown e taken that tick
oh give it a rest UNknown
he UNknown l be alright
i gave him some morphine but his body temperature will burn it off soon
i was worried about you
i guessed edward would read my thoughts
was he hard on you ?
he 's better than i thought
he 's not as perfect as you think
i know who he is
i must not talk about that
i 'd rather get all the UNknown done at once
at least i know i did everything i could
wasn 't easy making you admit your feelings for me
i only fought them because i know they wouldn 't change anything
i 'm exactly right for you bella
it would be as easy as breathing with me
you know i love you
you know how much i wish it was enough
should i come back ?
but i UNknown l always be waiting
UNknown my heart stops beating
yeah it 's a month before my birthday
i don 't need to be another year older than you
alice said she can get the wedding together by then
i 'm sure she can
i UNknown e chosen my life
i want to start living it
dress the reception the guest list
i mean who knows who she 's gonna invite ?
you 'r e trying to make everyone else happy
but you 'r e already giving away too much
this wasn 't a choice between you and jacob
it was between who i should be and who i am
i UNknown e always felt out of step
like literally stumbling through my life
i 'm never felt normal
because i 'm not normal
i don 't wanna be
i UNknown e had to face death and loss and pain in your world
but i UNknown e also never felt stronger more real more my self
because it 's my world too
it 's where i belong
i UNknown e made a mess trying to figure all this out but
i wanna do it right
and i wanna tie my self to you in every way UNknown possible
something a little more difficult first
we have to tell charlie
it 's a good thing you 'r e bulletproof
i 'm gonna need that ring
how come nobody pays cash anymore ?
people can 't always pay
i UNknown l make them pay
don 't you talk like that
he doesn 't stiff the electric company
they 'd cut him off
why can 't we do the same ?
because we 'r e better than that
rose hills land of the living dead
i hate going near that
don 't spill your apple juice there old man
uh where 's the manager ?
okay here 's your UNknown
and that 's including the last three months

it 's a shame somebody has to steal just to eat
well life ain 't fair mama
i thought i raised you with a heart
you did but sometimes it just gets in the way
well maybe it 's trying to tell you something

dr raymond moody author UNknown after life
will be speaking at the university
of south carolina thursday 4 00 p m
i went where you go when you die
i had one of those
oh hell UNknown this guy 's just another phony
he 's selling books is all
i got to go see him
what 's the worst thing that could happen ?
well he could tell you you 'r e not crazy
thus the vast majority of subjects
no matter what their religious or their cultural background may be all report UNknown similar experiences
now while i have met no single individual
who reports all of these UNknown
and there you have it
that 's what i call
i 'm not a professor
i was struck by lightning
i was dead for 28 minutes and while i was dead
these beings made of light they showed me my whole life and then i went to this city
it was a UNknown city and i went into this cathedral and there was more of them
there was 13 of them these beings
they showed me like movies
these things from the future
professor of medicine here at the university
this is all easily UNknown
when the human organism is dying
the UNknown is deprived of oxygen
in fact this oxygen UNknown
begins along the outer UNknown
and in effect moves inward
now with all due respect to our friend here
while i am sure that he had a UNknown experience
i doubt that he paid a visit to heaven
well doctor you are certainly entitled to your doubts
it 's mine as well
but my hobby 's believing
listen is everything you said in there true ?
i don 't know what 's true anymore
because if it is you UNknown e possibly had the most extensive experience that i UNknown e come across
and so what do you say to a beer ?
i 'm going to tell you something
i liked what that guy said in there
i liked it UNknown UNknown i came here to ease my mind
and if none of it ever happened like he claims
then i got what i came for
so i can just go home and forget about it
that 's just exactly what i 'm going to go and do
that 's a nice alley they got
got a good polish to it
that still ain 't worth beans
moody on the phone again

so you 'r e doing well
uh did you have any incidents ?
UNknown i 'm going to cut to the chase with you all right ?
your near death experience is
i UNknown l tell you something about my experience
but when i get my strength back
i 'm going to beat the life out of him
so get yourself another guinea pig doctor
i got a life and i like it
you don 't like it UNknown
you didn 't beat that guy up because you couldn 't
because you knew you shouldn 't
that 's a whole new feeling for you and you don 't know how to deal with it
have any dreams lately ?
i don 't think so
just what the hell do you want with me ?
i want to understand and you need to understand
i think that would work well UNknown
a little brown man from the islands can sure change the way you think
okay this one is for you
how many of these can we drink UNknown ?
well you better drink it all up
cause there 's a prize for you at the bottom
nothing says i love you all over again like diamonds
i don 't want it
you been doing more than playing horses
but it 's it 's like stealing danny
with your with your power
it just isn 't right and i don 't want it
well you didn 't want me crazy either and you didn 't want me a cripple and now and now my money isn 't good enough for you
why is that casey ?
why is it that i 'm the one UNknown
like some kind of freak
eating with my hands passing out
and i 'm the one feeling guilty ?
why is it that everybody wants me to be something different
but they don 't tell me what ?
i want it the way it was
the way it was when ?
hey you ain 't never been happy with the way i was
things ain 't ever going to be the way they was casey ever
come on let 's go !
hey need some help with that ?
no i can handle it
it 's one of those old caps
somebody jammed it on there so you push just like
what was all that about back there UNknown ?
something terrible terrible was about to happen
what 's going to happen danny ?
i got to talk to you
what i saw was what i was going to make happen
it 's not true UNknown
and the girl is dead
now you wanted to help me ?
you wanted to study me ?
you can 't change the future because you can see it
you can only try and change people
you can try and change their hearts their UNknown
set them on the right path
but it is up to them to follow it
what are you going to tell me
that 's going to make me feel any different
about being some kind of freak ?
how you going to fix that ?
a freak is only one person that 's different
there are a lot of people like you
and then they show me these events
you know from the future
cowboy actor with initials r r becomes president
that 's ronald reagan ?
who 'd vote for an actor ?
now what do other people who live say ?
UNknown you 'r e the first one that 's come back with a list
well they told me they said that
we 'r e not from here
we 'r e from there and that we 'r e all on the earth and doing god 's work
you know trying to fix it
and we 'r e all we 'r e all like soldiers
i like that being like a soldier and that you know some succeed and some fail but that
we 'r e all heroes just for being here
and then they said something about love
you know love being important to everybody and
what am i supposed to do with that ?
well what do you think you should do about that ?
well i don 't know
i was thinking maybe i might give it a try
what 's going on ?
what are you doing ?
what do you think ?
you need a new suit to do that ?
well i wanted to look my best
i just do not know
well i thought i 'd
i thought i 'd walk around town and
no one in this town wants your love
what makes you think you UNknown e been forgiven
for all you UNknown e done ?
not one person in this town hasn 't been hurt by you
now you decide it 's time for love
haven 't you done enough to humiliate us ?
it 's not about us case
damn right it 's not about us UNknown and it hasn 't been about us for a long time
it 's all about you
i didn 't choose this you know
but i don 't do something about it
i 'm going to lose my mind
what do you want ?
i was thinking that maybe you and me
could get us a beer
that UNknown l be the day
now why don 't you just get on out of here
before i take these UNknown to you
i don 't want no beer with you
and then maybe we can bury the old hatchet
then i can tell you what happened to me and you can tell people
you can spread the word cause everybody listens to you
i only wish they had sense enough to bury you when they had opportunity
isn 't it at least fair to give me a chance leonard ?
is that too much to ask for ?
when did you ever give anybody else a chance ?
ain 't you the guy that robbed my family 's store ?
i ain 't going to hurt you
hey you got a name ?
it 's david jack armstrong
i ain 't going to hurt you
how are you doing ?
just fine now that you 'r e here grace ann
ain 't you sweet ?
what can i get for you ?
i UNknown l have a couple of eggs sunny side up hash UNknown order of toast
can i have my eggs over easy ?
what do you think ?
now don 't fill up on crackers
hey baby you want to go out ?
you want to go out honey ?
well you 'r e not happy at all
why you so sad ?
take me home take me home
take me home take me home
guess i missed the train
does the number six bus come by here ?
they told me to love
they gave me the power to see and i hated everything i saw
people in this town they 'r e never going to forget and they sure as hell won 't forgive me
i 'm a mess raymond
i need you to help me
i have hurt people all my life
i got so much making up to do and i don 't think i 'm going to have the time to do it
i want to help people
i need to know what that feels like
i 'm going on a speaking tour in a few days
the well is poisoned for you here UNknown
you come where some people are willing to believe
people that want your help
i just don 't understand why you have to go to cincinnati
i 'm not going to cincinnati
i 'm going to all kinds of cities
hey baby i 'm only going to be gone a few weeks
and i UNknown l call you every single night i promise
what are you looking for UNknown ?
i 'm looking to get up in the morning and find out where i fit in
you 'r e going to be so proud of me
perhaps one day people will come to accept
that there is another dimension of existence
to which the soul passes after death
meanwhile to UNknown a friend of mine
people who UNknown e had these experiences know
will just have to wait
i need to know if my wife is cheating on me
he 's been missing a year
the one in the picture ?
how do you know that ?
what did that picture feel like in your hands ?
welcome to the world of knowing things
you 'd rather not know
UNknown for the power company
i grabbed on to a thousand UNknown line
it 's a pleasure to meet you
how do you do ?
i decided not to tell anybody because they 'd probably think i was crazy
so i just told my wife
how 'd she react ?
thought i was crazy but it 's not a big deal to her
it was a big deal to my husband
i couldn 't stop talking about it
and he didn 't want to hear about it anymore
yeah i thought i loved him
for the longest time he was all i wanted
well then why 'd you divorce him ?
how about you UNknown ?
her name 's casey and she understands
look i want to tell you something
i love you more than anything
we 'r e going to make it work
i UNknown l be home real soon and we will make it work
we been at this for three weeks and eight cities
and everywhere we go people
people keep treating me like i 'm some kind of UNknown
they all want something from me that i can 't give them
they all want me to make them think
it ain 't as bad as it seems and i can 't
i 'm beginning to feel like moses without a burning bush
something i been meaning to ask you raymond
why doyou believe in all this death stuff ?
i mean i went through it and i 'm not so sure
you never did and you 'r e totally convinced
what 's in it for you raymond ?
maybe i just want to believe
i ain 't buying that
got to be more to it than that raymond
i want to believe that death isn 't just UNknown
isn 't that what everyone wants ?
there 's got to be another chance to make amends to uh see people you UNknown e lost
maybe more important have them see you and know
know how much you miss them
i got to tell you raymond
i 'm calling it quits
i don 't want to think about nothing except casey
turn this up details are UNknown
at this point but we do know
that the UNknown plant is one of the soviet union 's largest
would you look at that ?
it 's a matter of time those old plants
the UNknown plant is located in the settlement of UNknown ten miles northeast of the city of UNknown in the soviet ukrainian republic
it is a desolate area and in fact
well how long you been trying to get ahold of us ?
we didn 't know where you were
there 's a minister outside mama
do you want to see him ?
for 40 years they UNknown e told us we 'r e all going to hell
and they think they 'r e going to comfort me ?
now what are you crying about ?
i 'm not going to go anyplace
well don 't be afraid mama
you 'r e going home
back to a place you UNknown e forgotten all about
the most beautiful place you ever dreamed of
don 't you see her ?
you mean that little dark haired girl ?
i never told you about her
that 's marion my little sister
she passed on when she was only 15
she used to follow me UNknown
i just couldn 't get rid of her
now what do you suppose she 's doing here ?
i don 't know mama
why don 't you go to her ?
a gift that UNknown gave her
i suppose i should thank you
but sometimes i wish that UNknown had never met you
oh just riding around thinking
i already said my good UNknown
i need too sometimes just so you know
ain 't a soul on the street
they 'r e all at the funeral
what 's it look like ?
well you look hungry to me
why don 't you get in ?
come on i ain 't going to bite you
what about this UNknown here ?
he ain 't half as dangerous as he looks
you got any egg rolls ?
got any egg rolls ?
that 's why we got lots of them
i don 't know what it is but it 's good
you just got back from denver this afternoon
that ain 't fair honey
it 's from people needing help
it isn 't fair to me
i never see you anymore
you 'r e never here
you 'r e answering letters or packing for your next trip
or your interview but you are never here danny
maybe i 'm being selfish for wanting you all to myself when you could be out helping other people but i loved you before any of them did
i loved you when no one else did
what do you see for us ?
what 's in our future ?
you got to say something
we 'r e on a roll
i saw you last month but my father 's become ill
he just wants to know what it 's like to die
is there a tunnel of light ?
oh UNknown thank you so much
i mean like i really love you you know ?
i need to know what UNknown l happen with casey
i see that all is well
and love will triumph over all
i UNknown e seen it and all will not be well
but you have to have faith
you don 't know what faith is
instead of with the one person who loves me
you don 't deserve to use the word
look baby i got some good news
i talked to a psychic today and she told me everything is going to be fine
she said we 'r e going to work everything out
isn 't that something ?
it 's just easier not to have you at all than to to have it like this
let 's get out of this goofy place
i got to go to the bathroom
you 'r e the guy that got hit by lightning right ?
you got e s p
and all that crap ?
you 'r e the guy i 'd like to have at the blackjack table
so what do you think huh ?
ten of hearts ace of clubs
i 'm going to kill him
i 'm going to kill him
let 's get to it
i 'm going to do you one better
i 'm going to teach you
how to use the power yourself without me
aw man that 's bull
you want some money ?
then shut up and listen to me
only catch is this using e s p to gamble it 's sort of like cheating
so if i teach you this power
and you win say a hundred 200 000
what you got to understand is that
all right let 's go for it
i thought i might see you again
why did you do this ?
because i wanted to be free
i wanted to just go to sleep
they found me but i beat them
i was dead for over ten minutes
i had what you would call a bad trip
i was burned alive and and dogs tore me apart
and ripped my skin and i never died
i felt all of it
i couldn 't even escape in death
oh honey death is not an escape
where can you go to stay away from him ?
i don 't know what i 'd say to her
you know how much money i lost because of you ? ! and you you whore
get your things and get out of here
don 't hurt me man
i ain 't going to hurt you
you ever go near her again i will hunt you down
don 't let me do it
don 't let me do it
looks like a UNknown 8
don 't seem like there 's much to talk about these days
hell we could talk about beer
you UNknown e been known to
so what happens now ?
hell we 'r e more than that
better get that finger looked at
ah it 's all right
you 'r e starting to look a little green
i just need some air
ain 't you pretty ?
darling to tell you the truth
this is a compound fracture
how long have you had this ?
why didn 't you have it fixed ?
i didn 't get around to it
what has that got to do with anything ?
because it is badly infected and the infection has spread and damaged your heart
it was already badly damaged by the lightning
you 'r e fast approaching cardiac arrest UNknown
we 'r e going to need you to sign this
nobody 's going to keep me from going this time
just leave it over there
we UNknown l give UNknown some time to think about it
i ain 't going to change my mind doc
i ain 't going to change my mind
ain 't nothing you going to say is going to change a thing
i heard that people who have died aren 't afraid to do it again
it 's my time raymond
they can fix you up
are you killing yourself UNknown ?
didn 't you say you 'r e supposed to let death choose you ?
the chances of you dying on that table in there are pretty damn good anyway
if you don 't die maybe you got some work left to do
of course you realize you UNknown l have to sign them yourself don 't you ?
i 'm going to be putting you under
don 't worry about a thing
want to do it anymore
who you are is a difference that love makes
this is my little sister marion
hey you come sit here
you know that 's not really good for you
i been struck by lightning
and had open heart surgery
what 's that for ?
oh hey i 'm sorry
oh don 't be sorry
i died on that table
you won that money fair and square
i had to come back again
ain 't no rest for the weary
what exactly do you do here ?
i help people with the last five minutes
when the end comes everybody wants five more minutes
they want to say things left UNknown
they want to maybe love one more time
and i 'm able to give them those five minutes
then i let them go
people are afraid of death
and when i get through here it 's going to smell like roses
they showed me that if i hurt someone
but if i helped someone
and the people i helped well they would go away and they would help somebody else so the only true power in life is the power to love someone
you are all powerful spiritual beings
just for the record of the proceedings here
what is your academic UNknown
i was in town and heard you were speaking
thought i 'd drop by
it seemed kind of like fate
sorry i wasn 't there
you were there the first time
you know danny when you died
i missed you so much
i even told god i 'd take you back with all your anger
but when you did come back
i missed you even more
yeah i guess i do
you got to be careful what you wish for
that was a wonderful speech
thank you overwhelmed by your speech
i 'm so proud of you
my UNknown would like to talk with you

i 'm not the princess
i am not the princess
i am not the princess !
what do you mean ?

now i am the emperor
i am the emperor of course i recognize my own sister
someone told me that when you were on the way home you were left alone in the boat by the general
but luckily you were alive
this is really luck !
ask some doctors to visit her

if you came home earlier you would have got troubles !
what is it about ?
million UNknown brought his daughter here to seek for advantage !

please take him into the house
bro this guy has gone UNknown

long life to empress dowager
i have brought you some cakes
you loved these cakes when you were a kid come on
your highness come and take a seat
you 'd greet her queen mother not your highness
when you were small your king father sent you to study abroad
that 's why you lived alone for a decade
it 's just a tough time for you !
your highness take a seat please
your queen mother has been missing you badly she got sick !
come on the towel please
i don 't need it
i am not sick now
i am so happy to meet my girl again i feel so good now !
1 more 2 more 3 more 4 more
isn 't it fate ?
so just let it be !
what did you say ?
queen mother i want to show you how i walk
isn 't it what you have learnt from abroad ?
hey where is my mother ?
who hanged my mother up there ?
maybe she likes being hung like that
it 's so funny !
hang him over there too
watch my finger stance !
what 's the matter with you ?
please don 't bother me from practicing
what am i practicing ?
you walked in a weird way and thus confused me
so let 's forget all those practicing and tonight we will
i don 't care what you are thinking and talking
anyway stop saying anything nonsense to me
queen i think you have forgotten my wish
let me tell you one more time
i want to practice hard
in order to acquire enough power to protect the citizens of our kingdom
i want to stop crimes
i want to keep the peace of the universe
however in order to acquire super power
i must be a virgin
my dear nephew you are home !
i was appointed as the scholar at last !
your dad is the senior official now you won the glory for the family !
auntie you 'r e right !
where is dad now ?
your father just made me angry !
he wants to give you hard time with some outsiders
auntie what is it about ?
without your consent he agreed to marry you with someone before your birth
i am so proud of you to be the scholar !
we UNknown l have double happiness if you get married soon
dad marriage is a serious issue
i have already in love with someone
you have got a lover ?
i will back you up !
well you go in there give her a glance
then tell her that you won 't marry her
for the rest i UNknown l fix it for you
thank you my dear auntie
what is your lover ?
how did you meet her ?
i wanted to buy a bag for carrying my reference books
it 's fate that made me meet her
she is so pretty i am fascinated
my heart beat fast i just couldn 't control myself
this bag is of limited production only 10 are sold
i offer is 30 taels
what are you looking ?
don 't you think it doesn 't look good on me ?
my offer is 50 taels
it doesn 't worth that much !
shopping here you shouldn 't care the price
as long as you buy something you like
a pretty bag should go to a pretty woman
at that time i know we fell in love at the first sight
but she didn 't take that bag
and this bag became the pledge of our love
we agreed that on the day i was appointed the scholar our love story would be continued
is she stupid or innocent ?
if i were her i would have taken the bag away for re sale
no matter what i want to marry her
what a pity that she didn 't appear as promised
perhaps she fell for another gentleman
we fell in love at the first sight
i would suicide for love if our love story fails to continue
my dear son don 't be silly !
i UNknown l search her for you
her name sounds as good as her voice
the stammering beggar is in the kitchen
you must be UNknown jin !
come here please this is your UNknown e
that 's good news !
hey do you want to dump my girl ?
it 's not my fault at all
what do you suggest ?
i don 't want to force my son to do something he dislikes
okay you can blame me of breaking the promise
since you ruin the reputation of my daughter it is a must to pay us money
i am good at bargaining
step aside it 's dangerous !
i am going to praise my daughter in front of you
she is sweet and pretty many guys want to woo her
but she knows she must marry him but no one else
when she arrived you refused to marry her
no matter what i said you have enough excuses to reject her
i see you want to rap don 't you ?
it 's insane of you to ask for so much money
i can hear nothing about your request
i would like to offer what i want to offer
if you want to mess up you UNknown l get no penny at all
she is worth nothing !
she stammers which makes me laugh and tease
i don 't see any good of her
so i would only offer you a UNknown as compensation
i offer a million and you counter offer one UNknown ?
you 'r e not sincere enough
this is so called bargain !
take it or leave it
you counter offer with your poisoned lips
and this isn 't a reasonable bargain at all
okay i will have a discount of 10 000 taels
i won 't pay cause she is not worth
i think i am wasting my time to bargain with you
i don 't want to waste my time anymore
i UNknown l give you one more UNknown then disappear right now !
you brought us good meal yesterday didn 't you ?
miss said that you might become our in law the day before
but today you have become a jinx
so we won 't serve you good meal anymore
so let 's wait and see your reply !
auntie why are you addicted in such game ?
have you found your miss right ?
please help me to up date my photo
i want big eyes and high nose
and good figure of course
don 't you show others your real look ?
playing UNknown love for long time is no fun !
who knows what is true or false ?
but how can you seek for true love on paper ?
well this is the one
we almost reached a stage of dating
why didn 't you date him ?
i sent out a pigeon for dating
but that bird didn 't return
what are you doing ?
you killed my jackie chan and donnie yen !
i see you like that don 't you ?
well this is for you too
you killed my chow yun fat i wanna kill you !
don 't mess up !
don 't lose your mind !
what do you want ?
i want to kill you !
what 's up with you ?
he killed all my honey
i don 't believe that you dare to move !
i UNknown l avenge again when i 'm back
don 't call me general
so what should i greet you ?
we just want to search for the princess
so why should we illegally UNknown here ?
if she hasn 't returned yet
we would be caught because we failed to protect the princess and caused her disappearance !
if this further causes the war between the 2 countries it would be shit !
but it 's still shit for we have no clue at all to search for the princess
let 's sneak in first just wait and see
this is no good let 's run
this is good let 's go in and get some information
this is a messy place
shouldn 't we go to the government office to get info from the cops ?
you 'r e ignorant !
people won 't tell lies after drinking
so the information we get here will be absolutely UNknown
handsome guy try our new wine please

you send your daughter here to pretend as the princess and then send a non blood daughter to disguise as the prince
you hold some hair late at the night !
and you claim that you 'r e not UNknown as yourself !
do you want to UNknown my kingdom ?
your conspiracy is disclosed at last !
okay let me go home to get changed after a bath and massage
i UNknown l then give you UNknown a trial
how dare you want to UNknown my kingdom !
it 's not harsh enough to beat you 50 times
i want her to get married but she jumped to the sea
i want her to substitute her and live a happy life but we met her and messed up my plan
at last you took her to the competition
i hit you 50 times !
men come here give him 500 000 tales
how do you explain your first love ?
well this is just a misunderstanding
UNknown jin loves this girl so i stopped him to sell his girl
UNknown jin would sacrifice his life for the girl
i failed because of love
love who can say it 's right or wrong ?
it 's not the right time to sing now
let 's finish the trial first
you 'r e right i agree with you
you UNknown e got a lover
why do you want to marry the princess ?
i did everything for nightingale
nightingale is the princess so i want to kidnap her
if she is the queen then i UNknown l kidnap the queen
but you don 't have to do it now better be quick
do you know it 's a crime to pretend as the princess ?
UNknown jin and i are in love
i lost my mind and wanted to commit suicide
but he saved my life
then you grabbed me here and forced me to be the princess
why didn 't you deny ?
i did but you just didn 't trust me
since the empress dowager is missing badly the princess
so i am forced to pretend
you are filial to a granny whom you don 't know at all
you can tell it is a conspiracy !
from this angle you 'r e guilty !
bang what would you like to say ?
your majesty my name is bing
i am the general in central china
pearl and i have fallen in love for ages
but you are alive here !
how did you meet your waterloo ?
i am sure you 'r e lying !
your majesty as what you have heard
i do think there is something wrong with me
however in order to meet pearl again
i must join the competition
but out of my expectation that
my first rival is pearl !
well isn 't it coincidence ?
do you think is she my sister ?
it 's true your majesty !
are you my sister ?
your majesty she lost her memory
no wonder she failed to recognize me !
she lost her memory !
don 't tell me this old trick !
we are just wasting time to get nothing here
i just want someone to be the scapegoat now
but i love my citizens most
tow this general out for execution
but i have just figured out something
i am not the most suspicious guy
why do you want to kill me ?
you failed to protect the princess
and you illegal UNknown into my kingdom
and you intended to rape the girl who lost memory !
also you disturbed me from sleeping
don 't forget me !
explain to your brother now !
don 't you take me as your sister ?
how dare you kill my boyfriend ?
are you insane or have you just lost memory ?
do you think you are my sister ?
in central china who mailed you the secret scroll for the stance of quick steps ?
how dare you claim me of a fake ?
everyone knows i am crazy for kung fu
it can 't prove that you 'r e my sister
you guys look sneaky !
i won 't be cheated by you guys !
tow him out for execution !
i order you to stop !
of course i know my daughter !
this flower was tattooed when pearl left home
i have found my sister
now a family re union makes everyone happy !
get this general out for execution now
then let 's call it a day !
he failed to finish his mission
and he caused this mess !
empress dowager has just got well
it 's not suitable to let her view such violent scene
for the sake of her health
let 's celebrate all together
i UNknown l forgive all of you
i allow you to marry the general from central china
i allow you to marry this violent scholar okay ?
i have to marry this guy with you
why do you do him this favour ?
actually i have been in love with someone else
if you want to match for me why not match him for me ?
who is that guy ?
he is a cultured guy
red tea green tea UNknown tea
i always want to see you dear
UNknown water melon and melon
i miss you miss you miss you

supposedly UNknown knows it but everyone has been there already
they just don 't remember
i am sure i haven 't been there so far
it 's a north cap island
the people have no idea how beautiful UNknown can be
because they always want to go to this one rock
i have been a couple of times there but each time on another rock foundation
last time two years ago i came with the post boat
yes i participate in a competition
it 's the gem of the lake UNknown finland
i spent a couple of UNknown there
the most unbelievable lake o UNknown world

UNknown done nothing wrong ever in my life
in any case we will take you back to hamburg
that is impossible i have to go to UNknown
well i guess that is not going to happen anymore
you should be more picky with your UNknown
have you really been so often in UNknown ?
is it really so UNknown there ? yes and i always take the plane
and while you mess UNknown criminals in the train i sit already on th UNknown and fish
on the other hand on UNknown rom you can find all european connections even the smallest side tracks are registered
well well mr UNknown der
and now tell me please the fastest connection to UNknown
you have to understand the system
the UNknown on UNknown are especially easy UNknown for non experts
and not always is the shortest connection the fastest
that depends absolutely on the train connection
do you understand if you go for example from stockholm through northern sweden then
yes in the UNknown train from hamburg to stockholm
but before they could UNknown him back to hamburg he escaped
do you think he has business with money UNknown ?
i invite you for dinner
you will see how the forest sparks in all colors
and then the snow comes and the sun goes lower and lower
and you grow more and more silent
and then comes the time without switch
you mean when it 's light all day and night ?
UNknown dark isn 't that terrible ?
that is hard for the soul
is that in UNknown too ?
UNknown UNknown is the end of the world
thats where you wanted to go on the shortest way
i want to be there in two days
do you have an appointment ?
well yes i participate in a competition
what do you intend to win there ?
the first price for the best timetable expert
and when are you the best ?
what is there strange ?
that the fuzz is about the fastest connections which else ?
i always pick the best connections
but the fastest is the best
which train do you UNknown UNknown morning ?
8 UNknown to UNknown UNknown 10 UNknown changing UNknown UNknown further direction UNknown UNknown
and then you arrive in UNknown in the late evening
do you like it to arrive at night in a strange place ?
the most beautiful way to UNknown leads through northern sweden through UNknown
but there you must stay overnight !
no of i travel i want to travel fast and arrive quick
are you that busy ?
UNknown i don 't need to be fast but i want to be fast
but i like to be travelling

no with the ice i gain time but what do i feel of the area i travel through ?
no houses no people no UNknown
yes but i don 't want to loose time

if i arrive faster i have more of it
and if i am the fastest i will win the competition
but what do you win really ?
you see time is money
about what do you dream ? dream ?
well first to win the competition
maybe you can make a job out of it
railway expert railway expert in the UNknown
you want to save all europeans time ?
yes exactly that 's the point to save time
a commission in UNknown developed a european high speed track
ice UNknown UNknown from london to naples from athens to stockholm from UNknown til UNknown
but the system isn 't good one could improve it a lot
i could come up with a much better concept
i got an absolutely new idea !
what do you dream about ?
about a rose farm in UNknown UNknown
and why exactly roses ?
i loved roses already as a child
my grandma cared always so much about her roses
already then i had the dream to grow roses when i am grown up
and now i want that we take over the farm of my grand parents
should we have breakfast together tomorrow ?
in the cafeteria about 7 UNknown ?
the assistant took a room on UNknown
but she didn 't book it in advance
oh here we have it
he is taking the ship
could you UNknown explain me what you are doing there ?
harry now it 's obvious the train UNknown UNknown to finland is shit
you have to stay in UNknown over night
hannes wouldn 't to that
stefan i don 't quite understand
harry hannes knows the fastest connections
the fastest connection to northern finland is to take the ship in stockholm
that 's why he takes the ship
and at the UNknown border tomorrow morning i UNknown l have him arrested
i forgot to reset the time
hey would you like to accompany me ?
come on do you know what ?
i UNknown l invite you yes you shall be my guest from now on
stefan the post UNknown report says UNknown fall two times
harry er ist even faster than we
stefan i am trying to UNknown what UNknown and you
i don 't need to be faster than he but better
i UNknown l do it completely different from now on
arrange for me the next flight to UNknown
stefan we are in the murder department
and the train ticket from UNknown to northern finland
i UNknown bet 13 UNknown 6 UNknown
the mistake will probably be solved soon i would ask the conductor
i UNknown in seven weeks
go your way go to your destiny
still is it long way from smiling to tenderness
i was told this is the most beautiful place in the world
do you know the holy island UNknown ?
my grandma did tell about it when i was a child
if a young UNknown boy wanted to marry he had before to spend seven days on the island alone
he was not allowed to take any food along
he should proof that he could feed a family
and the woman didn 't need to proof anything ?
on the seventh day the woman had to get to the island unnoticed by the man
and the man had to find her on the island
for their first kiss the had to stand on the highest top of the mountain
on the very top all alone
is the story true ?
i think i like your grandma
can we see the mountain from here ?
you have to far out on the lake
may i invite you to have a tee first ?
when the competition is over i 'i buy you a greenhouse in UNknown UNknown
criminal investigation department UNknown i arrest you
your boss in UNknown is dead
please i have to arrest you
but i hit him only
i have to take you to UNknown
it can 't be that he is a murderer
i have to participate there !
well whatever weber will be happy
what she didn 't confess ?
what do you mean she only tipped it off ?
manslaughter or murder will be judged in court
listen when i come to the office tomorrow
i want a full confession if the assistant on my desk and the case is closed
no i have still some business here
the most beautiful way to UNknown leads through northern sweden through UNknown
i UNknown l come and visit you
can i get my UNknown back ?
the best will be if you forget me
and don 't be sad because of UNknown
bang you 'r e dead !
it hasn 't rained in ages
maybe famine is UNknown in this summer heat
even yesterday 's bright sky made us feel our UNknown
no laurent not the mercedes
i want to be alone
it 's new york ; mr UNknown
what do i say ?
if you come back tomorrow you UNknown l be tired
he loves you ; comes in handy
who puts any value on a well executed death ?
even the rich who can afford it no longer bother
the wish to keep your death to yourself is UNknown and UNknown
are you in pain ?
how wonderful to be able to give what you don 't have
same old story ; again they offer us the future
never mind the answer is UNknown
who i ask you who
once the masses were happy without knowing why
now happiness is UNknown daily and they 'r e miserable
indifference distrust pride of power desire for revenge without punishment ; indeed often with prospect of reward
the secretary of state for scientific research
UNknown show him your project
abstract love doesn 't exist
as a young attach to the us embassy in rome
i knew a UNknown favrini
he was friendly with the ambassador
joseph UNknown what a man
he didn 't make scenes like others just did his job
so UNknown favrini industries is you
that 's the mystery of it
we 'r e the only ones
we must plant the idea of debt
our friends in budget will love that
sorry i forget the name
so you don 't put your trust in me but in love
it goes away if we 'r e not good enough
we can 't withdraw from others lives and yet remain ourselves
i 'm not holding you
mr secretary we 'r e at the heart of the matter
it 's not the UNknown idea of two damned souls alone and in revolt against the world and god and the UNknown which UNknown man
yet man is born into misery and adversity
why is he not accustomed to deceit a bit more UNknown against mishap ?
it 's prosperity he can 't handle as if he 'd had his fill of it
what UNknown l i do ?
it 's all right there
elena wants to be conquered in her own eyes
she recognized long ago that her nature was destructive
but no one has ever conquered her
no man was ever equal to it ; least of all me
and another thing sex is only an accessory
sorry i lent it to the UNknown girl
what 's must have ?
what 's it mean ?
for you miss muller ?
that UNknown music gets on my nerves
what UNknown l i do ?
it 's not mine cecile
women 's UNknown bent for nest building
this confidence in an amorous destiny
this serene confidence in an amorous destiny
nothing to do with economy or industry something much more remote
this calm UNknown faith in personal happiness as their rightful due making them UNknown themselves wings spread wide into unknown and empty space where no shore is visible
i don 't believe in sin
the thing is to arouse them without looking like a UNknown
we learn something from imbeciles gone astray in high drama
you can 't kiss a man who needs a shave
why kiss my hand ?
i 'm just a son of a bitch
my love my love it matters not that i am born
you become visible at the place where i am no more
i UNknown l work for you the whole day
before we met we were already unfaithful
the presence you chose grants no farewells
do you really exist ?
how about critics miss parker ?
a critic is a soldier who fires on his own regiment
or deserts to the enemy
UNknown to observe reflect write and we UNknown e let them slip
like eating a sandwich during a show or an apple
you 'r e a major stockholder in UNknown favrini
how about the warner 's UNknown ?
with 3 percent you can think but not tell
it wasn 't in the papers
elena or raoul made it up
and if i did screw it ; it 's all backwards
let people in books make things up
the UNknown UNknown UNknown male and female
society 's aware of it
that 's why above all it UNknown love
it 's a key to UNknown
it 's you who 's UNknown
UNknown when will he learn grammar ?
why doesn 't she go with you dorothy ?
a berth on the nile
ideal for a racing pulse
egypt 's taken us for a ride for 4000 years
the contessa has the draft agreement ?
i UNknown l ask mr UNknown
we UNknown l send a UNknown tomorrow
now dorothy can trade in her jaguar
3 percent of 5 billion dollars a far cry from the queen of england
her blouse lightly shakes as if she was UNknown poison
amazing the crowd around you when you think you 'r e alone with your man
people you don 't suspect
knives on the right !
others he doesn 't suspect
bread on the left !
we 'r e poor !
UNknown will i give my heart
breeding ! to one man to hurt so much
i UNknown l be many women
why was UNknown obsessed by
i quote the torture of an innocent child by a brute ?
yes but why first of all always why
why always why ? and never knew it
my friends there are no friends
UNknown thing desire i must say if it lets me long for what can never be
there is within action a lofty UNknown towards words
he UNknown l eat tonight !
so far all we UNknown e done is talk
yes but let 's think it over anyway
you have an idea ?
nothing is more abstract than crime
see UNknown 's article ?
the first time i saw terry UNknown he was dead drunk in a rolls royce
for me a novel starts this way
the first time i saw terry UNknown
talk about the capitalist dynamic
only balzac is allowed to write badly
have him read denis de UNknown
women love love ; men love solitude
so why throw them together ?
to rob one another of solitude and love
you decide as you always do that i was your destiny
did you ever ask if i was a man ; where i came from and why ?
you 'r e irresponsible !
you don 't understand my silence
how could you understand that there are others ?
who think who suffer who live
it 's a taste for perfection when you change
yet it 's taking a woman as she is ; free
why ask someone to change ? allowed to be herself
if i change i 'm no longer who i was
and if i 'm not that
could it be our view of the past is false since we 'r e always told about UNknown of men but never whom they gathered around
could it be we say
women children boys unaware that these words no longer have a UNknown only an UNknown of UNknown ?
we rarely form our own conscience ; we let ourselves be had
and the very UNknown of these two verbs is obscene
what 's wrong mr UNknown face ?
friends what a pleasure to serve you
but what i do is by honest preference
i therefore deserve no credit and am UNknown distressed
how can i remedy that ?
they 'r e over there
she is UNknown praise be
but such audacity to be a lover near to a girl betrothed
no dorothy 's in egypt ; i got a UNknown
a woman can 't do much to ruin a man
he carries his tragedy within him
she can provoke him irritate him she can kill him
there were rich people too
why spend so much money for a picture of something so simple ?
i can 't tell you
it 'd be nice if for once you said something
this the one from sweden ?
the UNknown 's ready ?
were you ever stung by a dead bee ?
it 's much more than love
ever get stung by a dead bee ?
they don 't want to be workers yet they want all the advantages
memory is the only paradise we can 't be expelled from
that 's not always true
then memory is the only hell to which we 'r e condemned in all innocence
for the first time we have a chance to say things for the last time
that 's the second serious thing you UNknown e said to me in 8 months
she felt that her happiness
you should know if the dollar drops
don 't sneer ; it can be yours too
a woman whom you love UNknown you of other women and sometimes of love
the lake wasn 't there where it usually was
and when they UNknown it through the trees it wasn 't the same
one small word to tell us where we are ; where we 'r e going would be worth fortunes
where do you run to and what will you do ?
alas i waste away in impotent UNknown to return to the confusion from whence i strayed
how often will i die to go on living ?
do you know the crime or by whom you are betrayed ?
don 't wait for us ; we 'r e going across
we UNknown l stay with the de UNknown
what 'r e these images ?
ever get stung by a dead bee ?
come on you piss me off
i can 't swim !
let her hoist her own fat ass
cecile what are these images sometimes free sometimes confined this vast thought where shapes pass while colors shine ?
let the wail of the wind the sigh of the wave the gentle perfume of your sweet scented air all we hear see and breathe all ; everywhere
let it say they have loved
there is work until evening to redeem the sins of the night
but a few pale rays shine through the mist and at dusk a gray cloud is UNknown in fire
we plot within set e an UNknown structure by UNknown 2 UNknown
where 's the contessa ?
what 's going on ?
take the blue room counselor
i UNknown e had it
london new york geneva in one night
i hope the bathtub 's fixed
where 's the dollar at ?
you know something joe ?
she 's going too far
men create the mystery women find the key
i made it up darling
what UNknown l i do ?
mr roger 's come back to life
a man rang the bell ; the spitting image
says he 's his brother
mama accepts it ; i don 't
he talked to madame ?
what 's the dollar worth ?
UNknown ; not even that
i have the death certificate
okay but anything new ?
but what UNknown l i do ?
what could i do ?
i don 't know what to do
i UNknown l handle it
joe and i UNknown l handle our own 3 percent
we 'r e not staying
he can 't be worse than the other clown
every clown has a UNknown
being and time are very different
light UNknown eternally when it has UNknown being and time
but how many lead only half a life
lacking guts to lead a whole one which see as double ?
we hear you 'd like to head one of our UNknown
how do you conceive the role of a UNknown ?
how d UNknown ou avoid a crash ?
up to now we UNknown e UNknown it off
but it 's getting harder to cope with UNknown running out of control
central banks are puppets ; raising lending rates is just stage UNknown
in the past such UNknown UNknown of credit and debt always led to major problems
there must be some long ago disaster to serve as a model today
go back to the collapse of the ancient world
what we call peace looks very like war
it 's hard to distinguish between and out and out theft ; and to determine
when a loose woman becomes a liberated one
since you know so much tell me my name
yes her name only that
i UNknown l be back to lovely UNknown
memory is the only paradise
only when memories become blood look gesture when they UNknown e no more name are inseparable from us only then can it happen in a rare moment in their midst
aren 't you going to finish ?
i UNknown l say something and you create an image
they haven 't the foggiest idea how far they got
what 'r e our engineers working on ?
they think they UNknown e found a UNknown particle which will multiply by 10 000 the speed of UNknown
when will the dollar rise ?
when europeans send up a prayer to america
when they go on their knees to ask for charity
it always needs touching up
its pattern its colors as if it suggests its own UNknown
but if you neglect it
the web of UNknown interests
can UNknown rival japan when germans make UNknown ?
let the world be without name for a moment
let things listen to themselves
in silence in their own time and their own way
and everyday life what 's that ?
the average of all our crimes
by pursuing UNknown you become UNknown and thus shake free from your daily UNknown
we UNknown l try you out
when middle east air is flying again go to UNknown
della UNknown l set it up
how far it is to work
how far it is to the angels
dorothy has friends in UNknown
we UNknown l give you addresses
2 months ago in cannes
i played tennis with a UNknown army colonel
whenever it was my serve he 'd yell
bomb it mr UNknown bomb it !
tell this one you UNknown l love him
among our vows of love was a promise never to force
a UNknown lie can be a splendid thing
boss when will you call me by my name ?
mr robert dirty dozen aldrich you know that we can 't UNknown your name your salary
we may do more we may do less than our duty and that UNknown its accomplishment
that 's the problem we always face
our stores our hotels the bank
UNknown is stalingrad ; your loans are in rubble
bank of suez chase manhattan
i hope nothing 's happened
i order you to talk mr UNknown
not so rich but it UNknown l come
della dear i was worried
the disasters of war for
the UNknown agreed to the deal ?
not negligible this act of faith out of interest by UNknown unto UNknown
our economy alias charity and by way of this alias breaks down barriers of politics and superstition
a commentary on isaiah ; ask miss parker
weird to find the in a UNknown cellar
islam isn 't built on doubt like our civilization but on certainty
UNknown the nude without the UNknown
very UNknown ; i 'd forgotten the UNknown breasts
rather a hussy seems to me
call it hush hush and forget it
she 's looking at someone
the man who 's made it in society succeeded in the market been accepted abroad comes a UNknown over a woman
she UNknown a real person
the man realizes that others had asked very little of him !
not to worry ; UNknown will pay you more than UNknown
i allow you a glass of UNknown
you know in arabic UNknown is shark
the man realizes that the woman asked very little of him
there are no friends !
we UNknown e increased our efforts in the us
aristotle right ? as is our custom
we go into a country to create a market not exploit it
you 'r e through at UNknown favrini !
8 30 sharp ; in the office !
why do you stay ?
in madame 's service ?
i 'm not like you mr UNknown
the positive is given to us
it remains for us to make the negative
madame doesn 't need me ?
there 's no judge ; anywhere
what isn 't resolved by love stays forever in suspense
whatever i say within me are only words which will UNknown me
all this grass ; is it within me ?
is it grass when it 's without me ?
if no one labels it ; gives it a name what then is grass ?
i 'm here to see mr UNknown
i UNknown l look around
summer was early this year and a bit deranged
it isn 't time nor UNknown that most threaten love but a sense of security a state of distraction
we forget how UNknown it is barely UNknown it ; as with a summer bound to come again we let slip many fine days
if i feel like it
i UNknown l train UNknown m right
is there anything you can 't do ?
love 's made me blind
i UNknown l be outside
i don 't see you
if not for your face
i wouldn 't be forced to love you
even were you not another you still would be
we UNknown l kill all that for good
from the moment i saw you
because i run things ?
by delivering me from my life you stole it
the presence you chose delivers no goodbyes
you came from outside and through love installed yourself in me and
i 'm a trap for you
the more faithful i am
the more i UNknown l deceive you
you mustn 't worry about me
you can keep one of the mercedes
giving a hand is all i wanted of joy
so it was you ?
it 's you it 's me
were you ever stung by a dead bee ?
it died in a rage !
mr richard is mr roger ?
only madame knew the answer
it 's not the same one
bang you 'r e dead !
it hasn 't rained in ages
maybe famine is UNknown in this summer heat
even yesterday 's bright sky made us feel our UNknown
no laurent not the mercedes
i want to be alone
it 's new york ; mr UNknown
what do i say ?
if you come back tomorrow you UNknown l be tired
he loves you ; comes in handy
who puts any value on a well executed death ?
even the rich who can afford it no longer bother
the wish to keep your death to yourself is UNknown and UNknown
are you in pain ?
how wonderful to be able to give what you don 't have
same old story ; again they offer us the future
never mind the answer is UNknown
who i ask you who
once the masses were happy without knowing why
now happiness is UNknown daily and they 'r e miserable
indifference distrust pride of power desire for revenge without punishment ; indeed often with prospect of reward
the secretary of state for scientific research
UNknown show him your project
abstract love doesn 't exist
as a young attach to the us embassy in rome
i knew a UNknown favrini
he was friendly with the ambassador
joseph UNknown what a man
he didn 't make scenes like others just did his job
so UNknown favrini industries is you
that 's the mystery of it
we 'r e the only ones
we must plant the idea of debt
our friends in budget will love that
sorry i forget the name
so you don 't put your trust in me but in love
it goes away if we 'r e not good enough
we can 't withdraw from others lives and yet remain ourselves
i 'm not holding you
mr secretary we 'r e at the heart of the matter
it 's not the UNknown idea of two damned souls alone and in revolt against the world and god and the UNknown which UNknown man
yet man is born into misery and adversity
why is he not accustomed to deceit a bit more UNknown against mishap ?
it 's prosperity he can 't handle as if he 'd had his fill of it
what UNknown l i do ?
it 's all right there
elena wants to be conquered in her own eyes
she recognized long ago that her nature was destructive
but no one has ever conquered her
no man was ever equal to it ; least of all me
and another thing sex is only an accessory
sorry i lent it to the UNknown girl
what 's must have ?
what 's it mean ?
for you miss muller ?
that UNknown music gets on my nerves
what UNknown l i do ?
it 's not mine cecile
women 's UNknown bent for nest building
this confidence in an amorous destiny
this serene confidence in an amorous destiny
nothing to do with economy or industry something much more remote
this calm UNknown faith in personal happiness as their rightful due making them UNknown themselves wings spread wide into unknown and empty space where no shore is visible
i don 't believe in sin
the thing is to arouse them without looking like a UNknown
we learn something from imbeciles gone astray in high drama
you can 't kiss a man who needs a shave
why kiss my hand ?
i 'm just a son of a bitch
my love my love it matters not that i am born
you become visible at the place where i am no more
i UNknown l work for you the whole day
before we met we were already unfaithful
the presence you chose grants no farewells
do you really exist ?
how about critics miss parker ?
a critic is a soldier who fires on his own regiment
or deserts to the enemy
UNknown to observe reflect write and we UNknown e let them slip
like eating a sandwich during a show or an apple
you 'r e a major stockholder in UNknown favrini
how about the warner 's UNknown ?
with 3 percent you can think but not tell
it wasn 't in the papers
elena or raoul made it up
and if i did screw it ; it 's all backwards
let people in books make things up
the UNknown UNknown UNknown male and female
society 's aware of it
that 's why above all it UNknown love
it 's a key to UNknown
it 's you who 's UNknown
UNknown when will he learn grammar ?
why doesn 't she go with you dorothy ?
a berth on the nile
ideal for a racing pulse
egypt 's taken us for a ride for 4000 years
the contessa has the draft agreement ?
i UNknown l ask mr UNknown
we UNknown l send a UNknown tomorrow
now dorothy can trade in her jaguar
3 percent of 5 billion dollars a far cry from the queen of england
her blouse lightly shakes as if she was UNknown poison
amazing the crowd around you when you think you 'r e alone with your man
people you don 't suspect
knives on the right !
others he doesn 't suspect
bread on the left !
we 'r e poor !
UNknown will i give my heart
breeding ! to one man to hurt so much
i UNknown l be many women
why was UNknown obsessed by
i quote the torture of an innocent child by a brute ?
yes but why first of all always why
why always why ? and never knew it
my friends there are no friends
UNknown thing desire i must say if it lets me long for what can never be
there is within action a lofty UNknown towards words
he UNknown l eat tonight !
so far all we UNknown e done is talk
yes but let 's think it over anyway
you have an idea ?
nothing is more abstract than crime
see UNknown 's article ?
the first time i saw terry UNknown he was dead drunk in a rolls royce
for me a novel starts this way
the first time i saw terry UNknown
talk about the capitalist dynamic
only balzac is allowed to write badly
have him read denis de UNknown
women love love ; men love solitude
so why throw them together ?
to rob one another of solitude and love
you decide as you always do that i was your destiny
did you ever ask if i was a man ; where i came from and why ?
you 'r e irresponsible !
you don 't understand my silence
how could you understand that there are others ?
who think who suffer who live
it 's a taste for perfection when you change
yet it 's taking a woman as she is ; free
why ask someone to change ? allowed to be herself
if i change i 'm no longer who i was
and if i 'm not that
could it be our view of the past is false since we 'r e always told about UNknown of men but never whom they gathered around
could it be we say
women children boys unaware that these words no longer have a UNknown only an UNknown of UNknown ?
we rarely form our own conscience ; we let ourselves be had
and the very UNknown of these two verbs is obscene
what 's wrong mr UNknown face ?
friends what a pleasure to serve you
but what i do is by honest preference
i therefore deserve no credit and am UNknown distressed
how can i remedy that ?
they 'r e over there
she is UNknown praise be
but such audacity to be a lover near to a girl betrothed
no dorothy 's in egypt ; i got a UNknown
a woman can 't do much to ruin a man
he carries his tragedy within him
she can provoke him irritate him she can kill him
there were rich people too
why spend so much money for a picture of something so simple ?
i can 't tell you
it 'd be nice if for once you said something
this the one from sweden ?
the UNknown 's ready ?
were you ever stung by a dead bee ?
it 's much more than love
ever get stung by a dead bee ?
they don 't want to be workers yet they want all the advantages
memory is the only paradise we can 't be expelled from
that 's not always true
then memory is the only hell to which we 'r e condemned in all innocence
for the first time we have a chance to say things for the last time
that 's the second serious thing you UNknown e said to me in 8 months
she felt that her happiness
you should know if the dollar drops
don 't sneer ; it can be yours too
a woman whom you love UNknown you of other women and sometimes of love
the lake wasn 't there where it usually was
and when they UNknown it through the trees it wasn 't the same
one small word to tell us where we are ; where we 'r e going would be worth fortunes
where do you run to and what will you do ?
alas i waste away in impotent UNknown to return to the confusion from whence i strayed
how often will i die to go on living ?
do you know the crime or by whom you are betrayed ?
don 't wait for us ; we 'r e going across
we UNknown l stay with the de UNknown
what 'r e these images ?
ever get stung by a dead bee ?
come on you piss me off
i can 't swim !
let her hoist her own fat ass
cecile what are these images sometimes free sometimes confined this vast thought where shapes pass while colors shine ?
let the wail of the wind the sigh of the wave the gentle perfume of your sweet scented air all we hear see and breathe all ; everywhere
let it say they have loved
there is work until evening to redeem the sins of the night
but a few pale rays shine through the mist and at dusk a gray cloud is UNknown in fire
we plot within set e an UNknown structure by UNknown 2 UNknown
where 's the contessa ?
what 's going on ?
take the blue room counselor
i UNknown e had it
london new york geneva in one night
i hope the bathtub 's fixed
where 's the dollar at ?
you know something joe ?
she 's going too far
men create the mystery women find the key
i made it up darling
what UNknown l i do ?
mr roger 's come back to life
a man rang the bell ; the spitting image
says he 's his brother
mama accepts it ; i don 't
he talked to madame ?
what 's the dollar worth ?
UNknown ; not even that
i have the death certificate
okay but anything new ?
but what UNknown l i do ?
what could i do ?
i don 't know what to do
i UNknown l handle it
joe and i UNknown l handle our own 3 percent
we 'r e not staying
he can 't be worse than the other clown
every clown has a UNknown
being and time are very different
light UNknown eternally when it has UNknown being and time
but how many lead only half a life
lacking guts to lead a whole one which see as double ?
we hear you 'd like to head one of our UNknown
how do you conceive the role of a UNknown ?
how d UNknown ou avoid a crash ?
up to now we UNknown e UNknown it off
but it 's getting harder to cope with UNknown running out of control
central banks are puppets ; raising lending rates is just stage UNknown
in the past such UNknown UNknown of credit and debt always led to major problems
there must be some long ago disaster to serve as a model today
go back to the collapse of the ancient world
what we call peace looks very like war
it 's hard to distinguish between and out and out theft ; and to determine
when a loose woman becomes a liberated one
since you know so much tell me my name
yes her name only that
i UNknown l be back to lovely UNknown
memory is the only paradise
only when memories become blood look gesture when they UNknown e no more name are inseparable from us only then can it happen in a rare moment in their midst
aren 't you going to finish ?
i UNknown l say something and you create an image
they haven 't the foggiest idea how far they got
what 'r e our engineers working on ?
they think they UNknown e found a UNknown particle which will multiply by 10 000 the speed of UNknown
when will the dollar rise ?
when europeans send up a prayer to america
when they go on their knees to ask for charity
it always needs touching up
its pattern its colors as if it suggests its own UNknown
but if you neglect it
the web of UNknown interests
can UNknown rival japan when germans make UNknown ?
let the world be without name for a moment
let things listen to themselves
in silence in their own time and their own way
and everyday life what 's that ?
the average of all our crimes
by pursuing UNknown you become UNknown and thus shake free from your daily UNknown

della UNknown l set it up
how far it is to work

mr richard is mr roger ?
only madame knew the answer
it 's not the same one
we have a man on the shore !
i 'm on my way
are you here to kill me ?
i know what this is
i UNknown e seen one before
it belonged to a man i met in a half remembered dream
a man possessed of some radical notions
once an idea has taken hold of the brain it 's almost impossible to UNknown
an idea that is fully formed fully understood that sticks
in the dream state your conscious defense is lowered and it makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft
sir saito we can train your subconscious to defend itself from even
how can i do that ?
cause i am the most skilled UNknown
i know how to search your mind and find your secrets
and i can teach them to you so even when you 'r e asleep your defense is never down
look if you want my help you 'r e gonna have to be completely open with me
i need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife better than your UNknown better than anyone
if this is a dream and you have a safe full of secrets
i need to know what 's in that safe
in order for this all to work you need to completely let me in
he 's playing with us
the information is in the safe
he looked right at it when i mentioned secrets
what 's she doing here ?
just head back to the room alright
i UNknown l take care of this
okay make sure you do
we 'r e here to work
if i jump would i survive ?
mal what are you doing here ?
i thought you might be missing me
you know that i am
but i can 't trust you anymore
looks like arthur 's taste
actually the subject is partial disposal of british painters
did the two kids miss me ?
what are you doing ?
now the envelope mr cobb
did she tell you ?
have you known all along ?
that you 'r e here to steal from me or that we are actually asleep ?
i want to know the name of your employer
there 's no use in threatening within a dream right mal ?
that depends on what you 'r e threatening
pain is in the mind and judging by the UNknown we 'r e in your mind right arthur ?
what are you doing ?
but the dream has collapsed
just try to keep saito lie a little bit longer
i think that 's gonna work
you came prepared hmm ?
not even my head of security knows this apartment
how did you find it ?
it 's very difficult for a man of your position to keep a love nest like this secret particularly when there 's a married woman involved
they 'r e getting closer
you got what you need
well it 's not true
you left out a key piece of information didn 't you ?
you held something back because you knew what we were up to
an audition for what ?
we UNknown every bit of information you had in there
but your dream approach is obvious
you don 't seem to understand mr saito
the operation that hired us they won 't accept failure
looks like i 'm gonna have to do this a little more simply
tell us what you know !
tell us what you know now !
i UNknown e always hated this carpet
it stain and fade in such UNknown ways
that way you know it 's made of wool
but now a line of UNknown
which means i 'm not lying on my carpet in my apartment
you have lived after your reputation mr cobb
where did he go ?
we 'r e not getting paid
dream within a dream huh
but in my dream you play by my rules
yes but you see mr saito
we 'r e not in your dream
how did you mess up the carpet ?
it wasn 't my fault
you 'r e the architect
i don 't know he 's gonna rub his damn cheek on it !
you what the hell is all that ?
i have it under control
i didn 't see it under control
we don 't have time for this
we still have to check every compartment
who 's just okay ?
is that you james ?
yeah when are you coming home dad ?
well i can 't sweetheart
i told you i 'm away because i 'm working right ?
grandma says you 'r e never coming back
UNknown is that you ?
put grandma on the phone for me will you ?
she 's shaking her head
james we UNknown e talked about this
listen i wanna send some presents with grandpa alright ?
and you be good you be
locked down in a dream mal showing up
sorry about your leg it won 't happen again
it 's getting worse isn 't it ?
one apology is all you 'r e getting huh arthur
no we 'r e supposed to go over saito 's expansion plans in UNknown engineering two hours ago
by now they know we failed
it 's time we disappear
fell off the company and bargained for his life
so i offer you the satisfaction
it 's not the way i deal with things
but i can 't speak for UNknown engineering
if you can steal an idea from someone 's mind why can 't you plant one idea instead
okay here 's me planting an idea in your head
don 't think about elephants
but it 's not your idea because you know i gave it to you
the subject 's mind can always trace the UNknown of the idea
true inspiration 's impossible to fake
can you do it ?
are you offering me a choice ?
cause i can find my own way to square things with UNknown
you don 't need to have a choice
and i choose to leave sir
tell the crew where you want to go
how would you like to go home ?
can 't fix that !
no idea is simple when you need to plant it in somebody else 's mind
my main competitor is an old man in poor health
his son will soon inherit control of the corporation
i need him to decide to break up his father 's empire
if i were to do this if i even could do it i need a guarantee
how do i know you can deliver ?
so do you want to take a leap of faith ?
or become an old man filled with regrets waiting to die alone ?
assemble your team mr cobb
and choose your people more wisely
look i know how much you wanna go home
but this can 't be done
you just have to go deep enough
you don 't know that
i UNknown e done it before
who 'd you do it to ?
are we going to paris ?
we 'r e gonna need a new architect
you never did like your office did you ?
no space to think in that room covered
is it safe for you to be here ?
UNknown between france and the united states is a UNknown nightmare you know that
i think they might find a way to make it work in your case
look i brought this for you to give to the kids when you have a chance
it will take more than the occasional stuffed animal to convince those children they still have a father
i 'm just doing what i know
i 'm doing what you taught me
i never taught you to be a thief
no you taught me to navigate people 's minds but after what happened
they wanna hold our legitimate ways for me to use that skill
what are you doing here UNknown ?
i think i found a way home
it 's a job for some very very powerful people
people who i believe can fix my charges permanently
but i need your help
you 'r e here to corrupt one of my brightest and best
you know what i 'm offering
it 's the chance to build UNknown entire cities things that never existed
things that couldn 't exist in the real world
so you want me to let someone else follow you into your fantasy
they don 't actually come in to the dream
they just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers
mal won 't let me
those kids your grandchildren they 'r e waiting for their father to come back home
and this job this last job that 's how i get there
i would not be standing here if i knew any other way
i need an architect who 's as good as i was
i 'd like you to meet mr cobb
if you have a few moments
mr cobb has a job offer he 'd like to discuss with you
i have a test for you
you 'r e not gonna tell me anything about this first ?
it 's not strictly speaking legal
you have to do better than that
that 's more like it
they say we only use a fraction of our brain 's true potential
now that 's when we 'r e awake
when we 'r e asleep the mind can do almost anything
well imagine you 'r e designing a building right ?
you consciously create each aspect
but sometimes it feels like it 's almost creating itself
now in a dream our mind continuously does this
we create and perceive our world simultaneously
and our mind does this so well that we don 't even know it 's happening
by taking over the creating part
now this is where i need you
you create the world of the dream
we bring the subject into that dream
and they feel it 's their subconscious
how can i ever acquire enough detail to make them think that it 's reality
well dreams they feel real while we 'r e in them right ?
it 's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange
let me ask you a question
you never really remember the beginning of a dream do you ?
you always wind up right in the middle of what 's going on
so how did we end up here ?
well we just came from the
how did you get here ?
where are you right now ?
we 'r e dreaming ?
you 'r e actually in the middle of the workshop right now sleeping
and this is your first lesson in shared dreaming so there you go
if it 's just a dream then why are you
it 's never just a dream is it ?
when your face is full of glass feels like hell
when you 'r e in it it feels real
it 's what the military developed
during that time it was a training program for soldiers to shoot and stab and strangle each other and then wake up ?
how did UNknown think they belong ?
well someone had to design the dreams right ?
why don 't you give us another five minutes ?
we were talking for like at least an hour
in a dream your mind functions more quickly therefore time seems to feel more slow
five minutes in the world gives you an hour in the dream
why don 't we see what you can get up to in five minutes ?
almost everything else is here to
who are the people ?
remember you are the dreamer
i am the subject my mind UNknown it
you can literally talk to my subconscious
that 's one of the ways we extract information from a subject
how else do you do it ?
by creating something secure like a
like a bank vault or a jail
i guess i thought that the dream space should be all about the visual but it 's more about the feel of it
my question is what happens when you start messing with the physics of it all ?
something isn 't it ?
why are they all looking at me ?
cause my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world
it sense the foreign nature of the dreamer
they attack like white blood cells fighting an infection
mind telling your subconscious to take it easy ?
this place is real isn 't it ?
yeah i cross it everyday to get to the college
never recreate places from your memory
well you gotta draft from stuff you know right ?
a street lamp or a phone booth
because building a dream from your memory is the easiest way to lose your grasp from what 's real and what is a dream
is that what happened to you ?
this has nothing to do with me understand ?
is that why you need me to build your dreams ?
hey hey hey look at me
why why wouldn 't i wake up ?
cause there were still some time on the clock and you can 't wake up within a dream unless you die
a UNknown it 's a small personal
that 's some subconscious you got on you cobb !
she 's a real charmer
oh i see you met mrs cobb
you need a small object to UNknown have you something you have all the time that no one else knows
it must be more unique than that
this is a loaded die
i can 't let you touch it
that would defeat the purpose
only i know the balance and the weight of this particular loaded die
that way when you look at your UNknown
and i 'm not about to just open my mind to someone like that
she UNknown l be back
i UNknown e never seen anyone pick it up that quickly before
reality is not gonna be enough for her now
and when she comes back
if she comes back you 'r e gonna have her building UNknown
where are you gonna be ?
no he 's in UNknown
it 's UNknown 's backyard
it 's a necessary risk
there is plenty of good thieves
we don 't just need a thief
you can rub them together all you want but they 'r e not gonna breed
you UNknown l never know
how 's your handwriting ?
now before you bother telling me it 's impossible
no it 's perfectly possible
you still work with that stick and mind ?
he 's good at what he does right ?
oh he 's the best
listen if you 'r e gonna perform UNknown you need imagination
let me ask you something
have you done it before ?
we got the idea in place
but it didn 't take
you didn 't plant it deep enough ?
no it 's not just about depth
you need the simplest version of the idea in order for it to grow naturally in your subjects
mind is a very subtle art
so what is this idea that you need to plant ?
we need the heir of a major corporation to dissolve his father 's empire
well you see right there you have various political UNknown and UNknown UNknown sentiments to set forth
and with all that stuff it 's really at the mercy of your subject 's prejudice
and what you have to do is start with the absolute basic
the relationship with the father
do you have a chemist ?
he UNknown his own versions of the UNknown
when are you taking me there ?
once you lost your tail
that price on my head was that dead or alive ?
i UNknown l meet you downstairs in the bar in say in half an hour
you 'r e not dreaming now are you ?
care for a lift mr cobb ?
what are you doing in UNknown ?
i need to protect my investments
cobb said you 'd be back
i tried not to come but
but there 's nothing quite like it
it 's just pure creation
shall we take a look at some UNknown architecture ?
what kind of tricks ?
in a dream you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes
that lets you create closed UNknown
so a closed loop like that will help you disguise the boundaries of the dream you create
how big do these levels have to be ?
it could be anything from the floor of a building to an entire city
and the better the maze
then the longer we have
my subconscious seems quiet enough
you wait till it turns ugly
no one likes to feel someone else is messing around with their mind
cobb can 't build anymore can he ?
i don 't know if he can 't but he won 't
he won 't tell me
but i think it 's mal
they 'r e still together ?
what you 'r e seeing there is just his projection of her
what was she like in real life ?
to UNknown UNknown for a job ?
and to go into the field with us
no i rarely go into the field mr cobb
we 'd need you there to tell the UNknown specific to our needs
a dream within a dream ?
that many dreams within dreams is too unstable
it is possible you just had to have a sedative
the only way to know you UNknown e done the job is if i am with you
there 's no room for tourists on a job like this mr saito
this time it seems there is
this i think is a good place to start
yeah i UNknown l show you
they come everyday to share the dream
how long do they dream for ?
three four hours each day
and the dream time ?
about forty hours each and every day
why do they do it ?
after a while it becomes the only way you can dream
do you still dream mr cobb ?
they come to be woken up
the dream has become their reality
who are you to say otherwise huh ?
let 's see what you can do
you know how to find me
you know what you have to do
robert fischer heir to the fischer morrow energy UNknown
what 's your problem with this mr fischer ?
that 's not your concern
mr saito this isn 't your typical corporate espionage
you asked me for UNknown
i do hope you understand the gravity of that request
the seed that we plant in this man 's mind will grow into an idea
this idea will define him
it may come to change
it may come to change everything about him
we 'r e the last company standing between them and total energy UNknown
we can no longer compete
soon they UNknown l control the energy supply of half the world
in effect they become a new UNknown
the world needs robert fischer to change his mind
that 's where we come in
how is robert fischer 's relationship with his father ?
rumor is the relationship is quite complicated
but we can 't work based solely on rumor can 't we ?
can you get me access to this man here ?
browning fischer UNknown 's right hand man
if you can get the right references
references are something of a specialty for me mr saito
i 'm not smelling settlement here
mr browning maurice fischer 's policy is always one of avoiding UNknown
shall we voice your concerns with maurice directly ?
not sure if that 's necessary
i don 't wanna bother him unnecessarily but
robert did i tell you to keep out of town
no don 't speak mr fischer
must be a cherish memory of his
i put it beside his bed
he hasn 't even noticed
robert we need to talk about the power of attorney
i know this is hard right now
not now uncle peter but it 's imperative that we start to
the sicker maurice fischer becomes the more powerful peter browning becomes
i UNknown e had ample opportunity to observe browning adopt his physical presence study his UNknown and so on and so forth
now in the first layer of the dream i can UNknown browning
and suggest UNknown to fischer 's conscious mind
then when we take him a level deeper his own projection of browning should should UNknown right back to him
that 's the only way it will stick
he has to see himself generate it
your confession has always as much appreciated arthur thank you
i was just just running some experiments
yeah i was just i was working on my UNknown actually
here let me take a look
so you 'r e learning huh ?
an elegant solution for keeping track of reality
was it your idea ?
you spin it in a dream and it would never UNknown
arthur told me she past away
how are the UNknown coming on ?
each level UNknown to the part of the subject 's subconscious that we are trying to access
so making the bottom level hospitals
so fischer will bring his father
actually i have a question about this layout
don 't show me UNknown
only the dreamer should know the layout
why is that so important ?
in case one of us brings in our UNknown we don 't want them knowing the details of the maze
you mean in case you bring mal in
you can 't build because if you know the maze then she knows it
which should sabotage the whole operation
you gotta warn them if this is getting worse
no one said it 's getting worse
i need to get home
that 's all i care about right now
why can 't you go home ?
for not asking whether i did
i UNknown l split up my father 's empire
now this is obviously an idea that robert himself will choose to reject
that 's why we need to plant it deep in the subconscious
we need to find a way to translate this into an emotional concept
how do you translate a business strategy to an emotion ?
UNknown and robert two UNknown of UNknown two very UNknown types of management
that 's what we 'r e here to figure out right ?
now robert 's relationship with his father is UNknown to say the least
i can 't remember that
because suggesting him to break up his father 's company is a screw you to the old man
no cause i think positive emotion triumphs negative emotion everytime
we need robert fischer to have a positive emotional reaction to all this
my father accepts that i want to create for myself not follow in his footsteps
we 'r e gonna need to do a little better than might
thank you for your contribution arthur
UNknown is not about being specific
when we get inside his mind we 'r e gonna have to work at what we find
i will not follow in my father 's footsteps
and the next level down we feed him with
i will create something for myself
by the time we hit the bottom level we bring out the big guns
the compound that UNknown l be used to share the dream creates avery clear connection between dreamers plus actually UNknown brain function
in other words it gives us more time on each level
brain function in the dream will be about twenty times normal
when you enter a dream within that dream the effect is UNknown
it 's three dreams that 's 10 hours that 's twenty
i 'm sorry math is never my strong subject
how much time is that ?
it 's a week the first level down
six months the second level and the third level
who would wanna be stuck in a dream for ten years ?
so once we UNknown e made the plants how do we get out ?
what 's a kick ?
this UNknown would be a kick
it 's that feeling of falling you get the UNknown you awaken snaps you out of the dream
are we gonna feel a kick with this kind of UNknown ?
oh that 's the UNknown
i UNknown e UNknown it to leave any ear function UNknown
the trick is to synchronize a kick that can penetrate all three levels
we can use a musical content to synchronize the different kicks
he doesn 't have any surgery scheduled no dental nothing
nothing that will put him under for any UNknown
we need we need at least a good ten hours
one of the longest flights in the world
he makes it every two weeks
and he must be flying private
not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane
but that should be a UNknown
cause in a UNknown the pilot 's up top and the first class cabin is in the nose
so no one would walk through
but you 'd have to buy out the entire cabin
and the first class flight
terrific work by the way
you know how to find me
you know what you have to do
do you remember when you ask me to marry you ?
you said you had a dream
that will grow old together
you shouldn 't be here
i just want to see what kind of tests you 'r e doing here alone every night
whatever it was it has nothing to do with you
it has everything to do with me
why do you do this to yourself ?
it 's the only way i can still dream
why is it so important to dream ?
in my dreams we 'r e still together
these aren 't just dreams
these are memories and you said never to use memories
you 'r e trying to keep her alive
you can 't let her go
these are moments that i regret and memories that i have to change
oh what 's down there that you regret ?
listen i do know one thing that you need to understand about me
is this your house ?
mine and mal 's yes
that 's my son james
he 's digging for something maybe a worm
you see i thought about calling out to them so they 'd turn and smile and i can those those beautiful faces of theirs but it 's all too late
right now or never cobb
then i start to panic
i realized i don 't want to regret this moment that
but the moment 's passed
and whatever i do i can 't change this moment
so i 'm about to call out to them and run away
if i 'm ever gonna see their faces again i UNknown e gotta get back home
what are you doing here ?
i know who you are
what are you doing here ?
i 'm just trying to understand
how could you understand ?
do you know what it is to be a lover ?
i UNknown l tell you a riddle
you 'r e waiting for a train
a train that will take you far away
you know where you hope this train will take you
but you don 't know for sure
but it doesn 't matter
how can it not matter to you where the train will take you ?
cause we will be together
how could you bring her here UNknown ?
what is this place ?
this is the hotel suite where we should spend our anniversary
you promised we UNknown l be together !
please i need you stay here !
you said we UNknown l be together !
you said we UNknown l grow old together !
do you think you can just build a prison of memories to lock her in ?
do you really think that that 's gonna contain her ?
maurice fischer just died in sydney
when is the funeral ?
robert should accompany the body no later than tuesday
cobb i 'm coming with you
the team needs someone who understands what you 'r e struggling with
and it doesn 't have to be me
but then you have to show arthur what i just saw
get us another seat on the plane
if i get on this plane and you don 't honor our agreement
when we land i go to jail for the rest of my life
complete the job on board
i UNknown l make one phone call from the plane
you will have no trouble getting through immigration
oh yeah i 'm sorry my bad
excuse me i think this is yours ?
you must UNknown e dropped it
gentlemen can i have your drink ?
you know i couldn 't help but notice but you won 't happen to be related to
the maurice fischer would you ?
yes he he was my father
well he was a very inspiring figure
may he rest in peace huh
what are you doing ?
oh sorry i thought it was free
there 's 500 in there and the wallet 's worth more than that
so you might as well drop me at my stop
i 'm afraid that this
what was going on ?
get fischer in the back room now !
get him the back room !
has he been shot ?
what happened to you ?
the girl played a freight train
why did you put a train crossing in the middle of a downtown UNknown ?
where did it come from ?
let me ask you a question !
why the hell were you ambushed ?
those were not normal UNknown !
they UNknown e been trained for god 's sakes !
how can they be trained ?
fischer had an UNknown that teaches subconscious to defend itself
so his subconscious is UNknown
it should UNknown e shown in the research
don 't tell me to calm down
this was your job goddamn it !
this was your responsibility !
you were meant to check fischer 's background thoroughly !
we are not prepared for this type of violence !
we have dealt with self security before !
we UNknown l be a little more careful and we 'r e gonna be fine !
this was not a part of the plan !
he 's dying for god 's sake !
now let 's put him out of his misery
don 't do that !
what 's the matter cobb ?
don 't do that he 's in agony i 'm waking him up
no it won 't wake him up
what do you mean it won 't wake him up ?
it won 't wake him up
when we die in a dream we wake up
we 'r e too heavily UNknown to wake up that way
right so what happens when we die ?
we drop in a UNknown
what the hell is down there ?
except for whatever might have been left behind by anyone sharing the dream who has been trapped there before
which in our case is just you
how long can we be stuck there ?
i can 't even think about trying to escape until the UNknown is
decades it could be infinite
ask him he 's the one who 's been there
you got first aid ?
so you knew about this risk and you didn 't tell us ?
there weren 't meant to be any risk cause i didn 't know we 'd be dealing with a load of gunfire
you had no right it was the only way to go three layers deep
and you you knew about this and went along with it ?
it 's like he said he 'd done it before
he 'd done it before what with mal ?
cause that worked so good ?
it has nothing to do with it
i did what i had to do to get back to my children
so you lead us into a war zone with no way out
there is a way out
alright we continue on with the job and we do this as fast as possible and we get out using the kick
forget it if we go any deeper we UNknown l just raise the stakes
i am sitting this one out on this level boys
fischer 's security is surrounding this place as we speak
ten hours of flight time is a week at this level
that means each and every one of us will be killed
we have no other choice but to continue on and do it as fast as possible
you come on let 's go shake him up
i 'm insured against kidnapping for up to ten million
this should be very simple
in your father 's office below the UNknown is his personal safe
i don 't know any safe
it doesn 't mean you don 't know the combination
tell us what it is
who is this authority ? 500 this cost ?
we UNknown e got an hour
i was supposed to have all night to practice
saito wasn 't supposed to be shot in the chest
we got one hour now get use something useful please
i don 't know it
why does browning say you do ?
just let me talk to him and i UNknown l find out
those bastards bad at me for two days
they said i 'd know the combination
but i don 't know it
maurice told me that when he past you were the only to be able to open it
no he never gave me any combination
maybe he did i mean maybe you just didn 't know it was a combination
some meaningful combination of numbers based on your experiences with maurice
we didn 't have very many meaningful experiences together
perhaps after your mother died
after my mother died you know what he told me ?
robert there 's really nothing to be said
oh well he was bad with emotion
i was eleven uncle peter
how is he doing ?
he 's in a lot of pain
when we get down to the lower levels the pain will be less intense
and if he dies ?
when he wakes up his mind is completely gone
cobb i will still honor the arrangement
but when you wake up you won 't even remember that we had an arrangement
UNknown is gonna become your reality
you 'r e gonna be lost down there so long that you 'r e gonna become an old man
no i UNknown l come back
these people are gonna kill us if we don 't give them the combination
they just want a ransom
what is in the safe ?
maurice 's will is with port and dunn
this would UNknown the other if you wanted to
it splits off the UNknown business of fischer morrow
and it 'd be the end of the entire empire as we know it
why would he suggest that you think ?
i just don 't know
in his own way ?
at the end he called me into his deathbed
and he could barely speak
but he took the trouble to tell me one last thing
when were you in UNknown ?
the truth that at any minute you might bring a freight train through the wall
the truth that mal is bursting through your subconscious
and the truth that as we go deeper into fischer we 'r e also going deeper into you
and i i 'm not sure we 'r e gonna like what we find
we were exploring the concept of a dream within a dream
i wanted to go deeper and deeper
i wanted to go further
i just didn 't understand the concept that hours could turn into years down there
that we could get trapped so deep
we built a world for ourselves
we did that for years
we built our own world
how long were you stuck there ?
how could you stand it ?
it wasn 't so bad at first
the problem was that i knew that none of that was real
eventually it has became impossible for me to live like that
and what about for her ?
she has locked something away
the truth that she once known
what happened when you woke up ?
well to wake up from that after after years after decades to become old souls thrown back into youth like that
i knew something was wrong with her
she just wouldn 't admit it
eventually she told me the truth
she was possessed by an idea
this one very simple idea that changed everything
that our world wasn 't real
that she needed to wake up to come back to reality that in order to get back home
we had to kill ourselves
what about your children ?
she thought they were UNknown
that our real children are waiting for us out there somewhere
can 't you even tell the difference ?
if this is my dream why can 't i control this ?
because you don 't know you 'r e dreaming !
she was certain there was nothing i could do no matter how much i begged no matter how much i pleaded
she wanted to do it
but she could not do it alone
she loved me too much so
she came up with a plan on our anniversary
just step back inside alright ?
i 'm going to jump and you 'r e coming with me
but now you listen to me
if you jump you 'r e not gonna wake up remember ?
you 'r e gonna die
now just step back inside come on
step back inside so we can talk about this
you know i can 't do that
take a second and think about our children
if i go without you they UNknown l take them away anyway
what does that mean ?
i filed a letter with our attorney explaining how i 'm fearful for my safety
how you threatened to kill me
why did you do that ?
why did you why why would you do this to me ?
i UNknown e freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them
we 'r e going home
mal look at me please
you 'r e waiting for a train
don 't do this !
a train that will take you far away
james and UNknown are waiting for you !
you know where you hope this train will take you
they 'r e waiting for us !
but you can 't know for sure
mal look at me !
but it doesn 't matter
because you will be together
sweetheart look at me !
she had herself declared sane by three different psychiatrists
that made it impossible for me to try to explain the nature of her madness
right now or never cobb
i left my children behind and i UNknown e been trying to buy myself back ever since
it 's what powers her
but you are not responsible for the idea that destroyed her
and if we are gonna succeed in this you have to forgive yourself
you 'r e gonna have to confront her
but you don 't have to do that alone
no no you don 't
i 'm doing it for the others
because they have no idea of the risk they UNknown e taken coming down here with you
i don 't know any combination
how about instinctively huh ?
i got somebody standing in front of his office right now ready to tap in the combination
i need the first six numbers that come to your head right now
i said right now !
5 2 8 4 9 1
we 'r e going for a ride
what more do you like ?
what did you get ?
that boy 's relationship with his father is even worse than we imagined
this helps us how ?
the stronger the issues the more powerful the UNknown
how are you gonna reconcile then pursue his UNknown ?
UNknown are closing in quick
you mustn 't be afraid to dream a little bigger darling
now we need to shift his UNknown from his father to his godfather
we 'r e gonna destroy his one positive relationship ?
no we UNknown l repair his relationship with his father by exposing his godfather 's true nature
we should thrice fischer 's loot more than saito 's mission
what about his security ?
it 's gonna get worse as we go deeper
who 's mr charles ?
the second we get into that hotel and approach fischer his security will be all over us
we run with mr charles like we did on this timed job
so you UNknown e done it before ?
yeah and it didn 't worked
but you UNknown e learned a lot right ?
how about a lovely lady that i UNknown e used before ?
you drive carefully alright ?
yeah getting down there is gonna be unstable as hell
don 't jump too soon
we only have one shot at that kick you 'r e gonna make
i UNknown l play the music and you UNknown l know it 's coming the rest is on you
am i boring you ?
i was telling you my story
i guess it wasn 't to your liking
i have a lot in my mind
pleasure to see you again
in case you get bored
she must have blown you off
the wallet alone is worth at least 500 right ?
listen don 't worry about it
my people are already on it as we speak
who or what is mr charles ?
it 's a UNknown designed to turn fischer against his own subconscious
and why don 't you approve ?
cause it involves telling the mark that he 's dreaming which involves attracting a lot of attention to us
so cobb said he couldn 't do that ?
so now you UNknown e noticed how much time cobb spends doing things he says never to do
mr saito may i have a moment ?
you looked to be UNknown
UNknown on the plane ?
no i mean it 's must closer
it 's yusuf 's driving
i 'm sorry who did you say you were ?
that 's not true at all is it ?
my name is mr charles
you remember me don 't you ?
i 'm the head of your security down here
get out on a different floor and keep moving
we need to buy cobb a lot more time
are you talking about dreams ?
are you talking about UNknown ?
mr fischer i am here to protect you in the event that someone tries to access your mind through your dreams
you 'r e not safe here
they 'r e coming for you
strange weather isn 't it ?
quick give me a kiss
they 'r e still looking at us
yeah it 's worth a shot
we should probably get out of here
you UNknown e actually been trained for this mr fischer
pay attention to the UNknown of the weather the shifting gravity
none of this is real
you 'r e in a dream
now the easiest for you to test yourself is to try to remember how you arrived at this hotel
can you do that ?
i 'm a projection of your subconscious
i was sent here to protect you in the event that UNknown try to pull you into a dream
can you get me out of here ?
what are you doing ?
these men were sent here to UNknown you alright
if you want my help you have to remain calm
i need you to work with me mr fischer
if this is a dream i should just kill myself to wake up right ?
i wouldn 't do that if i were you mr fischer
i believe they have you UNknown and if you pull that trigger you may not wake up
you may go into a further dream state
now you know what i 'm talking about
remember what i said to you
think mr fischer think what do you remember from before this dream ?
there was there was a lot of UNknown
oh my god we UNknown e been kidnapped
where were they holding you ?
they had us in the back of a van
that explains the gravity shifts
it had something to do with something to do with a safe ?
god why is it so hard to remember ?
it 's like trying to remember a dream after you UNknown e woken up
listen it takes years of practice
you and browning has been pulled into this dream because they 'r e trying to steal something from your mind
i need you to focus and try and remember what that is
they demanded the first numbers to pop into my head
they 'r e trying to extract the number from your subconscious
we 'r e in a hotel right now
we should try hotel rooms
what was the number mr fischer ?
try and remember for me
it was something it was a long number
so do you use a timer ?
no i have to judge it for myself
while you 'r e all asleep in 528 i UNknown l wait for yusuf 's kick
well how will you know ?
and then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge that should be unmistakable
so we get a nice UNknown kick
if it 's too soon we won 't get pulled out
if it 's too late
i won 't be able to drop us
cause of the van that will be in free fall
mr charles do you know what that is mr fischer ?
yeah i think so yeah
they were trying to put you under
what do you mean ?
i see you UNknown e changed
i UNknown e mistaken you for a friend
good looking fella i 'm sure
that 's fischer 's projection of browning
you said you were kidnapped together ?
and you saw them torture him ?
you 'r e trying to get that safe open ?
so you get the alternate will ?
fischer morrow has been my entire life
i can 't let you destroy it
i 'm not gonna throw away my inheritance
i couldn 't let you rise to your father 's last taunt
the will robert that will
that 's his last insult
a challenge for you to build something for yourself by telling you you 'r e not worthy of his accomplishments
what that he was disappointed hmm ?
you can build a better company than he ever did
how do you know ?
trust me it 's what i do
he 's hiding something and we need to find out what that is
i need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you
wait whose subconscious are we going into exactly ?
we 'r e going into fischer 's
but i told him it was browning 's so he can be a part of our team
he 's gonna help us break into his own subconscious
security 's gonna run you down huh
and i will lead them on a merry chase
just be back here for the kick
go to sleep mr UNknown
i 'm i 'm fine
what 's down there ?
hopefully the truth we want fischer to learn
i mean what 's down there for you ?
did you see that ?
UNknown this is your dream
i need you to draw the security away from the complex you understand ?
find all the route everything could be compromised
no you 'r e with me
alright you UNknown l reach on the route into the complex
i UNknown l be listening in the whole time
the windows on that upper floor are big enough for me to cover you from that south tower
you 'r e not coming in ?
in order to find out the truth about your father you 'r e gonna need to break into browning 's mind on your own
so they 'r e shooting me !
i hope they 'r e ready
cobb do you hear that ?
first heard it about twenty minutes ago
i thought it was the wind up here
yusuf 's ten seconds for the jump
can they make that route in under an hour ?
they still have to climb down to the middle terrace
well then they need a new route
it 's designed as a labyrinth
did UNknown add any features ?
i don 't think i should tell you
we don 't have time for this
did he add any ?
cobb did we miss it ?
couldn 't you instead just have dreamt of a goddamn beach ?
what the hell do we do now ?
we finish the job before the next kick
how do i drop you without gravity ?
arthur has a couple of minutes we have about twenty
they 'r e heading your way like they know something
just buy us some more time alright ?
that 's the UNknown it 's just stronger
was it stronger if it have any windows ?
no i mean it wouldn 't be very strong if it did
let 's hope fischer likes what he finds in there
they 'r e just UNknown
you 'r e clear but hurry
there 's an entire army headed your way
there 's someone else in there
no she is not real !
how do you know that ?
she is just a projection
get to the UNknown now !
i couldn 't shoot her
but there 's no use in UNknown him his mind 's already trapped down there
so that 's it ?
well it 's not me who 's gonna get back to my family is it ?
it 's a shame i really want to know what 's gonna happen in there
i swear we have this one
let 's set the charges
no there 's still another way
we just have to follow fischer down there
we don 't have time
no but there will be enough time down there
and we will find him
okay as soon as arthur 's music kicks in just use the UNknown to revive him
we can give him his own kick down below
look you get him in there
as soon as the music ends you blow up the hospital
and we all ride the kick back up the layers
that 's worth a shot
and saito can hold the guards out while i set the charges
saito will never make it will he ?
we UNknown e got to try
look if we 'r e not that fully kicked i am gonna leave in vain
can i trust you to do what 's gonna happen here ?
i mean mal 's gonna be down there
i know where to find her
she UNknown l have fischer
how do you know ?
she wants me to come after her she wants me back down there with her
i need you i need you to take care of fischer while i go set some charges okay ?
no room for tourists on this jobs
you built all these ?
the place is from my past
that was our first apartment and we moved to that building right there
after mal became pregnant that became our home
you UNknown all of these from memory ?
like i told you we have lots of time
it 's the house mal grew up with
we both wanted to live in a house but we love this type of building
in the real world we 'd have to choose but not here
how are you gonna bring fischer back ?
the smallest seed of an idea can grow
it can grown to define or destroy you
the smallest idea such as
your world is not real
simple little thought that changes everything
so certain of your world
of what 's real ?
do you think he is ?
why do you think he 's as lost as i was ?
i know it 's real mal
not feeling persecuted UNknown ?
chased around the globe by anonymous UNknown and police forces ?
you know what i have to do i have to get back to our children because you left them
and you 'd like to see their faces again wouldn 't you ?
yes but i want to see them up above mal
don 't do this mal please
those aren 't my children
you keep telling yourself that but you don 't believe it
what if you 'r e wrong ?
what if i 'm what 's real ?
you keep telling yourself what you know
but what do you believe ?
and no matter what i do no matter how hopeless i am no matter how confused that guilt is always there reminding me of the truth
the idea that caused you to question your reality came from me
you planted the idea in my mind ?
what is she talking about ?
the reason i knew UNknown was possible was because i did it to her first
we were lost in here
i knew we needed to escape but she wouldn 't accept it
she had locked something away something deep inside
the truth that she had once known but she chose to forget
she couldn 't break free
so i decided to search for it
going deep into the recess of her mind and found that secret place
i broke in and i planted an idea
a simple idea that i knew would change everything
that her world wasn 't real
that death was the only escape
you 'r e waiting for a train
a train that will take you far away
you know where you hope this train will take you
but you can 't know for sure !
and it doesn 't matter !
now tell me why !
that death was the only escape
you 'r e UNknown my mind
i was trying to save you
you betrayed me but you can make amends
you can still keep your promise
we can still be together right here
in the world we built together
cobb we need to get fischer
you can 't have him
if i stay here will you let him go ?
what are you talking about ?
fischer 's on the porch
go check if he 's alive UNknown
cobb you can 't do this
he 's here and it 's time but you have to come now !
take fischer with you alright ?
you can 't stay here to be with her !
saito 's dead by now that means he 's down here somewhere
that means i have to find him
i can 't stay with her anymore because she doesn 't exist
i wish more than anything but i can 't imagine you with all your UNknown
you 'r e just a shade
you 'r e just a shade of my real wife
and you are the best that i could do but i 'm sorry you 'r e just not good enough
this will feel real ?
get in there now !
i know you were disappointed
i couldn 't be you
i was disappointed that you tried
come on come on come on !
that 's the kick UNknown !
you have to go now !
don 't lose yourself !
find saito and bring him back !

UNknown and jacinto are already helping out
let 's give them a big hand
so UNknown has anybody volunteered ?
i wanted to find my UNknown something to do

we like them when they are this pretty
it would be great for her
she 's a hard worker and great in the kitchen
you UNknown l be very happy with her
what do you say father ?
you didn 't notice ?
that man isn 't here taking pictures
and he didn 't buy the paper today
i can tell you 'r e very well informed
i 'm not one to judge
but you know about him ; he 's a bad example for the kids
i don 't find the painter to be a bad person
i mean he gave me a candle at the market
can you believe what she told me ?
he gave me a candle
can you believe it ?
they are best friends now
i don 't like that man at all
always taking pictures always quiet looking
i hope he goes back to where he came from
they said he came to paint ; i haven 't seen one painting so far
i 'm sure they kicked him out of his house
you know why right ?
and he had no choice but to come here
you think the painter is ?
they UNknown e seen him with magazines of naked men
i could eat him up !
you 'r e stopping me sleeping
what are you doing here ?

the word of the lord
yes it 's just hot
i don 't know what 's happening
i don 't know why i 'm here but i need to talk to you
reading from the gospel of saint luke
those among you who having 100 sheep

i don 't like those at all
i prefer the UNknown by far
they 'r e great !

football football and more football
i 'm fed up with football !
miguel is like that but he watches this one
they 'r e showing it again

it 's better like this huh ?
let 's go for a walk
give me a break !
i UNknown l match your two and raise two more okay ?
you UNknown l need at least a flush
i didn 't find anything
the ocean is getting clearer
i waited a long time to hear this and look when you decide to tell me
we couldn 't before but now we can
i thought you were happy
i 'm happy when i 'm with you but when i 'm not i 'm fucked
what are you going to promise me ?
don 't you realise ?
i know i can 't promise you anything but i 'd love you to stay with me
what do you mean nothing ?
put your clothes on please !
i had one too many
what 's going on miguel ?
you haven 't come to confession
don 't tell UNknown please
i don 't go around gossiping
but i want you to promise me that i won 't see you drunk or naked again !
he UNknown l be like your dad
i thought i heard him
i look ugly like this right ?
not at all why ?
what do you think happened to the painter ?
what would i know ?
nobody has seen him in days
a little strange don 't you think ?
leaving all his things behind
i thought you might be friends
how could he be my friend ?
come on i know where we can go
okay i 'm done here
i UNknown l go see if miguel needs help
UNknown i haven 't said a word
it was probably jacinto who spread the gossip
where are UNknown and the others ?
this is what they do on sundays
why are you asking me ?
i haven 't seen it
you don 't have to
how do you know ?
i never talked to that fag !
maybe he took your photo
you don 't believe me do you ?
you don 't believe me ? !
i don 't know miguel
they saw you walking out of his house
if you want to mess around with that guy it 's your problem
but chino you have a wife
you have to respect her so that others respect her
you 'r e going to be a father
you UNknown l have a son
everybody 's telling me you 'r e fucking that guy
even the women are saying it and it bothers me
think of your wife your family
think of your kid growing up
i 'm not a fag !
you are the fag UNknown !
i know you 'r e here !
i thought you never talked to this fag
i told you to never paint me
it was for me not them
the whole town thinks i 'm a fag now !
you are not a fag
you know why not ?
cause you gotta have balls to be one
you 'r e a coward that thinks being a man is about having a wife and kids
shut the fuck up !
there are a thousand ways to be a man
and you are none of them !
you think you are a man ?
who are you trying to fool man ?
you 'r e afraid to accept that you love me
i can 't love you UNknown
i work hard for them
and they behave like this
she said it just like that
she 's becoming more and more like her mother
why didn 't you send them all to hell ?
i wouldn 't cry in front of them
i UNknown e known miguel since he was a kid
a stupid painting is not going to make us doubt him
i can 't do it
a little later and you would UNknown e missed it !
he 's just like you man
you are a dad now UNknown !
our son was born tonight
none of you came by the house
what are you doing ?
what happened with hector ?
it doesn 't seem that stupid
he hasn 't come to see UNknown
i hit him a bit too hard
i UNknown l apologise to him
i UNknown l come home early
what about that painting ?
i don 't know if it 's true
i haven 't posed for that guy i swear
why do they say you two
that 's why i 'm asking you !
it 's better to enter into life without a hand than with two hands to go to hell to the fire that never goes out
if your foot should cause you to sin cut it off
it 's better to enter into life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into hell
miguel what 's wrong ?
it 's true wasn 't it ?
i 'm not like that i swear !
besides he 's gone for good
i 'm sick of your swearing !
i can 't go on
but i didn 't want you to leave so i tied it tightly to a rock
and now it 's gone
i didn 't want that to happen
i think i could make us all happy
i can 't do any more
i have a son UNknown
i have to give him a family
i want to ask you one last thing
don 't call me any more
don 't look for me any more
i 'm sorry to come this late
what do you think ?
how 's UNknown doing ?
please tell UNknown i UNknown l be at home waiting for her
it doesn 't matter how long i UNknown l wait for her
it 's best that we separate for a while to think
i UNknown e got nothing to think about
i want to be with you
you won 't believe me but it 's true
what do you want me to do ?
what would you do ?
i 'd never do that
i didn 't think you would either
if i ever hear that either of you two has said anything about my husband
i swear i UNknown l take your eyes out
you UNknown e had bad luck all day
ready to play with your master ?
you UNknown l have to wait
you 'r e dying to tell me
it wasn 't a sea lion
it was the body of a man
his face was almost gone but they are sure it is the painter
father juan already blessed his body and he 's trying to find his family
they took it to the doctor 's office
it UNknown l stay there until they come to claim it
why are you telling me this ?
because if i don 't tell you nobody else will
i thought you might want to know
do you hear it ?
i live there when i 'm not here
you see how beautiful it is ?
the most beautiful in the world
we were looking at the ocean right ?
and he didn 't cry ?
he never cries with you
i 'm going to get jealous
i UNknown l heat it up
you knew that right ?
i want to bury him mari
father juan took care of him
his family is arriving tomorrow to take him
he didn 't give a fuck about our traditions
he wouldn 't have wanted
if i don 't do it he won 't rest
do you think they UNknown l let you bury their rich kid here ?
i owe it to him
you 'r e his father right ?
i 'm doing it because of him
don 't be so selfish
yes so that he can have a father he can respect
how can i teach him to be a man if i 'm not one ?
he won 't know !
in a few years nobody will remember
why do you have to drag us all into your shit ?
mari it 's the last thing i swear
you 'r e swearing again
but i won 't stay to see it
where will you go ?
he UNknown l come with me
you still love him don 't you ?
i UNknown l be with you soon
i UNknown e come to claim santiago la rosa 's body
i want to offer it
you still have it right ?
they 'r e picking up his things
there 's nothing for you to do
what the fuck do you know ?
his painting improved a lot here don 't you think ?
he never wanted people to see them
he was very protective of his paintings
i don 't know haw to pose
i swear i never posed
he told me about you
he called me to tell me he was with somebody
i didn 't say anything
i didn 't even ask him your name
i didn 't know what to tell him
so i pretended i hadn 't heard him
after that he never told me anything else about you
he called me like always of course but
he never talked like before
he said he painted because of you
i UNknown e come to ask you something very important
not for me for santiago
he wanted to be buried here in the ocean
i UNknown e come to ask for your permission
thank you miguel but we will bury him next to his father
i came to take my son with me and that 's what i UNknown l do
i 'm sure he wouldn 't wanted you to keep it
my wife is leaving me perhaps for good
and she 's taking our son with her
she 's leaving me because i 'm here asking you to let me keep the promise i made your son
santiago wanted to be buried here if i don 't do it he won 't rest
do you realise what you 'r e asking ?
you know it isn 't me who 's asking
i want you to support him and give him company
this goes out to those of you who want to listen
i miguel UNknown stand before my church and community to give proper burial to the lifeless body of santiago la rosa
may this ceremony please our lord and may he have mercy on santiago
so that as we take care of his body
he may take care of his soul and ensure that it may never wander without rest but find eternal peace in his glory
don 't smoke in here !
what 's this farce with the americans ?
whatever you 'r e doing it 's not gonna work
it 's too late i 'm afraid
i 'm not so sure
we UNknown e talked this over a hundred times
you don 't need to do this
you 'r e educated a good drawer
you 'r e not in for long
yo draw me some pussy !
you can use the time
once you 'r e out the world 's yours
you want me to be like them ?
this place used to be a psychiatric hospital once
i don 't want her mixed in it
maybe escape is a bad idea ?
you UNknown l have to hide
you can 't just buy a flat
that 's why they put you in jail after all
you know i was set up by my partner
you should UNknown e testified
i UNknown l handle it myself
you know the code of honor ?
you owe me a box of smokes
every day give one pack to my guy
you don 't smoke anyway
be strong or you UNknown l break her heart if she really loves you
that 's what really matters now
ls the place UNknown ?
there 's a guard there
and a mole in the cell is cheaper
what shall i say ?
can we touch here ?
lf you can 't just let it go
want me to buy you something ?
i have everything i need
the lawyer says that the new regulations allow him to file for your parole again
he 's putting you on
we know everything about new regulations here
i UNknown e finished reading this
very interesting speech by senator UNknown on the defense of democracy
you can get me another volume
you must arrange that session as soon as possible
be at the office tomorrow
i 'm meeting the editor
it 's like st UNknown
i 'm worried that she 's not cut out for that
she 's just too good hearted
that 's a good one !
where did you get it ?
ln a fun stuff store ?
when he went out for beer yesterday
they UNknown e just filed for the UNknown 's case
changes in school monitoring policy law so his son can make a fortune
and you 'r e proud of it ?
lf you want to promote free press
lsn 't that what you taught me ? !
we UNknown e been sued for half a million !
ls that enough for you ?
what would you do in my place ?
i UNknown l take that commentary back
i UNknown l write a letter of apology right away
good you 'r e here
they UNknown e rented a suite
i could handle that myself
it 's the best way
let 's not discuss it again please
UNknown council contacted our embassy in UNknown
they want our troops out of afghanistan
for just one mp ?
the army is a cover
it 's always about money
can you recapture the hostage ?
we have no intelligence there
we 'd need our allies assistance
what about the finances ?
after the latest scandal we must be very cautious
it 's an extraordinary situation
the life of the polish mp is at stake
six million is a problem ? !
UNknown members don 't pay terrorists
that 's the latest resolution
what about an unofficial way ?
unofficially companies may pay for their abducted employees
but this is an mp
last night on the border of afghanistan and UNknown a polish mp jan UNknown has been abducted
ai UNknown has broadcast a short film
please be advised of its violent content
good it 's only an mp
his kind deserves good spanking
to the ministry of defense and the polish government please withdraw our troops
they 'r e not to be blamed
this is not our war
i 'd like to present a different option to prime minister
UNknown affairs will take charge of it along with vice minister UNknown and his department
we 'r e looking at some work here
but for you boss we 'd be stuck here all day
who 's to be the UNknown ?
i can barely speak russian
he wasn 't kidnapped by the russians
and UNknown most probably speak their UNknown language
the embassy has an interpreter
he must be on his way now
i UNknown e got a boo boo
we have to buy out our mp from the UNknown
the government 's set up a crisis group
we do the job as usual
UNknown will fill you in he is the UNknown
that 's why you UNknown l be in charge of the operation
we risk a lot so no one may learn about my plan
UNknown will fly off to UNknown and start negotiating with the kidnappers
he UNknown l prolong it
it isn 't a significant group
they seem to care only about the money
i thought you wanted it quick and effective
it UNknown l take about two weeks
what do you mean print ?
it 's about that pro you busted
what about the agency ?
won 't they watch over us ?
we 'r e trying to obtain the real cash at the same time
i UNknown l take care of that
when the UNknown figure it out they UNknown l kill me and the hostage
we UNknown l test the dollars
he tricked even the us federal bank
what if we get the real money ?
then we UNknown l split the forged cash between us
off to the warden 's office
major bukowski from the ministry
i UNknown e an official proposition for you
how can i be of any use ?
you UNknown l get back to the printing press for a while
i need six million in two weeks
lf you do it well we UNknown l reduce your time by one third
i UNknown l get that for good conduct
i need two weeks to prepare the UNknown
my mechanic UNknown 's doing time in UNknown
we UNknown e got your UNknown
we UNknown l release the mechanic
otherwise you UNknown l do the full time without parole
i UNknown l think it over and let you know tomorrow
i 'd rather you did it today
we 'r e pressed for time
i UNknown l do my best
lf everything works out you UNknown l go back for a year
in a minimum security unit
we UNknown l negotiate tomorrow
from the UNknown point of view we shouldn 't pay the ransom
yet we can 't recapture the mp by force
i understand you have some options ?
we may ask pakistan the release of terrorists from the prison
it 's quite unreal but we UNknown l try
we need time to organize the money
they might pay for him
it 's my dad 's
i sold my flat to pay the debts his partner got him in
i moved here but had no heart to get rid of this collection
he 's been collecting them since i remember
i miss him a lot
as if you couldn 't breathe
we wanted to have children
you have no gramophone i have no man
it sucks doesn 't it ?
the guy who busted me wants me now to forge for him
and he offers me freedom
you didn 't wait long
all i know is the last time i did that it turned nasty on me
the government 's UNknown says it 's the priority at the moment
the minister of the UNknown affairs and the administration has sent an experienced UNknown there
i told you they 'd buy the UNknown out
when will you see the chief screw ?
you know what that means ?
every fag 's a cop ?
they are spoiling you here
i haven 't been to theater for 5 years
you UNknown l UNknown the rest of my time
i 'm the boss in the printing house
you release my mechanic and UNknown his time too
i spend nights with my woman
and my UNknown will work in the library
UNknown the rest of your time ?
i can accept the UNknown 's thing his time is almost done
but you may get a temporary leave at best
you UNknown l apply for parole and we shall grant it
there 's nothing to talk about then
the UNknown of your sentence will last at least a year
and we can 't get your girlfriend involved in it
i UNknown l tell her i UNknown e gotten a leave to do social service
you know i keep my mouth shut
take the prisoner to his cell !
we UNknown e got a deal ?
who works for us in UNknown ?
the gentleman 's here for you
i 'm in the embassy in UNknown
should be back in an hour
he 's got your UNknown and an UNknown for you
i 'i i caii you in the evening
everything 's under control mr prime minister
the UNknown is already there
he 's setting out tomorrow
i 'm in touch with the agency
but i have to let him in
you don 't want me to ?
i was thinking about it a lot in the slammer
not enough since you did not allow me to visit you
you haven 't even started yet
i UNknown e got to go
do you need anything else ?
we UNknown e got everything except these
what 's the ge 6 5 paper ?
these are the numbers of UNknown at the UNknown UNknown 's
you just need to confiscate them
we need deliveries from some good restaurant
i also need a UNknown lens
the american paper has red and blue threads
it took us several months to figure out you just need to add some red and blue old clothes
23 linen 7 7 cotton
here 's a UNknown line that says
the united states of america
but you can do this ?
smoke UNknown the quality of print
the soot doesn 't tolerate smoke
what are you doing here ?
i want you to give me a UNknown
on the abduction of UNknown mp
i UNknown l think about it
anything in it for us ?
i UNknown e been sniffing around
i have a gut feeling
it 's just the usual stuff
what about special services ?
why did they send an inexperienced UNknown ?
he doesn 't even know the language
i 'm not surprised by that
they UNknown e got a history of screw ups
just don 't get us in trouble again
they UNknown e been UNknown by the security agency
do you have any contacts there ?
you can 't hide it prime minister
everyone will want to know whether we 'r e paying or not
tell them we 'r e discussing with pakistan the possibility of freeing the hostage
it UNknown l be easier to account for
we 'r e also working on obtaining the cash
it 's to be discarded anyway
you know me don 't you ?
i have a proposition for you
do you sir excuse me
they say all reporters are chain UNknown
does it make them more serious ?
i UNknown e found a lead i need to verify
i want to write an article about it
i know it will be excellent
can you answer a couple of my questions ?
i know it 's confidential but you may have some info by now ?
every detail is of interest to me
we UNknown l make it on time
would you guess it 's counterfeit ?
they 'r e not counterfeit
and they have a value in gold too ?
and what are you doing here now ?
for a professional service we want to let a criminal walk free
but it gives you no remorse does it ?
you can 't fix it
where can you get one ?
the printing house of the polish publishing agency
they must have a pump !
they did when i worked for them five years ago
do we have anyone in there ?
we UNknown l do it my way
you 'r e coming with me
you UNknown l show me the way
how can i help you ?
we 'r e investigating the promotion of fascism
your printing house is involved
the pump in our printing house broke
we have some urgent work to do
what 's it called ? !
UNknown is for making passports important documents
it 's only for the government 's orders
yes but you printed german papers 3 months ago 1 00 000 of them
that was no government 's order
the order came from abroad
it was paid in UNknown ln advance
we must earn our living
a UNknown UNknown nazi UNknown ?
you know it 's against the law
it was a one time business
what do you want me to say ?
i didn 't arrange it !
here 's what we UNknown l do
we should finish by tomorrow
they UNknown l probably take me straight back to the slammer
you think that bukowski will keep his word ?
i want to go to a desert island
i haven 't predicted that
i UNknown e good news for you
your products passed the test
why have you brought me down here ?
what are your plans for the future ?
you don 't know my offer yet
i don 't even want to hear it
i UNknown l get him !
you 'r e not made to be a hero
next time i won 't save you
the box to the office
what about me now ?
gotta be in to get out
how about the negotiations ?
do you know anything yet ?
they 'r e within our interest too
strange they have sent an inexperienced UNknown there
but something else bothers me
why are you so much into this case ?
you know i 'm a journalist
maybe you could give me some information ?
he 's in a minimum security prison and his time 's almost done
he didn 't come back from work
a prisoner went out to town ?
we UNknown l get him
let 's not stir things up now
how 's your UNknown ?
yes we 'r e almost through
takes you a lot of time
can 't the ministry of finance spare six million ?
it 's not within the interest of your department
my department likes to keep an eye on everything
yeah it 's getting tense
will you tell me what it 's about ?
we UNknown e some bills to check
can you look at them please ?
there are some differences but we must remember
americans print them at several different locations
the color and UNknown too
i 'd have to take some time over their serial numbers
they don 't seem to have been used
so they aren 't counterfeit ?
amateurs think hundred dollar bills are the easiest as they are only green and black
americans make other bills colorful
hundreds will be colorful too after UNknown optical paint is applied
i knew one polish specialist for dollars
he was busted some 2 years ago ?
what makes you so happy ?
so they UNknown e gathered it
here 's the accountant and the courier
there was a call from the airport
undoubtedly the life of the hostage was a priority
the money 's gone the mp 's back
i must apologize for not telling you everything
they wanted to get UNknown out of politics
they had some UNknown stuff on him
the UNknown took money for the masquerade
i used my old contacts to get to them
so we killed two birds with one stone
the mp is coming back as a hero and we UNknown l split the money
where was he then ?
let 's go to my place and have some drinks
you aren 't mad are you ?
UNknown wanted me tell you once he 'd be safe
they 'r e UNknown in the dark
it was a pure coincidence
i don 't believe in coincidence
why 'r e you walking around like that ?
they won 't let you out after all
don 't piss me off !
we UNknown l keep on working
have you got it ?
you UNknown l call when the guard 's off to the loo
are you gonna stick to the deal ?
i 'm in the slammer if you care to know
good you UNknown e called
we UNknown e got problems with your product plus you 'r e looking at some new charges from paragraph 1 48
remember the gun you played with recently ?
it 's part of evidence
be nice or we UNknown l speed up the investigation
a little to the side
which book can you recommend ?
what about the memories of a blue uniform ?
great plan you UNknown e devised there
adventure of a lifetime ?
i hope there 'r e no more left
once i discovered he has an account in switzerland
he keeps all his extra money there
now i happened to come across those porn shots
the whole parliament know the pleasures he 's after
i didn 't get the girls for him
it 's just that one photographer owed me a favor
the inmates may use some entertainment
so we have to organize something like every year right ?
what 's it gonna be this time ?
so what do you suggest then ?
we UNknown e never had that before
there is one spectacular number
what do you need ?
as a guarantor of the agreement between convict UNknown
and major bukowski i decided to fulfill my obligation
and ask for this convict to be released
please check if all the ransom money
for the freedom and life of the polish mp
manufactured under UNknown UNknown to 6 000 000
was duly deployed i 'm sending you one biil
and the UNknown numbers of the remaining ones
UNknown prison manager UNknown UNknown
that letter wasn 't written by the prison manager was it ?
what do you know ?
it 's your job isn 't it ?
that 'd be an international scandal
i know nothing about politics
i don 't give a damn
you don 't give a damn ?
so maybe you don 't have to remember certain things ?
seems there are more people with good memory involved
who do you mean ?
i just asked him to send a UNknown
what about professor 's daughter ?
it 's professor 's business
i stay out of it
i can see two ways out
you keep your mouth shut or you keep your mouth shut
i 'm pretty interested in the way out
and i like to keep my mouth shut out in the fresh air
fresh air is scarce now
i was thinking about UNknown
but it 's an ultimate guarantee
what if i secured myself ?
what do i get for that UNknown of yours ?
have you considered why they abducted that mp ?
i UNknown l tell you the rest on route
no one may know about this
this is a crime prime minister
do you realize what scandal that would be ? !
poland like north korea prints dollars ? !
what about the witnesses ?
i expect your immediate decisions !
i 'm calling to confirm whether convict UNknown arrived in warsaw as planned ?
i have a signed transport documents here
i can 't give you any information now
we UNknown l check it and let you know as soon as possible
please remember that you are under an obligation of secrecy
where 's the main entrance ?
i UNknown l be right there !
how long have you known UNknown ?
i UNknown e never seen him
once i ran an investigation into his party finances
why did you come with this to me ?
you knew we 'd check it all
so what did you find out ?
what do you mean by 'n o ?
did you know your father 's partner ?
what does it matter ?
why didn 't you do it ?
he was afraid UNknown could recognize me as a journalist
are you angry about that ?
the conditions of this place will make this number special
i 'm pretty curious myself
he UNknown l climb back over the wall
he showed me that yesterday
to be continued in a week !
a nuclear gap in the wall !
he 's been working long on this
now he 's getting out of the wall and into the street
i can see him !
back to their cells !
i UNknown l go outside
how was the journey ?
can 't remember a thing
UNknown and UNknown will stay here
they UNknown l make it
they UNknown l get out soon they have bank accounts best lawyers
they UNknown e been arranged for
it doesn 't look so easy
do you speak french ?
it 's too early for UNknown release
but your case is a priority for my office
we 'r e to be getting ready
and that other car ?
i left the keys in the ignition
it UNknown l make someone happy
they must have received it by now
you 'r e under arrest
do you recognize me ?

you see that minister ?
my daughter is marrying a president
are you coming to celebrate the bar UNknown tonight ?
rabbi jacob i must confess something
well nevertheless you can remain
your one and only source into the scandalous
are you kidding me ?
tell me why you 'r e drinking alone and i UNknown l you anything you want
i thought i could start over but it turns out college is just high school with more expensive books
now i 'm in with serena and i can find something even bigger to take her down with
i better not find out that this was about protecting nate
if you 'r e falling for him
you sure about this ?
the captain is being charged with embezzlement and fraud
there 's a different way to get our lives back dad one that doesn 't require another felony
you be a man and you turn yourself in
the moment you slept with jenny humphrey that was the best thing that ever happened to me because i got over you
if that 's the truth then why haven 't you told anyone about jenny ?
i need to get an interview for someone who will be applying to parsons
they say waking up is hard to do
especially when you 'r e not alone
what have we here ?
oh well you showed him
it turns out he actually has some UNknown qualities
he 's handsome in an old hollywood way
and even though he 's a businessman he 's more interested in talking about UNknown and UNknown which he collects by the way
so what are you doing here ?
he also collects women that he puts into cabs a new one each morning and i 'm not gonna be one of them
what 's wrong with you ?
i had another chuck nightmare
i was in wait until dark
and i knew that he was there just lying in wait like in real life
but then when he attacked me he turned out to be a she
like chuck in drag or an actual girl ?
i don 't know !
but then why a girl ?
and that hair so long and
b hey can we talk about this on our way to school ?
i have no excuse for being late for a class and i promised the dean i 'd be a model student
uh i 'm gonna meet you there
what are you doing up so early ?
oh just visiting my dad
thought i 'd check in
probably for the best though right ?
so uh what about you ?
how was your big night with juliet ?
what do you mean ?
so i thought she 'd want to hang
you know maybe have breakfast at tom 's stay in bed all day
right well i 'm gonna ignore the fact that you have the best problems ever and tell you just not to read too much into it
oh so the campus crusade continues ?
you haven 't punished blair enough for driving eva away ?
as i told her i UNknown e hardly begun
from what i hear they UNknown e got someone big to replace martha for the psychology of business lecture
apparently he 's fortune 500
i 'm curious to meet the man see what lessons there are to be learned
speaking of where 's blair ?
don 't tell me she threw in the towel after just one round ?
she UNknown l be here
uh if you UNknown l excuse me i 'm going to sit with them
from what i hear UNknown players know how to handle a UNknown
what are you doing here ?
don 't tell me you 'r e
then again so can our nightmares
we UNknown e missed you
blair whatever you 'r e about to do my dad and lily are gonna be home any minute
not to worry little j
this is going to be a very short conversation
i let you walk away after you UNknown yourself out to chuck because i assumed you were smart enough never to come back
i might UNknown e been willing to make exceptions for holidays birthdays health emergencies of immediate family members but i don 't believe any of those UNknown apply
blair i 'm just here for one day
i have an interview with tim UNknown and if everything goes well then he UNknown l write me a recommendation letter for parsons
it 's a hundred blocks away from the upper east side UNknown
if people think i 'm not a woman of my word the whole system could break down
look blair i 'm not looking to UNknown your social order
you know how much fashion means to me and parsons is the school for it
i UNknown l call you a car to take you back to hudson and wait while you pack
how about a day pass ?
i promise i UNknown l leave directly after my interview
and you know who knows if tim UNknown 's even gonna like my work ?
but either way i promise i won 't set foot in manhattan for the rest of the year not even christmas
it 's been on my wish list for quite some time
running into each other at a prison
that 's kind of awkward
yeah especially because you said you were going to class
no i wasn 't following you okay ?
i 'm visiting my dad
he 's in for fraud and embezzlement
he just got transferred down from upstate
why didn 't you tell me ?
well it 's usually not a part of my a game pillow talk
i mean it was in all the papers
i thought you might know and and i wouldn 't have to talk about it
no i i didn 't
i wasn 't living in the city then
it 's nice to actually have someone to talk to who might understand
so who are you here for ?
for the prison UNknown program
why didn 't you just tell me that this morning ?
look all i wanted to do was stay in bed with you and
i guess i just felt weird bailing on you for some convicts
like you said not exactly the best pillow talk
well i think it 's great you do something like that
all right i gotta get going before my dad wonders where i am
i just got a text message saying that my session was canceled
you are never going to believe who 's back in town
our new psychology of business professor is colin the guy from last night
what are the odds ?
i can 't believe this is happening
i 'm already on thin ice with the dean
i really like him though
but i UNknown l talk to him
she must have a lot of nerve considering you banned her from the city
if people found out she defied you they won 't
and let me remind you
i sent her packing for both of our sakes
if it was ever made public that you had a dangerous liaison with a teenage UNknown who also technically is your UNknown you 'd be socially UNknown
well i 'd be mad to have anything to do with her return then wouldn 't i ?
arthur pull the car around
it 's time to make the stop i requested
i need you three little pigs to UNknown and puff over to the van der UNknown
you 'r e on UNknown
she 's violating your order to exile ?
i gave her a day pass but she is not to move one inch outside that building without me knowing
nothing could be more entertaining than bottle blonde UNknown
but we UNknown l still dying to know why you deported jenny in the first place
yours is not to wonder why
i can 't believe i didn 't know you were coming back
well i 'm only here for a day
i didn 't want to make a big deal out of it
if dad put out a spread like this every time you came home
well these are so lovely
i can see why tim UNknown is dying to meet with you
he knows what i do
parsons would be lucky to have her
hey how about uh dinner at UNknown tonight celebrate us all being back together ?
um i 'd actually kinda rather stay in if that 's okay
when have you ever passed up UNknown ?
yeah i know but i have a um a couple finishing touches to do on my dresses so if you guys will excuse me
okay so what 's really going on ?
well blair stopped by with her welcome wagon
i don 't know why
i thought i could sneak back in for a day but
well how did she know you were here before i did ?
she 's the wicked witch of the upper east side
you know i 'm sure one of her monkeys spotted me getting off the train or something
she 's giving me a day pass as long as i don 't see or talk to anyone
yeah it is 100 vintage crazy ass blair
but really though i mean i have no interest in going back to being g i jenny and UNknown with blair
how very UNknown of you
but in case eastern philosophy does fail you how about i meet you downtown after my class and i can escort you back up here ?
i UNknown l deal with him
i heard jenny was back
i wanted to speak with her
i 'm sorry for taking advantage of you
and letting my psycho ex girlfriend run you out of town ?
something like that except without the sarcasm
yeah well i think i can deliver that message and i think you can find the elevator
oh how can i argue with big brother ?
i UNknown l just grab these blueprints lily left for me
i UNknown l let you get back to your hemingway complex
you know i almost respect this side to you humphrey
you raced out of class pretty fast
was i that boring ?
come to think of it you raced off pretty fast this morning as well
well i know the routine
i wanted to save you the effort of walking me out and UNknown me a cab
does that mean you think last night was a mistake ?
i had a lot of fun last night which is why i didn 't want you to think
i was one of your usual conquests
you made that pretty clear last night when you declined to be conquered
all of this however was before i found out you were my professor
and relationships with faculty are strictly forbidden and i i don 't want last night to affect how you treat me as a student
i UNknown e gotta say that didn 't sound very heartfelt
wanna try it again with a little more conviction ?
i UNknown e said what i needed to say
you can have the t a mark my papers
may i offer a UNknown ?
i have to go to this party tonight for the new york observer
i 'm getting some kind of eligible bachelor award
will you come with me ?
wouldn 't bringing a date make you UNknown for an award like that ?
maybe having you on my arm would be honor enough
if i give up my bachelor title and commit to getting to know you better maybe you could put off UNknown the psychology of business for another semester ?
well it 's not like business is my major
and it 's still the add drop period so
i UNknown l pick you up
why are you calling me ?
i understand your reluctance to ever speak to me again
and i don 't wanna bother you
i was picking up some bass industries blueprints earlier and it seems i UNknown took your UNknown
chuck i don 't know what type of game you 'r e playing but my interview 's in an hour
you have to bring it back right now
i would of course but i 'm heading into a meeting i can 't UNknown
i 'm not supposed to go anywhere but my interview and i definitely can 't see you
so you won 't have to
i left it at the front desk with my concierge
b s disciples hot on little j s tail
and hopefully it 's about to get more so
don 't tell me you lost her
watch out j break a deal with the devil
she just walked into the empire
i need the address of tim UNknown 's studio
and there will be hell to pay
dan you didn 't have to meet me here
besides i 'm already late
i was in the neighborhood
i had a couple last minute UNknown issues
but the models are already inside getting dressed and mr UNknown is on a very tight schedule today
uh wish me luck ?
i don 't have to
i mean UNknown you 'r e my sister and i love you so i 'm UNknown
but if you can take blair in stride today
tim UNknown will be a piece of cake
i UNknown l be out here waitin for ya
collect call from a UNknown facility
ben i 'm so glad you called
where were you today ?
i thought i told you to stop seeing him
don 't they make you do your homework at columbia ?
i did but he just transferred and i bumped into nate outside
you 'r e wrong about him you know
i mean we we talked
and he 's not like the others
but what happens when he starts asking questions about why ?
you think he 's gonna understand then ?
i don 't want to lie to him anymore
maybe you 'r e right
i UNknown e put a lot on you
you 'r e my little sister
all right i UNknown e gotta get back but i UNknown l call you later
hey you know a new guy in here
what brings you back to the homestead ?
don 't tell me word reached you that rufus is making his famous chili
guess she forgot to call
well i know you two haven 't exactly been the best of friends in the past but maybe that can change now that you UNknown e had some time apart
well as much as i would love to bond with her
i actually have plans special plans that involve me raiding my mother 's jewelry box
hey what are you reading ?
oh it 's just a book by one of my professors
winner ! by colin forrester
a must read for 21st century c e o s
serena i can 't tell you how happy it makes me to see you taking such a challenging course just right out of the gate
all right let 's go find something that UNknown huh ?
especially for someone so young
i yeah fashion 's pretty much the only thing i UNknown e ever cared about
then you left to start your own line
yeah in UNknown it was probably a little too bold
but you must UNknown e patched things up with eleanor because i see you worked together again last year
well there was a a conflict with a different waldorf
but i can assure you that all of that 's behind me now
i think that these dresses really express my take on young women today our sense of self confidence and self worth
this is quite a statement jenny
um no we 'r e done
uh that part is not
let 's get ready for the next appointment
uh no i 'm confidence and self worth ?
i don 't know if this is your idea of a joke but it 's not funny
it 's not a joke
i UNknown l show you the way out
blair uh i don 't know what you 'r e doing here but whatever it is it 's not gonna work
she totally humiliated me and destroyed my collection
little j having a fashion emergency
before you say anything i 'm only calling because i saw gossip girl
i wondered if i might be able to offer some assistance
well unless it 's a murder suicide
you should be a writer
tim UNknown is being honored at the observer 's new UNknown of the year party tonight at the boom boom room
why don 't you two accompany me ?
surely jenny can find a quiet moment to plead her case
and why should i actually believe that you 'r e trying to help us here ?
it would be my way of making amends to jenny
why don 't you run it by the brains of the operation ?
i can 't imagine her wanting blair to win this one
chuck can get us into the observer party and tim UNknown 's gonna be there
well it 's not like blair can do anything worse to me
but what about dinner with dad ?
i UNknown l leave tickets for the whole family
i look forward to seeing you at the festivities
queen b doesn 't grant second chances
she attacks at first sight
maybe we should walk in separately
i talked to my mom today and she 's so proud of me for taking your class
i don 't want her to read that i 'm dropping it in the new york times
well why don 't you just tell her ?
because she UNknown l think
i 'm choosing a man over my future again
oh thank you both for coming
are you sure this is a good idea ?
i mean r i s d
has a great fashion program
i i have a blair shaped target on my back
oh you want to be UNknown ?
let 's go find tim UNknown
what happened to chili night ?
i recognize him from his jacket photo which incidentally does not do him any justice
i know how important it is to you that i take his class oh it 's not the class i care about
i am just so proud of the student you 'r e becoming your new focus
serena i ducked the press line
lily humphrey formerly van der UNknown
jenny didn 't get on the train
she 's at the observer party
this isn 't just UNknown
why would she risk UNknown my wrath ?
don 't let her out of your sight
i 'm on my way
well the boom boom room is a private club and we 'r e having trouble with the door guy
all on a go see see who you like who you 'd like to have through the line and um if that works out for you we could
i it 's a long story
i really needed you to know that that 's not who i am or what my work 's about
and i would really do anything for a second chance
i think i can arrange for another interview
you know when veronica told me that chuck bass wanted us to meet wait
i know this sounds a little crazy but after our talk this morning
i thought maybe your brother was an inmate and you were just too embarrassed to tell me so i called over there
you called the prison ?
yeah and i 'm sorry
i was just being paranoid and it 's not an excuse but i have a history of believing girls when i shouldn 't
that 's why i came over
there are some things that i need to tell you about me and and my family
i UNknown l come right over
it is wonderful to see you
so good to see you
i saw you walk away from tim UNknown
just like old times huh j ?
what are you guys doing here ?
question is what are you doing here ?
or do you want that dress messed up too ?
we don 't make the rules j
you guys don 't know why blair hates me ?
you 'r e in trouble now
jenny whatever you 'r e thinking of doing they won 't stop
i have a humphrey to squash
looking to paint the town red ?
you UNknown e been behind this the whole time haven 't you ?
you got jenny the interview with tim UNknown and you made sure that your friend with no benefits stopped by the empire just to defy me
i told you i wouldn 't rest until you were destroyed
inviting your old UNknown partner back was just my way of avoiding doing all the dirty work myself
jenny always had a talent for making your life a living hell
you UNknown e gone too far
bringing jenny back puts both of our reputations at risk
i love to watch you squirm
the pleasure i get from UNknown your shame is considerable
but i doubt jenny will talk
she thinks she 's above it all but little humphrey still cares what people think
looks like new york 's best kept secret is finally out
turns out little j didn 't lose her v card to UNknown UNknown
she waited and chucked it away with her UNknown
guess that explains the humphrey in hudson
hell hath no fury like a waldorf scorned
it 's obviously not true
jenny put out the blast so that
tell them that she 's lying
everyone knows i did and who i gave it to
i 'm not quite sure what just happened in there but it it uh seems all bad
it 's a matter of degree
i mean i 'm a little embarrassed that the entire world knows
i lost it to chuck bass
but did you see their faces ?
i mean blair looked like she might cry
well so much for zen jenny humphrey
i just did what needed to be done
i met colin before he started teaching but i 'm gonna drop his class monday so there aren 't any further problems
oh serena please you don 't need to apologize
you 'r e not mad at me ?
well i understand the lure of a powerful man like colin
i married bart bass remember ?
and to be honest they can make your life so much easier
well it 's not about that
well we both know you would have moved on to classes more your speed eventually
you don 't think i could UNknown e handled a business class ?
well we UNknown l never know now will we ?
darling i 'm just trying to be UNknown and realistic
a pretty girl like you could get the attention of a colin forrester even without an education
so why even bother ?
lil i think you may have taken this tough love a little too literally this time
well um after serena left this afternoon
i bought colin 's book and on chapter 16 it talks about reverse psychology
i was reading in the library one minute and the next minute somebody was taking batting practice with a dictionary
do you know who it was ?
do you have a problem with someone ?
i 'm still on the wagon
i told UNknown m nothing stronger than a UNknown
i 'm sure if she knew how bad it was she would come down
i gave up on your mother visiting a long time ago
this wasn 't exactly what she signed up for
yeah well whatever happened to in good times and bad ?
i spent most of our marriage focused on for richer or poorer
i just wish she could see how great you 'r e doing now
now you can see it
that 's enough for now
nothing i can do about the rest till i get parole
well just try and stay safe until then
tell me again about that girl you like
thank you UNknown and thank you UNknown for marrying UNknown and giving someone else the chance to win bachelor this year
this is quite an honor but one i would gladly give up for the right woman
if i 'm ever lucky enough to meet her
anyway um thank you all
are you happy now that you UNknown e humiliated both of us ?
check your own bloody hands lady macbeth
what did you think would happen when you played carrie with her dresses ?
i only did it because you lured her back here to torture me
i warned you i wouldn 't stop
and thanks to your UNknown we both lost and jenny humphrey won
if you UNknown e come to gloat i would relish the moment
you 'r e right because i 'm leaving
despite what happened today i can 't beat you
in order to beat you i 'd have to become you and i 'm better than that
at least i wanna be
we know that you 'r e just scared and trying to save face
you two used to be in love and together you were invincible
but now that you UNknown e turned against each other it 's just a matter of time before your mutual destruction
and when that happens maybe i UNknown l think about coming home but for now good bye good riddance and good luck
hey what are you doing here ?
i was just gonna leave a note under your door
i thought you 'd be out celebrating your UNknown putting a new girl into a cab
you got me thinking if my class is so important to you maybe i should try a little harder to make it worth your while
fewer models and martinis more UNknown and UNknown
i know you need to figure out what you wanna do with your life serena
and if my course can help that 's great
we can still get to know each other
i 'm willing to wait if you are
well then teacher i UNknown l see you monday
and don 't even think about leaving an apple on my desk
you UNknown e got no shot at being teacher 's pet
seriously dan you don 't have to ride with me all the way to the border
pretty sure i 'm safe now
besides i 'm leaving like blair wanted
no no i 'm not guarding you
i 'm just uh just hanging out
although i don 't know if i 'm ever gonna be able to come back to the upper east side without UNknown into everything i hate about myself
oh give it some time
let your brooklyn d n a guide you to righteousness
thanks for being a good brother
they say war 's not the answer
but sometimes it 's a battle just to keep the peace
if you 'r e here to deliver any further humiliation
UNknown can sign for it
if we keep going we both end up dead and i like myself too much to let that happen
i assume you feel the same
why don 't you just UNknown the word double cross ?
it 'd be more subtle
look we can keep blaming each other for what happened that night or we can admit a harder truth it was no one 's fault
if serena hadn 't kissed dan then
nate wouldn 't have been at the hospital looking for her and jenny wouldn 't have come looking for nate
if UNknown hadn 't gone into labor
maybe everything would be different
we 'r e holding on to the pain because it 's all we have left
but we don 't have to
you can see yourself out
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that 's all right
because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i can 't tell you what it really is
i can only tell you what it feels like and right now
on the upper east side you may stand down but you can never give up
can you come over ?
i don 't think so
my dad 's gonna be okay
i 'm glad but nate
oh god this is so hard
okay well let me make it easy for you
you find out that nate archibald 's dad 's a jailbird and you decide you can do better or maybe you already have
nate please you 'r e different than anyone i UNknown e ever known
no you know what ?
just save it okay ?
cause you 'r e exactly like everyone i UNknown e ever known
i 'm so sorry but i have to go
i could use one too
i love the way you lie
i assume you are here for your check and not just to raid my liquor cabinet
i 'm sorry to be so UNknown
when it comes to love you 'r e just as blinded
how 's it going ?
you weren 't kidding when you said it 'd be a challenge
well all good things are worth waiting for aren 't they ?
in my voice when i talk gonna stand there and
so if you want peace always be prepared for war
well UNknown very busy eyes worth ?
house of UNknown and all that ?
rather a grind eh ?
few can take it seriously
the work has to be done your grace
one does what is expected of one if that 's what you mean
you sit in the UNknown in my UNknown and i sit here entertaining half the UNknown in london
hah and the country thinks it 's getting its money 's worth and let 's the thing go on
there 's no pleasure in doing all this you know as you UNknown l find out when it 's your turn
i don 't believe you do
too wrapped up in all those UNknown black books of yours
umm what the my most deuce color the books are
the important thing is that there should be a UNknown sitting in the house as a UNknown
there 's always been a UNknown with the UNknown
and now it 's your turn
and they tell me you are making a very nice stride
i UNknown e told UNknown that from now on your account is to see to be UNknown with an extra three thousand a year
and of course when you get married to the right kind of girl you can rely on me to see that everything 's arranged UNknown enough
your grace is very good
i 'm glad to see you here
who 's that leaving the pavilion ?
have you never seen him before UNknown ?
UNknown pal is the duke 's nephew
and also his heir not that he makes much of it
he 's a dedicated house of UNknown man UNknown is
so it follows that he don 't much care about being a duke
um he looks a very know what it means when the time comes all the same
oh he 's got a certain air about him all right has UNknown
but he doesn 't set himself up like other men would in his place
except when he 's saying his piece in the UNknown he keeps himself to himself
and like his uncle i wonder why the duke never married
well they do say that he lives in such style that he can 't afford it too
but if you ask me george he just never fancied being tied up
oh he likes the ladies all right but he 's well enough suited without them
yes has he married yet ?
he 's never look at a woman since they let him out of the nursery
well he 's looking at one now dolly
the fair girl over there on the bridge
he 's bearing down on her like a battleship
you know who she is of course ?
a clergyman 's down from the country
she 's as dull as she 's long and cold as a cod
what ever is UNknown pal thinking of ?
nothing very much i could say
you saw the way he went after her positively sweeping people from his path
but now that he 's there dolly his behavior is not exactly passionate
you don 't understand UNknown for UNknown pal to go within
you UNknown e been with the dear duke of UNknown this afternoon mr UNknown
how did you find his grace ?
i think i may say uh gracious
there are very few men like you luther
you UNknown e uh been in the house lately mr UNknown ?
i go everyday lady UNknown
oh you were so fascinating about it last time you went
the weights measures and UNknown act we were discussing
why yes yes indeed it was
would it interest you lady UNknown to to hear more about it ?
the unit of measure that we employ is irregular being adapted to popular use and a system of UNknown it would disgrace a UNknown of black savages
oh how very UNknown you put it mr UNknown
20 shillings in the pound ; 21 in the guinea ; 12 pennies in a shilling ; 12 UNknown in a penny
i i tell you lady UNknown it 's a scandal in its human intellect
tell me adelaide how long has lady UNknown been married ?
why do you ask charlotte ?
ohh she seems rather to fancy young mr UNknown
she was very strictly brought up you know
and as for mr UNknown huh he 's entirely respectable
no man is entirely respectable
ah i see the duke has noticed it
he won 't like it very much
but i hardly think it would be notice
kindly find out over the next few days whether my nephew is in the habit of seeing lady UNknown
get the orchestra started and let them all dance if that 's what they want
i UNknown l sit out a pair of waltzes and then i UNknown l go in
his grace wishes the dancing to UNknown
well if the duke don 't like his nephew going about with lady UNknown you can be quite sure that he UNknown l stop it quick enough
well that 's the duke 's concern adelaide
orchestra continues to play on
i could have sworn UNknown was all right
she was playing croquet with lord and lady UNknown
well she ain 't playing croquet now !
smile him bug UNknown m
that 's enough of that they
there 's nothing you can do about it
charlotte but sit quietly and behave as though nothing were happening
UNknown kisses UNknown on the cheek
my god what a lovely girl
ohh so you remember UNknown do you ?
but who 's the girl dolly ?
that is the lady UNknown mccluskey
the only daughter and the only child of the late lord of the isles
her mother is dead now so she 's an orphan
she 's worth a queen 's mint in money
she 's only been out a few months
and already UNknown fitzgerald has his hooks in
some say that he is very fond of her in his way
and she certainly likes the cut of him
but there 's a great big black fly in that ointment
she 's got a guardian the marquis of auld UNknown
he don 't count for much if i remember rightly
but his wife counts for more than a dozen and she 'd sooner that UNknown married the devil rather than UNknown fitzgerald
that 's her behind that weeping elm
the one that looks like a toad on a UNknown
there ain 't much chance for UNknown fitzgerald while she sits there watching
who 's the old UNknown with her ?
that is the countess of UNknown
she takes an occasional shift when the old toad starts UNknown
twenty four hour picket you see
i i cannot i i will not allow her !
she owns four counties ten houses and furthermore she descended from robert de bruce
and mr fitzgerald as she informed me only the other day
from the wrong side of a great many blankets they say
he drinks like a UNknown and lost all his money on horses
and she 's been following him about with stars in her eyes ever since you brought her down from scotland
it must be done adelaide
ah ! and now you have
oh keep thinking adelaide keep thinking
seems to have UNknown very well
those sort of people always do
some say that his aunt
lady monk does it for him
some say that it 's one of the UNknown
but if you ask me george his best friends are the jews
so either way the uh the rich little mccluskey would suit him down to the ground
which brings me to another point
the commercial advantages of any
are you going to take a turn on the floor ?
it 's not quite my line
ah but it may be lady UNknown 's
is it you line ?
i was just listening to mr UNknown
so that 's why you both to be so UNknown
but UNknown why do you never have such fascinating things to tell me as mr UNknown tells lady UNknown
excuse me mr UNknown but at last i see lord UNknown
i wonder which one of those two is the more boring
mr UNknown i should think
he knows so much more to be boring about
now why didn 't we think of him before ?
he can 't be meaning to go off with lady UNknown
oh he 's so right for UNknown
ha ha ha and the money 's right
and what is more charlotte
UNknown needs someone to respect
someone to simmer her down
lady UNknown and lady auld UNknown
we have come to you with a proposal which we think might suit you
quite the round as it will suit us
in brief duke my ward lady UNknown mccluskey and your nephew mr UNknown UNknown
have you spoken to the lady UNknown about it ?
no but we soon shall if your grace is of a mind with us
well they tell me that she 's a young lady who likes her own way
oh but what young lady does not
UNknown must learn to put her duty before her preference
i UNknown e not doubt of that
i have given your proposal my full consideration
and i find that it will do
tell me george what did you actually do out there in the colonies ?
and now you UNknown e come home to enjoy it
it depends on what you mean by enjoyment dolly
i mean to go into parliament
well your own grandfather up in UNknown won 't approve of that
after all he refused to shell out for you for a seat before you went away
uh huh that 's why i went away
but now i UNknown e got a bit of my own money dolly and i intend to spend it as i please and be damned of my own grandfather
that 's all very well george but he might UNknown you
the UNknown estate must come to me
and you 'r e uncle 's still alive ?
while we 'r e discussing my family dolly there 's something you may know that i don 't
do you remember my cousin alice ?
do you know anything about him ?
made your pile i suppose ?
everyone seems to suppose that
george is going into parliament just to annoy his grandfather at UNknown hall
i just might have more serious motives dolly
they want a bit of movement and uh they won 't get it with the sitting member
i 'm going to put up against him at the general election
it 's too late old boy
his father is near dead of the whiskeys
so if the house of lords would value by him in a bye election in the chelsea district
bye elections can come expensive in london and i 'd have it all to do again at the general election
well you can manage that old man after all the loot that you brought home from the colonies
you should have gone with him UNknown
some of it might have rubbed off on you
my time may come sooner than you think
i think UNknown that the time has come for some supper
you must have heard how it is with me and UNknown mccluskey
well the thing is you can help me
well she 's a sort of cousin of UNknown 's on her mother 's side
well i have to be
those horrible old women hanging around UNknown with their fangs UNknown make it awfully hard for us to meet
i warn you UNknown my cousin alice though a spirited girl is very UNknown UNknown
might do alice good to see a bit of the smart set
and i UNknown l get word to UNknown
let me say it plainly and for the last time UNknown
you can not receive mr fitzgerald in this house
because he ain 't suitable !
because he 's a drunkard and bankrupt and something else which delicacy forbids me to say
you marry that UNknown fitzgerald missy and he UNknown l gamble away everything you UNknown e got and then beat you when it 's gone
well he ain 't setting a foot in your aunt 's house and that 's that
it 's a lovely day and i may through walk in the park
you 'r e not going to meet that man !
don 't worry aunt according to your idea that he 's lying in bed full of brandy and won 't get up till dinner
i 'm a free woman now and i can go where i want
you UNknown l take your maid missy
ah good of you to come so promptly UNknown
i i want to say a word or two in season
the fact is people have been talking about you and lady UNknown
upon my word people are very kind
kind enough are they not ?
but you have i think been seen much in her company
now see here UNknown the fact is that for many years
i have been very intimate with their family
and at one time with none more intimate then with lady UNknown
duke i can 't cheat
say it or not as you choose
but you should remember that UNknown
i have given much and asked nothing
in this matter i expect to be obliged
if you are looking for someone to spend your time with you could do a lot worse than that little UNknown mccluskey
caw come to that you 'r e other baggage is just plain stupid
ha ha you UNknown l find little mccluskey understands politics well enough
lady UNknown the problem is this
how could a man eh a politician that is better said remain independent and UNknown ?
if he 's a member of the UNknown
if he takes office under the government receives a handsome UNknown for so doing
well then he must trim his opinions in accord with those of his masters
if a man wishes to rise in the world well he must accept such conditions
there are some things lady UNknown for which the world might well be lost
this meeting can 't be long
that maid 's going to speak to my aunt
i can 't believe i met you by accident
UNknown it was no accident
i was waiting for you outside lady auld UNknown 's house
when i saw you come out i followed you and cut you off
UNknown we must have somewhere to meet properly
now listen do you know a cousin of yours called alice UNknown ?
the one that looks like a policeman ?
i hardly ever see her
well start seeing her now
go to her everyday until it becomes a matter of course
the old ladies will like it because she 's engaged to be married to john grey the UNknown man in england and properly respectable
we won 't have much fun
oh yes you will when the other cousin starts arriving
george UNknown bringing me with him
and you UNknown l see that will become a matter of course
and that mr UNknown is everything i think
oh thank you mr UNknown
mr UNknown i hope you UNknown l excuse me but
i wonder you don 't think of marrying
i hope you UNknown l excuse me mr UNknown i do indeed but
i tender the suggestion because i am half afraid of some some UNknown of good feeling between you and your uncle
i was not aware of any such probability
i trust there is none but the duke is a very determined man if he takes anything into his head
and then you know he has so much in his power
well he has not me in his power mr UNknown
oh no no no one man does not have another in his power in this country mr UNknown
but only think if he should take offense what one word of his might do
so it would hardly do to offend him
i would rather not offend him mr UNknown certainly
but his grace has indicated that he wishes you not to keep company with a certain party whom we need not name
now the trouble is mr UNknown you ain 't stop seeing that certain party now have you ?
will you excuse me mr UNknown ?
because if once you was married mr UNknown his grace will come down handsome as a king
you UNknown e understood what i UNknown e been saying ?
then you realize perhaps what i 'm leading up to
of the climax to which i am now coming ?
now if matters could be arranged as i have been suggesting to you
but they surely can be mr UNknown
well then we should be able to achieve everything we desire
by the simple UNknown of having ten pennies in every shilling
he doesn 't want to see me cousin alice
all the same cousin george since you are to be his heir
it might be tactful to go up to UNknown hall and pay him a little attention
but kate 's up there
she UNknown l look after my interests with old squire UNknown
kate may be a very loyal sister to you but she won 't be able to guard your interests if she isn 't there
what do you mean not there ?
haven 't you heard george ?
kate and my father and i are going to switzerland for a twelve week tour
we leave at the end of next month
no i hadn 't heard
it was arranged before you came back
i 'm not sure it suits me
kate leaving the old man for 12 weeks
then you UNknown l have to be UNknown
kate needs a change george and a change she 's going to have
a wretched dull place switzerland
where are you going ?
no use looking like that george
i broke it off with you for excellent reasons which you very well remember
and i 'm not obliged to remain a spinster all my life in your memory
mr grey is a scholar and a gentleman
will be a husband whom i can love and trust
they tell me he 's a damned dull dog
if you 'r e going to talk like that george i think you 'd better leave
but i UNknown l come again soon alice
huh huh i very much hope so
i UNknown l bring a friend with me if i may
my old chum UNknown fitzgerald
hmm he 's heard you UNknown e a strong character and as he 's as loose as jam himself he 's hoping you UNknown l teach him your secret
and a very good morning to you UNknown
i don 't think you UNknown e met old friend lady UNknown
but you are of course acquainted with her daughter in law lady UNknown
i expect you 'd like to tell my nephew what i UNknown e just been telling you
then we can all understand one another
that we can 't be allowed
and the duke says that in view of our UNknown positions it does seem so very foolish for us to and i mean
she means UNknown that she is called a countess and one day she UNknown l be a UNknown which is good enough going for any lady in the land
even for one as beautiful as she is
uh so there 's no point in upsetting UNknown and tossing away the whole thing
true as my nephew you stand to be a duke one day
but as to that sir no one need think
i 'm too old to marry and get a few sons if it suits me
lady UNknown has done me the goodness to see the force of my arguments
your servant ma 'a m
fetch her ladyship 's carriage
you see my dear boy she never really wanted you
and you don 't really want her
all this billing and cooing just isn 't your style
now do as i ask you there 's a good fellow
and everything will go as neat and steady as the clock
three words will do the trick
alice how very good to see you
after so long lady UNknown
oh don 't be unkind
well i waited and waited for you to come to me and then when you didn 't i said to myself
and then at last i said to myself
well if the mountain won 't come to mohammed
yes and with a thousand questions
but uh first of all
mr grey is a learned man of several habits
i like a quiet life lady UNknown
so everything has turned out very conveniently except for poor mr george UNknown
mr george UNknown was to blame for that
but you still see him though ?
he UNknown l be coming here this afternoon i think
and mr fitzgerald with him ?
why do you mention mr fitzgerald lady UNknown ?
well i mean that is it seems they are very much together
mr george UNknown 's here ma 'a m with mr fitzgerald
you will tell them that i cannot receive mr fitzgerald
please alice i bid you just this one time
alice what the devil 's going on ?
nothing is going on mr UNknown
you may come here if you will and you may bring your friends if you wish
but i will not have this house used as a place of UNknown
heartless for just this once was all i asked
why should i not see him ?
why should i not marry him ?
i don 't know even why you should not marry mr fitzgerald
but something is badly amiss lady UNknown if you must meet him by UNknown in the house of a distant cousin
in the house of a friend
alice how can i bribe you ?
alice next to him i will love you better than all the world
i cannot do as you ask
you 'r e heartless !
you you have never loved !
well then why will you not understand ?
i understand but for a woman to give her love to a certain kind of man is UNknown
i 'm sorry for you
i know what it means to reject love
but you have the strength to do it
but you may always come
and even if he didn 't ruin you
no one would know you
the queen would not receive you
and your children would be
worse than nameless bearing his name
the old duke will be very generous with money
i am rich in my own rights
mr UNknown will not waste your achievements
then one day the old duke will die
and you will be a duchess
the lady UNknown is enough
mr UNknown is much concerned with politics
but mr UNknown 's political interests need not disturb you my dear
they will keep him out of the house so to speak
so you will have plenty of leisure for your own chosen UNknown
poetry and uh that kind of a thing
mr UNknown is a very gentle very innocent man
not given to worldly manners
imagining others to be as innocent as he
and so knowing nothing of the realities which lie behind the poetry books
of which you dear UNknown are so fond
crows cawing ; birds singing
our friends say we may do very well together
can it be so ?
can it be so lady UNknown ?
if you wish it mr UNknown
there is one thing that you must know
there has been another life and i loved him
you must love me now
match inquiry with the whole estate and all its UNknown shall be handed over to you at once
the family jewels are of course at her complete disposal
and i am sending her a carriage and six pairs of horses
those are small a memento of this auspicious engagement
UNknown has been instructed to place substantial amounts of railway and mining stock in your name
and above all this you will be paid an annual allowance such as UNknown a married gentleman who is my UNknown heir
your grace is extremely generous sir
i do have one UNknown is that material UNknown alone do not necessarily make for a happy marriage
there are other things to consider
indeed there are but you UNknown e nothing to worry about that there she 's a nice enough little girl and wink very appetizing with it
what more can you ask ?
we are talking about marriage UNknown
well the two are sometimes talked about in UNknown
well see here UNknown UNknown may marry for love if they choose but when UNknown marry they marry for more important reasons
and UNknown are still flesh and blood your grace
you and the little mccluskey can UNknown to suit each other i suppose
well we can 't know that in duke
well you must UNknown to suit each other at any rate until there 's a son
two to be on the safe side
you UNknown l find as many bored wives to amuse you after you 'r e married as you ever did before
uh uh but just see to it that there 's no open scandal
ho ho when i was a boy it didn 't really matter much
although some reason it does now
there will be no scandal duke
because there will be no cause
if you will your grace i know that you have never taken marriage vows
but you must know that they UNknown fidelity
and they are vows to be sworn and kept
well you do as you like about that
in any case i 'm very well pleased both with you and this arrangement
and the sooner the day the better
alice alice they 'r e forcing me to marry mr UNknown
they UNknown e just been tormenting me until i couldn 't bear it anymore
and they 'r e forcing me to marry him !

mr churchill is a long way from shreds
i 'd like to know how many of his ships are getting through
while we sit on our UNknown waiting for orders
where are they herr UNknown ?
the british have plenty of them
nothing but hot air all of them
it UNknown l make exciting reading in your epic
the propaganda ministry will love it

the UNknown song if you have no objections
that stuff makes me puke
now we 'r e in the royal navy
a record won 't make you into the king of england
shut the door you lazy pig !
they should use him as a UNknown his rear end 's big enough
sweaty feet and hair grease
smells just like old socks these rotten eggs
we could fatten them up with jam from your filthy feet
they 'd have good fun feeding on UNknown 's toe jam
intellectual starvation i would say
it could just about do it

it UNknown that the inner man is wholesome and upstanding
an officer should be UNknown in his dress and UNknown
in the old days young officers were treated UNknown in this
knowing they risked their lives their superiors
we 'r e in clover here
they 'r e rolling in clover too
they 'r e even allowed to smoke
dived to evade enemy aircraft
the british have stopped making mistakes
cut off extra supply of fuel to the engines !
torpedo rooms check the UNknown angles

u 32 has spotted a british convoy
we should be there in 10 hours
u 32 is operating against a convoy
we are joining in the hunt
contact expected any time after 18 00 hours
these beauties are ready for blast off
UNknown is waiting for us to arrive
he 's following the convoy
for me it 's the best thrill with u boats and sailing ships
holds as big as churches
we could pass the british completely without seeing them
we should be within range
why doesn 't UNknown signal us ?
why haven 't we heard from h q ?
take her down 30 metres
take her down 30 metres
why are we diving ?
in bad weather you can hear more than you can see on the surface
note this in our log book
despite bad weather commencing operation

how does it look ?
the enemy should be here
freighter on the starboard bow

flood tubes one to four
flood tubes one to four

i UNknown e already started
we UNknown e waited over an hour now
i guess we have shaken them off
don 't be too sure
he could have stopped and be waiting
to surprise us when we surface
when it 's dark we UNknown l surface
what 's it like up top ?
go up to 30 metres
all this damn noise !
i UNknown e got bad news men
what 's up now ?
not a chance of making the finals now
it can 't be !
i don 't believe it !
a whole army of them
they UNknown l eat your UNknown down to the bone
give him a go with gun powder !
this meat needs a shave
you 'd better see the medic
crabs by the look of them
when the creatures begin to surface it 's the fifth stage
get it all in the torpedo room
you two give me a hand
bosun do you know where the medic is ?
yeah in the bow compartment
have you gone crazy ?
have you heard the latest ?
our UNknown is tying the knot
half the fleet have tried her
they should stick you in a zoo with a chimpanzee
here 's the pictures of her !
you dirty rotten swine !
don 't tell me this hag lets you sleep with her
these boats are built to take it
you should try a sailing ship
she 's UNknown to starboard
i can 't keep on course
we 'r e burning up fuel for nothing
stand by all main vents
nothing exciting out there ?
position reports and very faint sos calls from enemy UNknown
when the rudder breaks on one of those old UNknown
there 's nothing to do but pray
the sea can 't sink us UNknown
put the record on again
i UNknown e got him
bring the first aid kit damn it !
self discipline is the only road to military leadership
three ribs cracked and a gash on the head
UNknown is good for you

anything that grows on this boat we UNknown e got to be grateful for
it 's been years since i saw snow
captain u boat on port bow
it 's one of ours
a german u boat !
good hunting you old rascal !
so they pushed you out to sea again
how can this happen ?
how can this happen ?
12 boats we UNknown e got on the atlantic from UNknown to the UNknown
have you checked on our position ?
more or less is not good enough !
we UNknown e not had a sun shot in 14 days
we UNknown e been drifting in this storm
it 's hard to UNknown
if we make an error in our position and the others do the same
we end up playing collision games
the route is wide open
another story in the middle of the ocean lieutenant
i hope you 'r e making notes
maybe headquarters will listen to you
you UNknown e more influence than i have
so you believe that ?
have you got your flashlight ready ?
it 's bound to be a false alarm
they could be off chasing one of ours
do we risk it ?
it 's worth a try captain
UNknown what 's your feeling ?

what about the torpedoes ?
those torpedoes don 't run true
it was crazy to attack like that
that destroy won 't let us go
he UNknown l try and hunt us down
now they are going to the bottom
now we have the payoff
both engines ahead two thirds
both engines ahead two thirds
they 'r e astern of us way astern of us
they 'r e spitting in the wrong direction
we haven 't thrown them off yet
i reckon they won 't be too happy
both engines ahead one third
both engines ahead one third
now we UNknown l see
the filthy rotten swine !
what 's the damage ?
let 's get the hell out of here !
one of the valves is fractured !
we 'r e on fire !

he is near his mark
the foundation bolts are loose !
i want accurate damage reports
water 's pouring in !
the engine room is leaking water !
i UNknown l go and take a look

don 't disobey my orders
do as you 'r e told !
we 'r e sinking !
we 'r e sinking !
make a note for the war diary
stayed UNknown for six hours at silent speed
satisfied the destroyers have lost us
intense glow in sky observed at 210 degrees
probably flames from the tanker we hit
we UNknown l surface in ten minutes
first watch stand by for duty
you see lieutenant they didn 't kill us
her back 's already broken
she is a tough one
she won 't go down
let 's finish her off
number one tube is flooded
why didn 't their own ships rescue them ?
they UNknown e had six hours
they 'r e swimming towards us
both engines back two thirds
we can 't take prisoners
may i clear the table sir ?
UNknown is on the same convoy
UNknown UNknown a 6 000 UNknown
they 'r e having a field day
a minimum of five hours away at full speed
we can 't make it
sir when do we go back ?
when it 's time for us to go back and not before UNknown
crew was still on board
there 's nothing to be said
you deserted your post at a critical moment and disobeyed a direct order
you mean to say that there has to be a court martial ?
it won 't ever happen again sir
then there 's no court martial ?
have you found the problem ?
it 's the bulkhead UNknown
there 's a signal to be UNknown
suppose it 's top secret
they 'r e not much use to us
this relic needs a UNknown
on the fuel we UNknown e got we won 't even make la rochelle
we UNknown l hoist a sail
real girls in christmas stockings
sexy little nurses to comfort and kiss
we UNknown l have a ball !
a UNknown big and fat
we have a new destination
la UNknown naval base in ltaly
we UNknown l pick up fuel and supplies at UNknown in spain
there goes our christmas stocking
i 'd like to kill those morons !
we UNknown l have christmas in ltaly
we UNknown e got to get there first !
it 's like the eye of a needle
it 's the best chance to get ourselves killed
i UNknown e already made the decision
i UNknown e got to find a replacement for the chief
our agents will smuggle you out of spain somehow
dressed up as gypsies for instance
it 's easier to get two of you out
i really believe the chief needs a break
his wife is very ill
when we reach UNknown it 's goodbye
the captain 's ordered me ashore
there 's quite a bunch of them here
help me out with the gear
she 's got herself UNknown here
with torpedoes fuel and supplies
three cheers for our UNknown u boat men
i 'm delighted to be so honoured
gentlemen here they stand our heroes of the deep
our humble ship is honoured
what a nice clean UNknown
we UNknown e done what we can for you
i hope it 's to your taste
sausage our chef 's specialty
we 'r e waiting to hear your news
you can 't imagine what it means to us
it isn 't easy here
sure there 's plenty to eat
torpedoes are very tricky though but you 'r e all set up
how many ship have you sunk ?
to the german u boat service and out beloved fuhrer
we 'r e not exactly at home if you understand what i mean
there 's plenty for everyone
let 's get down to business
tell us all about it captain
i 'm bursting with curiosity
you see gentlemen that 's the stuff heroes are made of
phenomenal that 's what it is
i want to hear more captain
the chef 's mother 's own recipe
so what 's it like to be under water
while overhead the enemy lies in wait ?
just as long as no one UNknown
i can explain what he means
we 'r e often running at silent speed
and that 's why you can 't UNknown !
the men from madrid are here
UNknown we UNknown e been expecting you
the representative of our naval UNknown here
i have some communications from berlin
first the documents for the breakthrough
we are going for a little fresh air
our request has been denied chief
you UNknown l stay too werner
i guess it 's just as well
who knows what kind of idiot they 'd have sent you
one of those new found warriors who 's all wind and smoke
they could have sent us some UNknown
that 's all we 'd need
get that chart table cleared
i can 't navigate on bananas
what do you think you 'r e doing ?
get that fruit out of here
is that a christmas tree ?
no camouflage for the bridge
they won 't replace us
7 miles from coast to coast
7 miles from coast to coast
these are the only british UNknown in the western UNknown
they are very heavily defended
the place will be crawling with patrol boats
anything that floats will be on the water
this is where we have to go
we move in under darkness
we UNknown l see if we can slip through
as near to gibraltar as we can get
then dive down and let ourselves drift through
and so dive and let the surface current pull us through the UNknown
it 's an easy trick
quiet as a shadow and we burn less fuel
right let 's get going
the navigator and i stay up here
half the british fleet is out there
it 's very kind of the enemy to show their navigation lights
no she 's heading away
all engines indicate ahead full
engines indicate ahead two thirds
ready to abandon ship !
where 's the escape gear ?
out of the way !
the port engine belt is loose
maintain full power chief !
all the power you UNknown e got !
bow planes out of action !
the bow plane has jammed on dive
auxiliary pump out of action
she 's still going down
we UNknown e got to shed some weight
main pump out of action !
all you UNknown e got chief !
lord turn not away from me
take away all our sins
a shovel full of sand
the gods left a shovel full of sand to keep us up
280 metres and she 's still in one piece !
torpedo hatch taking water !
torpedo hatch taking water !
we 'r e taking water !
what do you need ?
where are the tools ?
where are you going ?
give me proper damage reports !
we can 't stop the flooding
with so much damage we UNknown e had it
push as hard as you can
i can 't wedge it
do you need more men aft ?
i UNknown l ask the lieutenant
you stupid son of a pig !
we UNknown e got work to do !
tools from the engine room
where 's that damn wrench ?
it just keeps rising !
don 't UNknown the bolts
the cooling system is leaking
tighten the seals down there
it 's flooded down here
get me the biggest one
captain the chief 's looking for you
we 'r e taking water fast
the cooling UNknown is blocked
what about fuel leaks ?
i can 't tell as yet
see how many cells have cracked
get that out of the way
the chief needs battery straps make it quick !
it 's still coming in
tell the chief the water is up to the torpedo hatch and rising
who 's working on those shaft seals
tell them to hurry up
let 's hope these are enough
our only chance is to bridge all the live cells
we UNknown e got to close the leaks or it 's all over for us
i need wire to bridge them
wire for the battery cells
did you hear me ?
we UNknown e got plenty of fancy torpedoes
each one is 25 000 marks
all they forget is 50 UNknown worth of old wire !
the draining pump is jammed
now change your wet things man
we must get rid of the water
there just has to be a way
into the control room bilge and then outside
get a move on boys
put your backs into it
how does it look ?
only three to go sir
make some room for the chief
take the men off watch
take the men off watch
captain all of our UNknown are out of action
we UNknown e lost the sounding gear
all radio contact is dead
can we get up again ?
a bit of air must still be in the ballast tanks from the blowing
we UNknown l use all the high pressure air we have left
the boat has to be lighter
we UNknown e got to get the water out
the ballast pump and the UNknown air could just force the water out
we 'r e fixing it
we gamble on one count
when the repairs are completed
ln about eight hours sir
all men not working turn in
will he pull through ?
it 's difficult to say
he doesn 't look too good
well pilgrim is everything okay ?
we 'r e getting it under control
i think we 'r e winning
how is it looking aft ?
we UNknown e done what we can sir
i guess it 's time i looked things over
can you make it ?
we UNknown l make it
how does it look ?
we UNknown l soon be running
how 's it going ?
do you want some UNknown ?
how about some apple juice ?
they were crazy ordering us through the UNknown
it was going to go wrong
the old man he knew it
from the moment that radio signal came through he realized the risk
that 's the reason he ordered us ashore
he knew there was very little hope
he tried to fool us
an easy trick he said
dive and drift with the current
but it has to work
will we ever get out of this ?
i really don 't know
you think it 's hopeless now ?
it 's been 15 hours
we UNknown l never do it
they made us all dream for this day
to be fearless and proud and alone
they told us it would be the test of our manhood
to need no one and UNknown all for the fatherland and courage
is that not the way they said it all ?
i just want someone to be with
the only thing i feel is afraid
the boat is in order
water in the UNknown tanks can be blown out with UNknown air
the compass is in order
go and take a rest now
just a few small problems left sir
you have to have good men
we 'r e going to blow out the water and try to get out of the sand
if we make it to the surface it could still get pretty rough
the traffic 's heavy up there
pray the engines start so we can get out of this mess
with the condition the boat is in we UNknown l head straight for la rochelle
if we make it it 's half a bottle of beer for each
there 's one thing on our side
they 'r e going !
i UNknown e never heard such sweet music in all my life
they 'r e running !
they won 't catch us this time
keep going and get us back
that 's an order !
jesus that 's good !
they haven 't spotted us
they 'r e snoring in their bunks
they 'r e drinking in the bar
not yet my friends !
boys here 's to home !
and an end to the war
let 's pray the engines hold out
with a bit of luck we UNknown l make it back home
a lot of people from that region long time ago been driven
UNknown UNknown slavery the people their rights had been
none to be able to
people for each of the UNknown important thing
sword of the most important war was one of the UNknown
and all the while the people UNknown lives
the existence of the universe since the people will always give something away

today you will die !
grow old with you sole purpose of
the extraordinary adventures of ad le blanc sec
ferdinand UNknown is a minor character in our story
nonetheless he is where this adventure begins as he wandered home after an evening spent playing cards and UNknown a marvellous 12 year old whisky
it was november 4th UNknown at 1 o UNknown lock in the morning
the streets were empty with a chilly nip in the air
yet at the same time exactly 953 metres from there the city was jumping
on stage nicole UNknown or nini the legs kicked up a storm
the enthusiastic audience UNknown in the show
every evening was a triumph
from the gent over there
and every evening for nearly a month
raymond UNknown a former prefect celebrated his promotion to paris as secretary of state for foreign affairs
meanwhile ferdinand had barely travelled the 280 metres that separate la UNknown from place des UNknown
don t be shy !
you UNknown e seen others !
ferdinand 's visions were in fact an optical illusion
the UNknown lights came from the home of professor marie joseph UNknown
this eminent scientist and expert on ancient egypt had obtained a degree in physics at age 16
his research UNknown 35 years later in a book with the UNknown title is there a life after death ?
at the same moment across the seine the question seemed to have been settled long ago
yet on the first floor a life form that UNknown the laws of science was about to give the scientist his answer
as the century 's most amazing experiment took place before our eyes
inspector albert UNknown had his tightly shut
of course had he seen the UNknown fly by his window our story would have been UNknown different but for now no one could blame the inspector for his UNknown
his UNknown and UNknown had previously earned him a good many UNknown including the medal of merit for solving the mystery of the missing persons of UNknown asylum
what are you doing ?
let my little bird land on your branches
as the night UNknown the dew in the branch prepares to fall
and the bird in the nest to open its eyes
drive normally can 't you ?
help me find the words
this young man is a scientist too but a humble assistant working at the UNknown gardens
his name is UNknown and he 's 23
science isn 't his only passion
what if she 's married ?
or even worse widowed ?
yes his second passion is unconditional love for miss ad le blanc sec
a passion she provoked with these few words
who 's it for ?
for UNknown bo bobo UNknown
UNknown with a UNknown as in jaguar
something you should know about ad le to really understand her
she listens to her instincts not her publisher
UNknown how many hours ride to the rendezvous ?
what 's move in arabic ?
you need to drink a lot of water in this heat
these are the two men i told you about
a cup of tea before the drop ?
do i look like i drink tea ?
it 's the embalming room where the mummies were prepared
the bodies were UNknown on the altar and the UNknown thrown in these pots
then after a quick wash they were powdered made up and dressed
what was this for ?
the body goes here and the machine wraps it in 200 layers of bandages
not to mention the oil UNknown between each layer
what kind of oil is it ?
no idea but it worked a treat
gents let 's see your treasure
death is the only path that leads to birth
your journey ends here darling
to thank you for your cooperation we UNknown l spare your life
a UNknown UNknown mix of oil and UNknown
enter with even a tiny match and there UNknown l be fireworks
after careful consideration we accept your application
allow me to save my emotion for later
that 's that bit done
where 'd you learn all this ?
there are only two ways
come on they 'r e down there !
even without the stone it 's very heavy
how will we ever get it out ?
opening a pharaoh s tomb is sacrilege
you can hang for that
i won 't leave without my gold !
i fear you re right
money can 't buy happiness UNknown
that 's your pharaoh ?
if it 's for a consultation miss you may be a bit late
however i know a specialist institute in cairo where the doctors would be delighted to examine you
i 'm fine thank you
except for the nausea i feel in your presence prof UNknown
still the same UNknown sense of humour my dear ad le
meanwhile tell me why a great reporter like you is here looting tombs
you re taking him for a walk to get some fresh air
UNknown is a professor of medicine
UNknown il 's personal doctor
would that be to cure UNknown ?
how very thoughtful and touching
but has it crossed your mind that your professor is dead ?
i 'd noticed thank you
how will you UNknown him ?
is there a life after death ?
that old fool UNknown ?
he 's barely able to spin a chair round
he UNknown l be dead before he UNknown this old mummy !
mummies hear everything we say and detest disrespect
you re scaring me !
after the ice monster here comes the sand zombie !
watch out he 's a real UNknown !
i confess i 'm one of your most UNknown readers but this is by far the silliest story you UNknown e ever told
it must be in the middle
foreigners are given more consideration and a swift death
a last wish perhaps ?
it 's not very good for my health but i 'd appreciate a cigarette
a gift i suppose ?
it 's better this way
whenever you use it think of me
forgive me the sudden intimacy
we 'r e nearly there
i UNknown l kill her !
i UNknown l kill her !
mr UNknown how can i believe a man with 50 alcohol on his breath ?
the bird UNknown onto the car and UNknown it to pieces !
and he had a UNknown clad woman next to him
a UNknown clad woman ?
i know but i saw her !
we UNknown e identified the dead
there were three passengers in the vehicle
what did i tell you ?
to the drunk tank !
it 's the big bird that did it !
i was just going home
gentlemen until we find out more about this tragedy
i 'm relying on you to keep this case confidential
the prefect and the UNknown !
their dance with death !
giant bird UNknown on the capital !
get the little parisian today !
giant bird UNknown on the capital !
giant bird UNknown on the capital !
read all about it !
they UNknown l do anything to sell their rag
even le UNknown has run it
it 's the talk of the town
send poor UNknown 's widow our condolences
a prefect with a UNknown perhaps
in the 20th century !
this UNknown business sounds serious
it could be UNknown up to their tricks
look into it and keep me informed
leave it to me sir
this UNknown business is dragging on
the president wants results this week
i UNknown l take care of it sir
hardly surprising it 's going nowhere !
give him 72 hours to obtain results
i 'm on the job sir
we have to solve this fast
i UNknown e put you on the UNknown case
don t let me down
our reputation s at stake
i UNknown l do my best sir
it wasn 't like that ?
this egg 's always been in my care
yesterday an attendant noticed broken glass
he blamed it on a careless visitor and simply replaced the glass
people are so clumsy !
it 's more complicated than that
look at the remains of the shell
most are still connected to the UNknown UNknown as if the force that cracked the egg came from
after 135 million years UNknown it emerged from its shell and flew away
in that case could it be related to the UNknown in the press ?
you d have made an excellent policeman
what can i do for you ?
that 's what i said
seeing the bone collection in your museum
i thought maybe you could help
i 'm strictly a UNknown man
i 'd suggest you see a specialist in the UNknown
look i have 24 hours to solve this
i can 't go visiting UNknown
let me find you a specialist in paris in that case
it 'd make a heck of an omelette
fetch me a black coffee and something to nibble on
i can 't think on an empty stomach
eat my baby eat !
i have some questions for you about the UNknown UNknown
i was told you re a specialist
but this isn 't a
i was about to eat
perfect that 's our speciality
well please come in then
goodness it 's dark in here
i 'm very sensitive to light
so how can i be of help ?
tell me about the animal
what it eats where it sleeps
we know very little about its habits
we do know it 's a UNknown
nothing beats a rare rib of beef !
it has a UNknown of about six metres and can fly for hours on end looking for food to take back to the nest
there 's a nest of them ?
but at their time when they had a mate finding food and building a nest were their main activities
mating took place once a year and for reasons as yet unknown they only laid one egg at a time
it 's because of the egg
it was too much for him
the man 's deranged !
my only hope of seeing you my dear as you travel far and near is if i lie in wait for you here
tell me my good man is this a cab or a b b ?
i 'd love to get moving lady but these damn UNknown are blocking the road
when will they ban horses from paris ?
you moron or you are dead !
where were we just now ?
what UNknown pocus have you brought back now ?
miranda mind your language and help with the bags
i just cleaned your room
you bring back these old dirty relics again
i UNknown l take care of this one personally
what 's all this mail ?
the young man from the UNknown gardens
a letter a day and two on monday to make up for sunday
reminds me of my youth in UNknown in my mother s family
there was a young UNknown strong as his bulls
she 's been very good
but she eats less and less
soon she UNknown l be skin and bone
we UNknown l take good care of her
thank you miranda for your patience your time and your advice !
so you refuse to eat ?
now you look so unhealthy
you re as pretty as ever
i hope miranda didn 't bore you with UNknown
meet UNknown personal physician of UNknown il the great pharaoh
medically they were so advanced
their preservation techniques prove it
nobody s ever done better
i 'm sure with all his secrets he UNknown l soon have you on your feet
i 'm very sorry miss blanc sec
i was about to slip you a note
i 'd no idea you were back
i was about to go out
i won t keep you
number them so i know where to begin
i mean you can read them later
that one s the most important
ok i will read them in the bath
i mean your room is beautifully decorated
can i do something to help ?
drink to my health !
UNknown your lawyer to see you
what are you doing here ?
professor i found UNknown mummy
and don t ask me how
i fear it will have to wait some more
i don t see how i can get out of here
anyway my mind is too busy controlling the bird
i wanted to UNknown my technique while you were in egypt
a 4 000 year old mummy will be child 's play
perhaps but the bird UNknown me
whenever i UNknown off its killer instinct takes over
my sister first then your giant insect
that 's fine by me but how will you get me out ?
i 'm here to see my client UNknown
mr saint hubert can we have a comment ?
hold back the reporters !
i cut short my african trip at the government 's UNknown
they have invited me as an expert to assist mr UNknown to dispatch this UNknown
it 's a great honour to put my talent at the service of the nation
mr saint hubert what approach will you use ?
first we UNknown l track it down to study its behaviour and habits
how will you find it ?
quite simply by raising our sights
you ve saved my life
come out wherever you are
it 's right here UNknown
it 's UNknown UNknown UNknown
it 's the best way to track an animal
in the bowl there 's a badge
you re armand petit blanchard head cook
petit blanchard i said !
someone stole my badge from my locker
i need a better plan
unless i 'm mistaken it could find sheep in 3 places
montmartre in the north the colonial exhibition in the east or the UNknown gardens
by the grace of god !
hurry up let 's go !
as daddy would say a battle that seems lost is the most exciting
it 's time to go
would you be so kind as to come back later ?
i really am very tired
that takes the biscuit !
on to the UNknown gardens
we UNknown l launch our assault at first light
i hope you had a good sleep
we have to go now
what are you doing here ?
it 's not by choice
where 's the professor ?
they transferred him last night
the guillotine tomorrow at dawn
mr president miss blanc sec 's here
you know i have a fond memory of that interview
the day after you were elected
it was my first interview
and the last time i laughed so much
as president you often UNknown the death penalty
we have 3 dead bodies including a prefect
he didn 't kill them
it was a prehistoric beast !
only the professor can control it
without him how many bodies will there be ?
miss we have put our finest men on the case
UNknown is a fine scholar
his research keeps science going forward
by taking his life you condemn so many others
i promise i UNknown l think it over
your ball 's over there !
your ball 's over here
come and fetch it !
take your paws off me !
are you hurt sir ?
i am fine go away !
both are wide open honestly
UNknown and patience are the hunter 's UNknown
tell me saint hubert could i nip off for a minute for some food ?
out of the question !
we are at war my friend
one day i hunted a tiger lying low in a UNknown temple
we went three days without food
how did you do it ?
i started by consulting all the books in the library which confirmed the animal 's UNknown nature
so i got the idea to collect the fragments of its egg and put them in a quiet place
you re a genius !
it 's nothing really just a little intuition
with intuition like that you must sweep the ladies off their feet my young friend !
that depends on the lady
are there two l 's in ad le ?
a d e l e blanc sec
i went to egypt not peru to find a doctor UNknown a charming but UNknown fellow
no the pet 's the dog
i summoned up all my courage and threw myself on the president
a heroic but calculated gesture intended to secure a pardon for the professor to save my sister
i was arrested for attacking him
one tiny detail escapes me
do you have to speak in morse or we UNknown l be all night ?
i save the president and that 's the thanks i get ?
things didn 't quite go to plan little sis
i need a bath to gather my wits
but aren 't you happier here UNknown the girls than in your tomb ?
you re a genius UNknown
be careful miss ad le
where are you from my beauty ?
i don t mean you !
in any case you have beautiful UNknown
clearly no ancestor of the nightingale
watch out it might think you re a goat
you want my feathers don t you ?
there you go that 's good
now we 'r e friends
i have a favour to ask of you
surely you re not going to
it 'd be rude not to
you re unbelievable miss blanc sec
now we UNknown e mastered the unbelievable let 's perform the impossible
this is so exciting !
you haven 't seen anything yet
and don t blink or you il miss it
i UNknown l be tipsy again
we 'r e just in time
an ugly little head he has
it was because of the egg
it was too much for him
they UNknown e put a bag on his head
it 's snatched a man
leave the rest to me
i UNknown l go right away
how can this be ?
what 's going on ?
UNknown you old blackguard !
UNknown well i never !
how on earth did you get here ?
that 's a very long story
you can tell it later
this winter over a hot chocolate
we have a mummy to wake and sister to save
yes she 's just joking
well i 'm not joking
tired after your trip ?
i should be going home
i UNknown l take you
you worthless nincompoop who allowed you to shoot at science ?
i am justin de saint hubert big game hunter
i 'm a hunter too but i only shoot black sheep
you seem a fine specimen
don t die now please !
i UNknown l do my best
if you want to help look after the UNknown
but the professor s bleeding
they 'r e connected !
don t ask how or why
if we lose one we lose both
don t let it happen
twenty eight rue du four
what do i do now ?
place antique objects in a circle around me
i 'm going to need to put this bandage on you
after death the whole body UNknown and locks itself in the mind which never dies
it 's going to work
i have to tidy up anyway
what a shame he 's gone
i 'd have liked to get to know him
what have we here ?
i detect a certain likeness
with the knowledge you possess perhaps you could try to bring her back to life ?
i 'm a nuclear UNknown
i deal in figures signs and UNknown
doctors don t leave the pharaoh s side and are buried next to them right next door
may i make some tea ?
kindness is a highly UNknown quality in our dynasty
i admit that throughout this adventure you have been very hospitable towards me and i 'd like to thank you
what happened to her ?
how do i look ?
why did my parents give her beauty and leave me only bitterness and jealousy ?
we 'd just turned twenty
we 'd discovered a new sport and played whenever we could
in order to avoid any sense of UNknown we never had an actual match
our games were strictly friendly
miss are you okay ?
she was born a few minutes after me but she departed well before me
it 's the only race i 'd have loved to lose
indeed a most regrettable accident
believe me i 'm very sorry i can 't help you
the professor did a remarkable job
his mental power must have woken the dead in a radius of 2 km
but i 'm not the right person
the waves UNknown out like when you throw a stone into water
and UNknown doctors never left his side ?
they never left the room even when he was mating
the mummies of UNknown il
UNknown you re a genius
excuse me i 'm looking for the UNknown exhibition
you il get us noticed
after 5 000 years in a tomb can 't i have some fun ?
of laughing if you wish
can you open it ?
i 'm no better a lock smith than a doctor
perhaps you could serve some kind of purpose or i UNknown l float you down the seine
the nile it isn t !
humour UNknown the savage breast
that 's not humour !
maybe it made the pharaohs laugh but this is the 20th century !
i UNknown l give you a massage later
you 'r e a UNknown now ?
no but i studied molecular energy
for now stick to opening doors
reminds me of when we painted
waking people no but knocking them out no problem
they 'r e all UNknown up
wake him so he can rearrange them
the faithful first so they 'r e there when the pharaoh wakes
poor dear don t want him feeling homesick
and definitely not insulted so i suggest we respect protocol
i 'm in favour of protocol
sorry to bother you are you a doctor ?
are you a surgeon ?
i 'm looking for a doctor
no you 'r e not a doctor !
what is that ridiculous attire ?
the natives employ women to write their UNknown ?
their civilization is still rough and ready but she is very UNknown and waking us was her good idea
i feel i UNknown e woken up a little early
sorry to wake you your highness i had no choice
it 's a matter of life or death
it comes and it goes
i 'd like my sister 's to come back
i wouldn t let you clip my nails
she 's looking for a doctor to treat her sister and we thought that in your great kindness you might let your personal physician take a look at the child
you woke me up for such a trivial affair ?
five thousand years you UNknown e been snoring away
i UNknown e had 5 years of grieving of suffering with my sister who can 't see me
i 'm a poor earth UNknown with no divine protection
i live everyday with the pain and guilt that never goes away
because it was all my fault !
it was my UNknown !
what 's this about a hat ?
nothing i UNknown l tell you later
see if you can give the girl a little life back
the doctors said if we took it out she d most likely die
you 'r e insane !
i asked you to cure her not kill her you bag of bones !
is the kiss necessary ?
not really more of a tradition
are you mad hitting the ball like that ?
and i love you more than the whole world
it was a privilege meeting you miss ad le
apologize to your pharaoh for me for being so rude
everything will be fine now i promise
which way to the nile please ?
they are very curious people
but they have highly developed artistic talents
this courtyard for example is magnificent
we should build a pyramid here
i 'm sure it would be a fine addition
meanwhile sire perhaps we should rejoin the others ?
curse of the pharaohs strikes paris !
read all about it !
mummies vanish from the louvre !
there you go sir !
curse of the pharaohs strikes paris !
what 's this now about mummies ?
it 's another anarchist plot
tuck in my little UNknown !
who 's it for ?
it was for miss ad le
give them to someone else
that 's so kind !
UNknown with a j as in
hurry miss we 'r e about to leave
all right keep your hair on
the woman in the green hat ?
it is miss blanc sec 's luggage
move fast for the luggage !
good start to the holiday
sorry it was an accident
that 's my bag !
take good care of it
have a good trip miss blanc sec
i UNknown e lost saint hubert !
i just lost him !
go and find him !
you put up a good fight
i m out of ammunition
i UNknown l get reinforcements
watch full movies at www awooh com
when i was lying there in the va hospital with a big hole blown through the middle of my life
i started having these dreams of flying
sooner or later though you always have to wake up
in UNknown you don 't dream at all
it doesn 't feel like 6 years
more like a fifth of tequila and ass kicking
tommy was the scientist not me
he was the one who wanted to get shot light years out in space to find the answers
are we there yet ?
yeah we 'r e there sunshine
it 's about your brother
so a week before tommy was gonna ship out
a guy with a gun ends his journey for the paper in his wallet
being in UNknown for 5 years 9 months and 22 days
you will be hungry you will be weak
if you feel UNknown please use the
yeah tommy was the scientist
me i 'm just another dumb grunt going some place he 's gonna regret
you grew up hearing about it but i never figured i 'd be going there
your brother represented a significant investment
we 'd like to talk to you about taking over his contract
and since your UNknown is identical to his you could step into his shoes
it 'd be a fresh start on a new world
let 's go UNknown packs on !
remember people you lose that mask you 'r e unconscious in 20 seconds
you 'r e dead in 4 minutes
let nobody be dead today
it looks very bad on my report
this is UNknown 1 6 on approach
one minute let 's go
when the ramp comes down go directly into the base
there 's no such thing as an ex marine
you may be out but you never lose the attitude
i told myself i could pass any test a man can pass
they can fix the spine if you got the money
but not on vet benefits not in this economy
let 's go special k
do not make me wait for you !
look at all this fresh meat !
but out here they 'r e just hired guns taking the money working for the company
aww man that is just wrong
you are not in kansas any more
you are on pandora ladies and gentlemen
respect that fact every second of every day
if there is a hell you might wanna go there for some r and r after a tour on pandora
out there beyond that fence every living thing that crawls flies or UNknown in the mud wants to kill you and eat your eyes for ju ju beads
we have an UNknown population of UNknown called the na UNknown i
they 'r e fond of arrows dipped in a UNknown that will stop your heart in one minute
and they have bones UNknown with naturally UNknown carbon UNknown
they are very hard to kill
as head of security it is my job to keep you alive
not with all of you
if you wish to survive you need to cultivate a strong mental attitude
it 's nothing like an old school safety brief to put your mind at ease
jake you 'r e jake right ?
you look just like him
sorry i 'm norm UNknown
i went through UNknown training with him
we 'r e gonna spend a lot of time here
how you doing norm UNknown driver
here 's the link room right here
this is where we 'r e connecting to the UNknown
me and norm are here to drive these remotely controlled bodies called UNknown
welcome to pandora good to have you
they fully mature on the flight out
so the progress up the UNknown seem to work really well
yeah they got great muscle tone
it UNknown l take us a few hours to get them prepared but you can take them out tomorrow
this is your UNknown now jake
the concept is that every driver is matched to his own UNknown
which is why they offered me the gig because i can link with tommy 's UNknown
i just say whatever to the video log ?
yeah we gotta get the habit of UNknown everything
what we see what we feel it 's all part of the science
and good science is good observation
they 'r e coming out
where 's the lab coat ?
where 's her lab coat ?
who 's got my goddamn cigarette ! ?
guys what 's wrong with this picture ?
grace UNknown is a legend
she 's the head of the UNknown program
i mean literally wrote the book on UNknown UNknown
that 's because she likes plants better than people
here she is cinderella back from the ball
grace i 'd like you to meet norm UNknown and jake sully
norm i hear good things about you
how 's your na UNknown i ?
grace this is jake sully
yeah yeah i know who you are and i don 't need you
you know the UNknown who trained for three years for this mission
i know it 's a big inconvenience for everyone
how much lab training have you had ?
i UNknown a frog once
they 'r e just UNknown on us with out even a courtesy of calling it rain
i 'm going to UNknown
no man this is such bullshit !
i 'm gonna kick his corporate butt
he has no business sticking his nose in my department
try and use big words
scorpion 2 hotel hell 's gate tower
you are cleared for south departure
no you didn 't you were looking at the monitor
i used to think it was UNknown neglect but now i see that you 'r e intentionally screwing me
grace i enjoy our little talks
i need a UNknown not some jar head drop out
how is this in any way UNknown UNknown ?
lucky your guy had a twin brother
and lucky that brother wasn 't some UNknown UNknown or something
a marine we could use
i 'm UNknown him to your team as security escort
the last thing i need is another trigger happy moron out there
look you 'r e supposed to be winning the hearts and the minds of the natives isn 't that the whole point of your little puppet show ?
you look like them you talk like them and they UNknown l start trusting us
we build them a school we teach them english
but after how many years relations with the UNknown are only getting worse
that tends to happen when you use machine guns on them
this is why we 'r e here UNknown
because this little gray rock sells for 20 million a kilo
that 's the only reason
it 's what pays for the whole party
now those savages are threatening our whole operation
we 'r e on the brink of war and you 'r e supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution
so use what you UNknown e got and get me some results
how much link time have you UNknown ?
you 'r e in there
but i read a manual
tell me you 'r e joking
so you just figured you 'd come out here to the most hostile environment known to man with no training of any kind and see how it went ?
what was going through your head ?
maybe i was sick of doctors telling me what i couldn 't do
just relax and let your mind go blank
that shouldn 't be hard for you
i have the first UNknown
i 'm going in in 4
jake can you hear me ?
can you hear me jake ?
we 'r e gonna take this nice and easy jake
and touch your thumb to your fingers
well if you want to sit up that 's fine
let 's take it nice and slow jake
no tranquil attacks here that 's good
do you feel UNknown or dizzy ?
system motor control is good
are you feeling any UNknown or pain ?
take it easy don 't get ahead of yourself okay ?
jake i need you to sit down
it 's ok i got this
jake you need to sit down
guys get him back on the UNknown now
you 'r e not used to your UNknown body this is dangerous
come on they 'r e gonna put you out
come on you ain 't got no skills
it 's ok i UNknown l get him
who did you expect numb nuts ?
motor control is looking good
c 'm on louise chop chop
don 't play with that you UNknown l go blind
i 'm trudy i fly all the UNknown
and this here is my baby
hey UNknown get it done
we bounce at 09 00
i 'm on it captain
mine strike 's still loose
you guys are packing some heavy gear
that 's cause we 'r e not the only thing flying around out there
but i need you on a door gun
i 'm a man short
thought you 'd never ask
see you on the flight lane
you wanted to see me colonel ?
this low gravity will make you soft
pandora will shit you out dead with zero warning
i pulled your record corporal
venezuela that was some mean bush
nothing like this here though
you got some heart kid showing up in this neighborhood
figured it 's just another hell hole
i was the first UNknown myself
few years ahead of you well maybe more than a few
three tours in UNknown not a scratch
think i felt like a UNknown louie ?
they could fix me up if i UNknown back
but you know what i kinda like it
it reminds me every day what 's waiting out there
the UNknown program is a bad joke
bunch a limp dick science majors
a UNknown UNknown re in an UNknown body
that 's a potent mix gives me the UNknown
such a marine could provide the intel i need right on the ground
right in the hostile 's camp
look sully i want you to learn these savages from the inside
i want you to gain their trust
i need to know how to force their cooperation or hammer them hard if they won 't
you walk like on of her science UNknown
but you report to me
can you do that for me son ?
son i take care of my own
you get me what i need i UNknown l see to it you get your legs back when you UNknown home
that sounds real good sir
just keep your mouth shut and let norm do the talking
all right i 'm going in
shut it down we 'r e gonna stay a while
one idiot with a gun is enough
UNknown they 'r e not aggressive
relax marine you 'r e making me nervous
so how will they know we 'r e here ?
i 'm sure they 'r e watching us right now
it 's that fast ?
that is signal UNknown from this root to the root of the tree next to it
you know it 's probably electrical based on the speed of the reaction
you UNknown l piss him off
it 's already pissed off
jake that armor is too thick trust me
it 's a territorial threat display do not run or he UNknown l charge
so what do i do ?
that 's what i 'm talking about bitch
that 's right get your punk ass back to mommy
you got nothing keep running
why don 't you bring back some friends
what about this one ?
run don 't run what ? !
we 'r e gonna have to call it guys we 'r e not allowed to run night ops
sorry doc he 's just gonna have to hang on till morning
he won 't make it till morning
i don 't have all goddamn night
i would have been screwed if you hadn 't come along
i just wanted to say thanks for killing those things
you don 't thank for this
whatever i did i 'm sorry
all this is your fault
they did not need to die
how am i the bad guy ?
if you love your little forest friends
why not let them just kill my ass ?
what 's the thinking ?
but stupid ignorant like a child
well if i 'm like a child then maybe you should teach me
sky people can not learn
teach me how to see
no one can teach you to see
come on can 't we talk ?
where did you learn to speak english ?
dr UNknown 's school ?
you 'r e like a baby
you should not be here
ok take me with you
seeds of the sacred tree
what 's your name ?
what 's going on ?
what 's he saying ?
what 's he saying ?
my father is deciding whether to kill you
it 's nice to meet you sir
that is mother she is UNknown the one who UNknown the will of UNknown
why did you come to us ?
we have tried to teach other sky people
it is hard to fill a cup which is already full
my cup is empty trust me
ask dr UNknown i 'm no scientist
a warrior of the UNknown clan
my daughter will teach you our ways
you were talking like a tick
you are not gonna believe where i am
the last thing we see is this marine 's ass disappearing in the bush with this angry UNknown coming after him
it 's not something you can teach
for reasons i cannot fathom the UNknown have chosen you
they 'r e gonna study me i have to learn to be one of them
that 's called taking initiative son
i wish i had ten more like you
sully just find out what the blue monkeys want
you know we tried to give them medicine education roads but no they like mud
and that wouldn 't bother me it 's just that their uh
their damn village happens to be resting on the richest UNknown deposit within 200 clicks in any direction
i mean look at all that UNknown
what if they won 't go ?
i 'm betting that they will
killing the UNknown looks bad
but there 's one thing that UNknown hate more than bad press
and that 's a bad UNknown statement
i didn 't make up the rules
that 's when the UNknown get there
well we 'r e wasting time
he 's the clan leader
she 's their spiritual leader
she UNknown l be the next UNknown
they become a UNknown pair
so who 's this UNknown ?
who 's UNknown ? !
their goddess made up of all living things
you 'd know this if you had any training whatsoever
who 's got a date with the chief 's daughter ?
you may tell her what to do inside
nah you 'd miss me
if you want to hit this thing it 's going to be complicated
your scan doesn 't show the internal structure
there 's an outer row of columns real heavy duty
there 's a secondary ring here and an inner ring
there 's a core structure like a UNknown
that 's how they move up and down
what else can you tell us about the structure ?
i 'm guessing this secondary ring that 's also load bearing
where are we going ?
i 'm not about to let UNknown and UNknown UNknown manage this thing
there 's a mobile link up as site 26 we can work out of way up in the mountains
the legendary floating mountains of pandora heard of them ?
we 'r e getting close
yeah look at my instruments
we 'r e in the flux UNknown
means you got to see where you 'r e going
ain 't that a bitch
you should see your faces
thank you for flying air pandora
so this is my bunk
grace didn 't miss a thing
she knew i was talking to the colonel
but i had what she needed a way back in with the clan
so she 's playing nice
you UNknown l be in the link at the end
do not look in her eye
when sa UNknown UNknown is made
only one hunter in the whole life
to become aron UNknown u hunter
this is video log 12
do i have to do this now ?
like i really need to get some rack
the days are starting to blur together
the language is a pain but
i figure it 's like field UNknown a weapon repetition repetition
if only you were stronger
norm 's attitude is improved lately
but it 's not just i 'm seeing you in front of me
it 's good he 's back on board but he thinks i 'm a UNknown too
you UNknown e got to run ok ?
i feel me getting tougher
i can run farther every day
i have to trust my body to know what to do
every day it 's reading the trail track 's of the UNknown UNknown on UNknown UNknown and sounds
she 's always going on about the flow of energy the spirits of animals
i really hope this tree hugging crap isn 't on the final
this isn 't just about eye hand coordination out there you know
you need to listen to what she says
try to see the forest through her eyes
excuse me this is my video log here
with UNknown it 's learn fast or die
you got to be kidding me
i talked moat into letting grace into the village
1st time since her school was closed down
i 'm trying to understand this deep connection the people have to the forest
she talks about a network of energy
that flows through all living things
she says all energy is only borrowed
and one day you have to give it back
learning to ride an UNknown we call them UNknown is the test every young hunter has to pass
jake sully will go first
now you choose your UNknown
this you must feel inside
if he also chooses you move quick like i showed
you will have one chance jake
how will i know if he chooses me ?
sa UNknown UNknown jake !
that 's right you 'r e mine
shut up and fly straight !
yeah baby i got this !
i may not be much of a horse guy but i was born to do this
i came like this this you
i turn i feel the wind i turn very strong
i see i bank so hard
UNknown UNknown it 's their most sacred place
see the flux UNknown and these full color images ?
that 's what messes up my instruments
there is something really interesting going on in there UNknown
i would die to get samples
i was a stone cold aerial hunter
our guys call it a great UNknown
it is UNknown last shadow
right it 's the last one you ever see
my grandfather 's grandfather was UNknown UNknown
it has only happen five times since the time from the first songs
he brought the UNknown together in a time of great sorrow
all na UNknown i people know the story
like out there is the true world and in here is the dream
it 's hard to believe it 's only been three months
i barely remember my own life
i don 't know who i am anymore
haven 't got lost in the woods have you ?
your last report was more than two weeks ago
i 'm starting to doubt your resolve
way i see it it 's time to terminate the mission
you UNknown e given me good UNknown intel
this tree of souls place
yeah i got them by the balls with that when this turns into a shit fight which it will
now is time to come in
by the way you 'r e gonna get your legs back
yeah i got you corporate approval
it 's a done deal gonna have you on a shuttle tonight
i 'm a man of my word
i got to finish this
it 's the final stage of becoming a man
if i do it i 'm one of them
they UNknown l trust me
and i can negotiate the terms of their UNknown
than you better get it done corporal
the na UNknown i say every person is born twice
this is a place for prayers to be heard
we call this tree UNknown UNknown
the voices of our ancestors
you may make your bow from the wood of UNknown
and you may choose a woman
we have many fine women
UNknown is the best singer
i don 't want UNknown
yes she is a good hunter
i UNknown e already chosen
but this woman must also choose me
i 'm with you now jake
we are UNknown for life
what the hell are you doing jake ?
don 't forget the phase UNknown middle button
don 't make me force feed a cripple
there i 'm done let 's go
and when was the last time you took a shower ?
i got a native doing a UNknown chicken here
he 's blocking my blade
keep going he UNknown l move
these people have to learn that we don 't stop
freeze it right there !
you do not speak here !
we are UNknown before UNknown
brother please do not attack the sky people
many UNknown will die if you do
you are not my brother !
and i am not your enemy !
the enemy is out there !
and they are very powerful !
i can talk to them !
i am UNknown i am one of you
and i have the right to speak
these words are like stones in my heart
you can 't interrupt a link in progress
i was sent here to
are you out of your UNknown mind ? !
what the hell is going on here ?
you let me down son
you found yourself some local tail and you completely forget what team you 'r e playing for ?
parker there is time to salvage this situation
shut your pie hole !
or what ranger rick ?
you gonna shoot me ?
you need to muzzle your dog
can we take this down a couple of notches please ?
you say you want to keep your people alive ?
start by listening to her
those trees were sacred to UNknown in a way you can 't imagine
you throw a stick in the air around here it 's gonna land on some sacred fern for christ 's sake
i 'm not talking about some kind of pagan voodoo
i 'm talking about something real something UNknown in a biology of the forest
which is what exactly ?
what we think we know is that there 's some kind of UNknown chemical communication between the roots of the trees
and each tree has 10 to the fourth connections to the trees around it
and there are 10 to the UNknown trees on pandora
which is a lot i 'm guessing
it 's more connections than the human brain
it 's a global network and the na UNknown i can access it
they can UNknown and UNknown data
what the hell have you people been smoking out there ?
they 'r e just goddamn trees
you need to wake up parker
no you need to wake up
the wealth of this world isn 't in the ground it 's all around us
the na UNknown i know that and they 'r e fighting to defend it
if you want to share this world with them you need to understand them
i 'd say we understand them just fine thanks to jake here
hey doc come take a look
they 'r e not gonna give up their home
they 'r e not gonna make a deal
there 's nothing that we have that they want
everything they sent me out here to do is a waste of time
they 'r e never gonna leave UNknown
i 'm getting all emotional
i might just give you big wet kiss
i UNknown l do with UNknown casualties to UNknown
i UNknown l drive them out with gas first
it UNknown l be humane
alright let 's pull the trigger
this is how it 's done
when people are sitting on shit you want you make them your enemy then you justify taking it
UNknown just rolled in the UNknown
dr UNknown you cannot be up here !
these are people you 'r e about to
they 'r e fly bitten savages that live in a tree
i don 't know about you but i see a lot of trees
can you guys just please
there are families in there
are you gonna kill children ?
you don 't want that kind of blood on your hands believe me
let me try to talk them out
we 'r e going in right now
run sequence UNknown 30 seconds
listen to me you UNknown e got one hour
tell them they 'r e gonna be here soon
you have to leave or you 'r e gonna die
are you certain of this ?
they sent me here to learn your ways
so one day i could bring this message and that you would believe it
what are you saying jake ?
at first it was just orders
i fell in love with the forest
you will never be one of the people !
he tried to stop them !
you have to go they are coming !
run to the forest !
they 'r e coming !
they want to destroy this place
UNknown you must go now
that is one big damn tree
i 'd say diplomacy has failed
alright people let 's get this done
i want every gas round you got right in the front door
sir they UNknown e opened fire
you got to be kidding me
these dumb bastards ain 't getting the message
we gotta move he 's gonna blow the columns !
all call signs switch missiles
give me he to the base of the west columns
yeah baby get some !
come on grace move !
what the hell are you doing ?
first round 's on me tonight
get away from here !
you can 't do that !
i was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace
you always have to wake up
what 's going on brother ?
personally i don 't feel these tree hugging traitors deserve steak
i got a situation here
it 's sector 1 6 UNknown engine start
this is gonna ruin my whole day
keep the pressure on grace
trauma kit 's forward on the bulk head
you 'r e clear !
norm you all good up there ?
at least they can 't track us up here
not this far into the UNknown
i 'm gonna get you some help grace
i 'm a scientist remember ?
i don 't believe in fairy tales
the people can help you i know it
why would they help us ?
the people say UNknown will provide
but no home no hope
there was only one place they could go
what 's the plan here jake ?
UNknown 't UNknown is the chief now
he 's not gonna let you near that place
i was in the place the eye does not see
i needed their help and they needed mine
but to ever face them again
i was gonna have to take it to a whole new level
sometimes your whole life boils down to one insane move
there 's something we gotta do
you 'r e not going to like it
the way i had it figured UNknown is the UNknown cat in the sky
so why would he ever look up ?
that was just a theory
i 'm not any more
i will fly with you
i beg the help of UNknown
look where we are grace
i need to take some samples
great mother may choose to save all that she is
she must pass through the eye of UNknown and return
i 'm with her jake
her wounds were too great
it was not enough time
she is with UNknown now
with your permission i will speak now
you would honor me by UNknown
the sky people have sent us a message
that they can take whatever they want
and no one can stop them
but we will send them a message
you ride out as fast as the wind can carry you
we tell the other UNknown to come
you tell that UNknown UNknown calls to them
and we will show the sky people
that they can not take whatever they want !
and that this this is our land !
we rode out to the four winds
to the horse UNknown of the plain
to the UNknown people of the eastern sea
when UNknown UNknown called them they came
everyone on this base everyone of you is fighting for survival and that 's a fact
there 's UNknown UNknown out there UNknown for an attack
these UNknown images tell me that the UNknown numbers have gone from few hundred to well over two thousand in one day
and more are pouring in
in a weeks time there could be 20 000 of them
at that point they will overrun our perimeter
that 's not gonna happen
our only security lies in UNknown attack
we will fight terror with terror
now the UNknown believe that this mountain stronghold of theirs is protected by their deity
and when we destroy it
we will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep that hey won 't come within a 1000 clicks of this place ever again
and that too is a fact
jake it 's crazy here full UNknown
they 'r e rigging the shuttle as a bomber
they got these huge UNknown of mine explosives for some shock and awe campaign
and i was hoping for some sort of tactical plan that didn 't UNknown UNknown
we 'r e going up against UNknown with bows and arrows
i have 15 UNknown out there
that 's over 2000 warriors
we fly them you fly them
their instruments won 't work up here
missile tracking won 't work
they UNknown l have to fire a line of sight
if they bring the fight to us then we have the home field advantage
if they get to it it 's over
that 's their direct line to UNknown their ancestors
it UNknown l destroy them
then i guess we better stop them
i 'm probably just talking to a tree right now
but if you 'r e there
i need to give you a heads up
if grace is with you
see the world we come from
there 's no green there
and they 'r e gonna do the same here
more sky people are gonna come
they 'r e gonna come like rain that never ends
you chose me for something
i will stand and fight
but i need a little help here
our great mother does not take sides jake
she protects only the balance of life
it was worth a try
this is group leader we 'r e entering the flux UNknown
switch to manual flight mode
i want this mission high and tight
i want to be home for dinner
alright ladies let 's bring the pain
eyes up check that overhead
all call signs papa has lead
escorts be close on my shuttle
we are gonna lose some paint in here
gun crews keep your head on a UNknown
make no mistake people they 'r e out there
alright people target in sight
UNknown 1 6 get your UNknown ready

nothing 's over while i 'm breathing
i kinda hoped you 'd say that
sully how does it feel to betray your own race ?
you think you 'r e one of them ?
the aliens went back to their dying world
only a few were chosen to stay
the time of great sorrow was ending
UNknown UNknown was no longer needed
well i guess this is my last video log
either way i 'm not gonna be coming back to this place
well i guess i better go
i don 't want to be late for my own party
it 's my birthday after all
this is jake sully signing off
watch full movies at www awooh com
are you here to kiii me ?
i know what this is
i UNknown e seen one before
it belonged to a man i met in a half remembered dream
what is the most UNknown parasite ?
once an idea has taken hold of the brain it 's almost impossible to UNknown
an idea that is UNknown formed UNknown understood that sticks
in the dream state your conscious defenses are UNknown and that makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft
mr UNknown we can train your subconscious to defend itself from even the most UNknown UNknown
how can you do that ?
because i am the most UNknown UNknown
i know how to search your mind and find your secrets
and i can teach them to you so that even when you 'r e asleep your defense is never down
look if you want my help you 'r e gonna have to be completely open with me
i need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife better than your UNknown better than anyone
if this is a dream and you have a safe fuii of secrets i need to know what 's in that safe
in order for this aii to work you need to completely iet me in
he 's playing with us
the information is in the safe
he iooked right at it when i mentioned secrets
what 's she doing here ?
just head back to the room
i 'i i take care of this
okay make sure you do
we 'r e here to work
if i jumped would i survive ?
with a clean dive perhaps
mal what are you doing here ?
you know that i am
but i can 't trust you anymore
looks iike arthur 's taste
actuaily the subject is UNknown to UNknown british painters
teii me do the children miss me ?
what are you doing ?
just getting some fresh air
did she teii you ?
or have you known aii along ?
that you 'r e here to steai from me or that we are actuaily asleep ?
i want to know the name of your employer
that depends on what you 'r e threatening
pain is in the mind
what are you doing ?
but the dream 's UNknown
i 'm gonna try to keep UNknown under a iittle bit ionger
this isn 't gonna work
you came prepared hmm ?
not even my head of security knows this apartment
how did you find it ?
it 's difficult for a man of your position to keep a love nest iike this secret particularly where there 's a married woman involved
they 'r e getting closer
weil that 's not true
you ieft out a key piece of information didn 't you ?
you held something back because you knew what we were up to
an audition for what ?
we UNknown every bit of information you had in there
do ieave me and go
that corporation that hired us they won 't accept failure
looks iike i 'm gonna have to do this a iittle more simply
teii us what you know !
i UNknown e always hated this carpet
it 's stained and frayed in such UNknown ways
but very definitely made of wool
right now i 'm iying on UNknown
which means i 'm not iying on my carpet in my apartment
dream within a dream huh ?
but in my dream you play by my rules
we 'r e not in your dream
how do you mess up the carpet ?
it wasn 't my fault
you 'r e the architect
i didn 't know he was gonna rub his cheek on it !
what the heii was aii that ?
i have it under control
i 'd hate to see you out of control
we don 't have time for this
who 's just okay ?
james we talked about this
i 'm gonna send some presents with grandpa aii right ?
weil down in the dream
i 'm uh sorry about your ieg
it 's getting worse isn 't it ?
one apology 's aii you 'r e getting aii right ?
we were supposed to deliver UNknown 's expansion plans to UNknown engineering two hours ago
by now they know we failed
it 's time we disappear
thought to come to me and bargain for his iife
do i offer you the satisfaction
but i can 't speak for UNknown engineering
if you can steai an idea from someone 's mind why can 't you plant one there instead ?
don 't think about elephants
but it 's not your idea because you know i gave it to you
the subject 's mind can always trace the UNknown of the idea
true inspiration 's impossible to fake
can you do it ?
are you offering me a choice ?
because i can find my own way to square things with UNknown
then you do have a choice
then i choose to ieave sir
you can 't fix that
no idea is simple when you need to plant it in somebody else 's mind
my main competitor is an old man in poor health
his son wiii soon inherit controi of the corporation
i need him to decide to break up his father 's empire
if i were to do this if i even could do it i 'd need a guarantee
how do i know you can deliver ?
do do you want to take a UNknown of faith or become an old man UNknown with regret waiting to die alone ?
i know how much you wanna go home
this can 't be done
just have to go deep enough
you don 't know that
i UNknown e done it before
who 'd you do it to ?
why are we going to paris ?
you never did iike your office did you ?
no space to think in that broom cupboard
is it safe for you to be here ?
UNknown between france and the united UNknown is a UNknown nightmare you know that
i uh brought these for you to give to the kids when you have a chance
it 'i i take more than the UNknown stuffed animal to convince those children they stiii have a father
i 'm just doing what i know
i 'm doing what you taught me
i never taught you to be a thief
no you taught me to navigate people 's minds
but after what happened there weren 't a whole iot of UNknown ways for me to use that UNknown
i think i found a way home
it 's a job for some very very UNknown people
people who i believe can fix my charges permanently
but i need your help
you 'r e here to corrupt one of my brightest and best
you know what i 'm offering
it 's the chance to build UNknown entire cities things that never existed things that couldn 't exist in the reai world
do you want me to iet someone else foilow you into your fantasy ?
they don 't actuaily come into the dream
they just design the UNknown and teach them to the dreamers
mai won 't iet me
those kids your grandchildren they 'r e waiting for their father to come back home
and this job this iast job that 's how i get there
i would not be standing here if i knew any other way
i need an architect who 's as good as i was
i 'd iike you to meet mr cobb
if you have a few moments
mr cobb has a job offer he 'd iike to discuss with you
i have a test for you
you 'r e not gonna teii me anything first ?
before i describe the job
you 'r e gonna have to do better than that
when we 'r e asleep our mind can do almost anything
imagine you 'r e designing a building
you consciously create each aspect
iike i 'm discovering it
now in a dream our mind continuously does this
we create and perceive our world simultaneously
and our mind does this so weii that we don 't even know it 's happening
by taking over the creating part
now this is where i need you
you create the world of the dream
we bring the subject into that dream and they fiii it with their subconscious
how could i ever acquire enough UNknown to make them think that it 's reality ?
weil dreams they feei reai while we 'r e in them right ?
it 's only when we wake up that we realize something was actuaily strange
let me ask you a question
you never reaily remember the beginning of a dream do you ?
you always wind up right in the middle of what 's going on
do how did we end up here ?
weil we just came from the uh
how did you get here ?
where are you right now ?
we 'r e dreaming ?
you 'r e in the middle of the workshop sleeping
because it 's never just a dream is it ?
and a face fuii of glass hurts iike heil
that 's why the military developed dream sharing
weil someone had to design the dreams right ?
why don 't you give us another five minutes ?
iike at ieast an hour
in a dream your mind functions more quickly therefore time seems to feei more slow
five minutes in the reai world gives you an hour in the dream
who are the people ?
remember you are the dreamer
you can UNknown talk to my subconscious
that 's one of the ways we extract information from the subject
how else do you do it ?
iike a bank vault or a jail
the mind UNknown UNknown it with information it 's trying to protect
i guess i thought that the dream space would be aii about the visual but it 's more about the feei of it
my question is what happens when you start messing with the physics of it ail ?
it 's something isn 't it ?
why are they aii iooking at me ?
because my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world
iike white blood UNknown fighting an infection
this is great but i 'm teiling you if you keep changing things iike this
jeez mind teiling your subconscious to take it easy ?
i cross it every day to get to the coilege
never re create places from your memory
you draw from stuff you know right ?
a UNknown or a phone booth
building a dream from your memory is the easiest way to iose your grasp on what 's reai and what is a dream
is that what happened to you ?
this has nothing to do with me understand ?
that why you need me to build your dreams ?
get off of her !
why wouldn 't i wake up ?
there was stiii time on the clock
you can 't wake up from within the dream unless you die
a UNknown it 's a smaii personal
i see you met mrs cobb
you need a smaii object UNknown heavy
it needs to be more unique than that
i can 't iet you touch it
that would defeat the purpose
dee only i know the balance and the weight of this particular UNknown die
UNknown 'i i be back
i UNknown e never seen anyone pick it up that quickly before
reality 's not gonna be enough for her now and when she comes back
when she comes back you 'r e gonna have her building UNknown
where are you gonna be ?
no he 's in UNknown
it 's UNknown 's back yard
it 's a necessary risk
weil there 's plenty of good thieves
we don 't just need a thief
rub them together aii you want they 'r e not gonna breed
i 'm gonna get you a drink
how 's your handwriting ?
no it 's perfectly possible
you stiii working with that stick in the mud ?
he is good at what he does right ?
oh he 's the best but he has no imagination
listen if you 'r e gonna perform UNknown you need imagination
let me ask you something
have you done it before ?
uh we got the idea in place but it didn 't take
you didn 't plant it deep enough ?
no it 's not just about depth
you need the simplest version of the idea in order for it to grow naturaily in your subject 's mind
it 's a subtle art
do what is this idea that you need to plant ?
we need the heir of a major corporation to dissolve his father 's empire
right there you have various UNknown UNknown and UNknown UNknown sentiments and so forth
but aii of that stuff it 's um
it 's reaily at the mercy of your subject 's prejudice you see ?
what you have to do is start at the absolute basic
the relationship with the father
do you have a chemist ?
he uh UNknown his own versions of the UNknown
why don 't you take me there ?
once you UNknown e iost your tail
that price on my head was that dead or alive ?
i 'i i meet you downstairs in the bar in say uh half an hour ?
no it isn 't you
not dreaming now are you ?
what are you doing in UNknown ?
cobb said you 'd be back
i tried not to come but
but there 's nothing quite iike it
it 's just pure creation
what kind of tricks ?
in a dream you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes
that UNknown you create closed UNknown
do a closed UNknown iike that wiii help you disguise the boundaries of the dream you create
but how big do these UNknown have to be ?
it could be anything from the floor of a building to an entire city
they have to be complicated enough that we can hide from the UNknown
and the better the maze
you wait they 'i i turn ugly
no one iikes to feei someone else messing around in their mind
cobb can 't build anymore can he ?
i don 't know if he can 't but he won 't
he won 't teii me
but i think it 's mal
what you see in there is just his projection of her
what was she iike in reai iife ?
to UNknown UNknown for a job ?
weil we 'd need you there to tailor UNknown specific to our needs
a dream within a dream ?
that many dreams within dreams is too unstable
you just have to add a sedative
the only way to know you UNknown e done the job is if i go in with you
i think is a good place to start
i 'i i show you
they come every day to share the dream
three four hours each day
about 40 hours each and every day
after a while it becomes the only way you can dream
they come to be woken up
the dream has become their reality
who are you to say otherwise sir ?
you know how to find me
you know what you have to do
what 's your problem with this mr fischer ?
that 's not your concern
mr UNknown this isn 't your UNknown corporate espionage
you asked me for UNknown
i do hope you understand the gravity of that request
now the seed that we plant in this man 's mind wiii grow into an idea
this idea wiii define him
it may come to change
weil it may come to change everything about him
we 'r e the iast company standing between them and UNknown energy UNknown
and we can no ionger compete
UNknown they 'i i controi the energy supply of half the world
in effect they become a new UNknown
that 's where we come in
how is robert fischer 's relationship with his father ?
rumor is the relationship is quite complicated
weil we can 't work based UNknown on rumor can we ?
fischer UNknown 's right hand man
it should be possible if you can get the right references
i 'm not UNknown settlement here
mr browning maurice fischer 's policy is always one of avoiding UNknown
weil shaii we voice your concerns with maurice directly ?
not sure that 's necessary
i told you keep out the damn wait
must be a cherished memory of his
i put it beside his bed
he hasn 't even noticed
robert we need to talk about a power of attorney
i UNknown e had ample opportunity to observe browning
do now in the first UNknown of the dream
then when we take him a UNknown deeper his own projection of browning should feed that right back to him
that 's the only way it wiii stick
your UNknown as always is much appreciated
i was just uh running some experiments
iet me take a iook
do you 'r e UNknown huh ?
an elegant solution for keeping track of reality
was it your idea ?
UNknown would spin it in the dream and it would never UNknown
arthur told me she passed away
how are the UNknown coming along ?
each UNknown UNknown to the part of the subject 's subconscious that we are trying to access
i have a question about this UNknown
don 't show me UNknown
only the dreamer should know the UNknown
why is that so important ?
in case one of us brings in our UNknown
we don 't want them knowing the details of the maze
you mean in case you bring mai in
you can 't build because if you know the maze then she knows it
weil she 'd sabotage the whole operation
you UNknown e gotta warn them if this is getting worse
no one said it 's getting worse
i need to get home
that 's aii i care about right now
why can 't you go home ?
for not asking whether i did
i wiii split up my father 's empire
now this is obviously an idea that robert himself would choose to reject which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious
we need to find a way to translate this into an UNknown concept
how do you translate business strategy into emotion ?
that 's what we 'r e here to figure out
robert 's relationship with his father
is UNknown to say the ieast
can we run with that ?
we suggest breaking up his father 's company as a screw you to the old man
no because i think positive emotion UNknown negative emotion every time
we aii yearn for reconciliation for UNknown
we need robert fischer to have a positive UNknown reaction to aii this
my father accepts that i want to create for myself not foilow in his footsteps
we 'r e gonna need to do a iittle better than might
UNknown 's not about being specific
on the top UNknown we open up his relationship with his father and say
i wiii not foilow in my father 's footsteps
then the next UNknown down we feed him
i wiii create something for myself
then by the time we hit the bottom UNknown we bring out the big guns
in other words more time on each UNknown
brain function in the dream wiii be about 20 times normal
and when you enter a dream within that dream the effect is UNknown
it 's three dreams that 's 10 hours times 20
math was never my strong subject
how much time is that ?
it 's a week the first UNknown down
dix months the second UNknown down and the third UNknown
who 'd wanna be stuck in a dream for 10 years ?
do once we UNknown e made the plant how do we get out ?
UNknown would be a kick
it 's that feeling of failing you get that UNknown you awake
UNknown you out of the dream
that 's the clever part
i UNknown the sedative to ieave inner ear function UNknown
the trick is to synchronize a kick that can penetrate aii three UNknown
nothing that they 'i i put him under for anyway
we need at ieast a good 10 hours
one of the UNknown flights in the world
he makes it every two weeks
it would have to be a 7 47
on a 7 47 the pilot 's up top the first class cabin 's in the nose so no one would walk through
you 'd have to buy out the entire cabin and the first class flight attendant
you know how to find me
you know what you have to do
you remember when you asked me to marry you ?
you said you had a dream
that we 'd grow old together
you shouldn 't be here
just wanted to see what kind of tests you 'r e doing on your own every night
this has nothing to do with you
this has everything to do with me
why do you do this to yourself ?
it 's the only way i can stiii dream
why is it so important to dream ?
in my dreams we 'r e stiii together
these aren 't just dreams
and you said never to use memories
you 'r e trying to keep her alive
you can 't iet her go
these are moments i regret
they 'r e memories that i have to change
weil what 's down there that you regret ?
this is your house ?
mine and mal 's yes
then i start to panic
but the moment 's past
i can 't change this moment
as i 'm about to caii out to them they run away
if i 'm ever gonna see their faces again
i UNknown e gotta get back home
UNknown walling in the UNknown
what are you doing here ?
i know who you are
what are you doing here ?
i 'm just trying to understand
how could you understand ?
do you know what it is to be a iover ?
i 'i i teii you a riddle
you 'r e waiting for a train
a train that wiii take you far away
you know where you hope this train wiii take you but you don 't know for sure
but it doesn 't matter
what is this place ?
this is a hotei suite where we used to spend our anniversary
i need you to stay here just for now !
you said we 'd be together !
you said we 'd grow old together !
do you think you can just build a prison of memories to iock her in ?
maurice fischer just died in UNknown
robert should accompany the body no iater than tuesday
i 'm coming with you
the team needs someone who understands what you 'r e struggling with
and it doesn 't have to be me but then you have to show arthur what i just saw
if i get on this plane and you don 't honor our agreement when we iand
i go to UNknown for the rest of my iife
complete the job en route i make one phone caii from the plane you have no trouble getting through immigration
i think this is yours ?
i couldn 't help but notice but you wouldn 't happen to be related to the maurice fischer would you ?
weil he was a very inspiring figure
i 'm sorry for your ioss
bit too much free champagne before takeoff ?
man UNknown in forelgn language on radlo
i thought it was free
there 's 500 in there
the UNknown 's worth more than that
you might at ieast drop me at my stop
i 'm afraid that it doesn 't
get fischer in the back room now
has he been shot ?
what happened to you ?
blocked by a freight train
why put a train in a downtown intersection ?
where 'd it come from ?
why the heii were we ambushed ?
those were not UNknown UNknown
they 'd been trained for god 's sakes
how could he be trained ?
fischer 's had an UNknown teach his subconscious to defend itself so his subconscious is UNknown
don 't teii me to calm down !
this was your job goddamn it !
this was your responsibility !
you were meant to check fischer 's background !
we are not prepared for this !
we have dealt with sub security before !
we 'i i be more carefui and we 'r e gonna be fine !
this was not a part of the plan !
put him out his misery
no don 't do that !
it won 't wake him up
what do you mean it won 't wake him up ?
when we die in a dream we wake up
do what happens when we die ?
weil what the heii is down there ?
nothing is down there except for what might have been ieft behind by anyone sharing the dream who 's been trapped there before
which in our case is just you
can 't even think about
do now we 'r e trapped in fischer 's mind battling his own private army
UNknown got first aid ?
you knew these risks and didn 't teii us ?
there weren 't meant to be risks
i didn 't know we 'd be dealing with gunfire
this was the only way to go three UNknown deep
you knew about this and went along with it ?
besides he said he 'd done it before
because that worked so good ?
that has nothing to do with it
i did what i had to to get to my children
you ied us into a war zone with no way out ?
there is a way out
we go any deeper we just raise the stakes
fischer 's security is surrounding this place
ten hours of flight time is a week at this UNknown
that means each and every one of us wiii be kiiled
that i can guarantee you
we have no other choice but to continue on and do it as fast as possible
let 's go shake him up
i 'm insured against kidnapping for up to 10 miilion
in your father 's office below the UNknown is his personai safe
that doesn 't mean you don 't know the combination
teii us what it is
you UNknown e got an hour
i was supposed to have aii night to crack this
and UNknown wasn 't supposed to be shot in the chest
i don 't know it
why does browning say you do ?
just iet me talk to him and i 'i i find out
those bastards have had at me for two days
they have someone with access to your father 's office
they thought i 'd know the combination but i don 't know it
maurice told me that when he passed you were the only one able to open it
no he never gave me any combination
i mean maybe you just didn 't know it was a combination
i don 't know some UNknown combination of numbers based on your experiences with maurice
we didn 't have very many uh UNknown experiences together
perhaps after your mother died
after my mother died you know what he told me ?
robert there 's reaily nothing to be said
oh weil he was bad with emotion
how 's he doing ?
he 's in a iot of pain
when we get down to the iower UNknown the pain wiii be iess intense
and if he dies ?
but when you wake up you won 't even remember that we had an arrangement
UNknown is gonna become your reality
you 'r e gonna be iost down there so iong that you 'r e gonna become an old man
i 'i i come back
these people are gonna kiii us if we don 't give them the combination
they just wanna ransom us
what is in the safe ?
maurice 's wiii is with port and dunn
this would UNknown the other if you want it to
it splits up the UNknown businesses of fischer morrow
it 'd be the end of the entire empire as we know it
destroying my whole inheritance ?
why would he suggest such a thing ?
i just don 't know
at the end he cailed me in to his deathbed
but he took the trouble to teii me one iast thing
when were you in UNknown ?
you might have the rest of the team convinced to carry on with this job
the truth that at any minute you might bring a freight train through the wail
the truth that mai is bursting through your subconscious
and the truth that as we go deeper into fischer we 'r e also going deeper into you
and i 'm not sure we 'r e gonna iike what we find
we were exploring the concept of a dream within a dream
i wanted to go deeper and deeper
how iong were you stuck there ?
how could you stand it ?
UNknown it just became impossible for me to iive iike that
what happened when you woke up ?
that our world wasn 't real
i can teii the difference
if this is my dream why can 't i controi this ?
no matter how much i begged no matter how much i pleaded
just just step back inside
now you iisten to me
if you jump you 'r e not gonna wake up remember ?
you 'r e gonna die
UNknown back inside so we can talk about this
come out onto the UNknown
we 'r e gonna talk about this
you know i can 't do that
take a second think about our children
if i go without you they 'i i take them away anyway
what does that mean ?
i filed a ietter with our attorney explaining how i 'm UNknown for my safety
how you UNknown e threatened to kiii me
why did you do this ?
why would you do this to me ?
i UNknown e freed you from the guilt of choosing to ieave them
we 'r e going home to our reai children
iook at me please ?
you 'r e waiting for a train
mal goddamn it don 't do this !
a train that wiii take you far away
james and UNknown are waiting for you !
but it doesn 't matter
UNknown had herself declared sane by three different psychiatrists
i ieft my children behind and i UNknown e been trying to buy my way back ever since
it 's what powers her
but you are not responsible for the idea that destroyed her
and if we are gonna succeed in this you have to forgive yourself and you 'r e gonna have to confront her
but you don 't have to do that alone
no you 'r e not
i 'm doing it for the others
because they have no idea the risk they UNknown e taken coming down here with you
i don 't know any combination
how about instinctively huh ?
i got somebody in your father 's office right now ready to tap in the combination
give me the first six numbers that come to your head right now
i said right now !
five two eight four nine one
we 'r e worth more to you alive
what 'd you get ?
relationship with his father is worse than we imagined
this helps us how ?
the stronger the issues the more UNknown the UNknown
how are we gonna reconcile them ?
the UNknown are closing in quick
you mustn 't be afraid to dream a iittle bigger darling
we need to shift his UNknown from his father to his godfather
destroy his one positive relationship ?
no repair his relationship with his father whilst exposing his godfather 's true nature
we should charge fischer a iot more than UNknown for this job
his security is gonna get worse as we go deeper
the second we get into that hotei his security 's gonna be aii over us
we run with mr charles iike on the UNknown job
yeah and it didn 't work
but you iearned a iot right ?
how about a iovely iady that i UNknown e used before ?
you drive carefuily aii right ?
everything down there is gonna be unstable as heil
don 't jump too soon
we only got one shot at that kick
i 'i i play the music to iet you know it 's coming
the rest is on you
am i boring you ?
i was teiling you my story
i have a iot on my mind
pleasure to see you again
in case you get bored
must UNknown e blown you off
that is unless her phone number reaily is only six UNknown
the UNknown alone is worth at ieast 500
don 't worry about it
my people are already on it as we speak
who or what is mr charles ?
and why don 't you approve ?
it involves teiling the mark that he 's dreaming which involves attracting a iot of attention to us
do now you UNknown e noticed how much time cobb spends doing things he says never to do
mr UNknown can i have a moment ?
UNknown on the plane ?
no it 's much closer
but that 's not true at ail is it ?
my name is mr charles
you remember me don 't you ?
i 'm the head of your security down here
get out on a different floor keep moving
you 'r e talking about dreams ?
are you talking about um UNknown ?
i 'm here to protect you in the event that someone tries to access your mind through your dreams
you 'r e not safe here
UNknown weather isn 't it ?
quick give me a kiss
they 'r e stiii iooking at us
yeah it was worth a shot
pay attention to the UNknown of the weather the shift in gravity
none of this is real
you 'r e in a dream
now the easiest way for you to test yourself is to try and remember how you arrived at this hotel
i 'm a projection of your subconscious
i was sent here to protect you in the event that UNknown tried to puii you into a dream
what are you doing ?
these men were sent here to UNknown you aii right ?
if you want my help you have to remain calm
if this is a dream
i should just kiii myself to wake up right ?
i believe they have you UNknown and if you puii that trigger you may not wake up
you may go into a further dream state
now you know what i 'm talking about
remember what i said to you
what do you remember from before this dream ?
there was um a iot of gunfire
oh my god we UNknown e been kidnapped
where were they holding you ?
they had us in the back of a van
that explains the gravity shifts
it had something to do with um
UNknown to do with a safe
god why is it so hard to remember ?
it 's iike trying to remember a dream after you UNknown e woken up
listen it takes years of practice
you and browning have been puiled into this dream because they 'r e trying to steai something from your mind
i need you to focus and try and remember what that is
they demanded the first numbers to pop into my head
they 'r e trying to extract a number from your subconscious
we 'r e in a hotei right now
we should try hotei rooms
try and remember for me
five two it was something it was a iong number
i have to judge it for myself
while you 'r e aii asleep in 528
i wait for yusuf 's kick
weil how wiii you know ?
and then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge that should be unmistakable
do we get a nice UNknown kick
if it 's too soon we won 't get puiled out
but if it 's too iate
i won 't be able to drop us
because the van wiii be in UNknown
do you know what that is
they were trying to put you under
i see you UNknown e changed
that 's fischer 's projection of browning
you said you were kidnapped together ?
and you saw them torture him ?
you 'r e trying to get that safe open ?
to get the alternate wiil ?
fischer morrow has been my entire iife
i can 't iet you destroy it
i 'm not gonna throw away my inheritance
i couldn 't iet you rise to your father 's iast taunt
that 's his iast insult
a UNknown for you to build something for yourself by teiling you you 'r e not worthy of his accomplishments
what but that he was um disappointed ?
you can build a better company than he ever did
how do you know ?
trust me it 's what i do
he 's hiding something and we need to find out what that is
i need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you
whose subconscious are we going into exactly ?
we 'r e going into fischer 's
i told him it was browning 's so he 'd be a part of our team
UNknown 's gonna run you down hard
and i wiii iead them on a merry chase
just be back before the kick
what 's down there ?
UNknown the truth we want fischer to iearn
UNknown this is your dream
i need you to draw the security away from the complex understand ?
if i know the route everything could be compromised
brief him on the route into the complex
i 'i i be iistening in the whole time
you 'r e not coming in ?
cobb do you hear that ?
i first noticed it about 20 minutes ago
do what do we do ?
yusuf 's 10 seconds from the jump
can they make that route in an hour ?
they have to climb to the terrace
it 's designed as a UNknown
did UNknown add any features ?
i don 't think i should teii you
we don 't have time for this
did he add anything ?
cobb did we miss it ?
we finish the job before the next kick
how do i drop you without gravity ?
they 'r e heading your way
just buy us more time aii right ?
that 's the UNknown outside the strong room
does the strong room have windows ?
it wouldn 't be very strong if it did
let 's hope fischer iikes what he finds in there
you 'r e clear but hurry
there 's someone in there
no she is not real
how do you know that ?
i couldn 't shoot her
there 's no use in UNknown him
his mind 's already trapped down there
do that 's it then ?
i wanted to know what was gonna happen in there
i swear we had this
let 's set the charges
no there 's stiii another way
we have to foilow fischer down there
no but there wiii be enough time down there
and we wiii find him
okay as soon as arthur 's music kicks in just use the UNknown to revive him
we can give him his own kick down below
look you get him in there
as soon as the music ends you blow up the hospital and we aii ride the kick back up the UNknown
it 's worth a shot if UNknown can hold the guards off while i set the charges
UNknown wiii never make it wiii he ?
we UNknown e gotta try this
if you are not back before the kick
i am gone with or without you
can i trust you to do what needs to happen here ?
mal 's gonna be down there
i know where to find her
UNknown 'i i have fischer
how do you know ?
because she wants me to come after him
UNknown wants me back down there with her
i need you to take care of fischer while i go set some charges okay ?
no room for tourists on these jobs
you built aii this ?
that was our first apartment
then we moved to that building right there
after mai became pregnant that became our home
you UNknown aii of this from memory ?
that 's the house mai grew up in
we both wanted to iive in a house but we loved this type of building
how are we gonna bring fischer back ?
and the UNknown seed of an idea can grow
the UNknown idea such as
your world is not real
dimple iittle thought that changes everything
do certain of your world
do you think he is ?
you know what i have to do
i have to get back to our children because you ieft them
and you 'd iike to see their faces again wouldn 't you ?
those aren 't my children
what if you 'r e wrong ?
what if i 'm what 's real ?
you keep teiling yourself what you know
but what do you believe ?
and no matter what i do no matter how hopeless i am no matter how confused that guilt is always there reminding me of the truth
that the idea that caused you to question your reality came from me
you planted the idea in my mind ?
what is she talking about ?
the reason i knew UNknown was possible was because i did it to her first
that death was the only escape
a train that 'i i take you far away
you know where you hope this train wiii take you but you can 't know for sure
yet it doesn 't matter
now teii me why !
that even after you came back to reality that you 'd continue to believe your world wasn 't real
that death was the only escape
i was trying to save you
but you can make amends
you can stiii keep your promise
cobb we need to get fischer
you can 't have him
if i stay here wiii you iet him go ?
what are you talking about ?
fischer is on the porch
cobb you can 't do this
you take fischer with you aii right ?
you can 't stay here to be with her
UNknown 's dead by now
that means he 's down here somewhere
that means i have to find him
i can 't stay with her anymore because she doesn 't exist
i wish more than anything but i can 't imagine you with aii your UNknown aii your perfection aii your UNknown
you 'r e just a shade
you 'r e just a shade of my reai wife
and you were the best that i could do but i 'm sorry you 'r e just not good enough
you have to go now !
don 't iose yourself !
find UNknown and bring him back !
you said you dreamt that we 'd grow old together
i miss you more than i can bear but we had our time together
and i have to iet you go
i have to iet you go
you know the wiii means that dad wanted me to be my own man not just to iive for him
he 'i i be iost
have you come to kiii me ?
we were young men together
i 'm an old man
i UNknown e come back for you
to remind you of something
that this world is not real
to convince me to honor our arrangement ?
to take a UNknown of faith yes
come back so we can be young men together again

keep your head down and don 't say anything until we make the the swap
you don 't understand what ?
all the rules say to leave me that one life is not worth blowing operational cover
once he found out where you were there was no stopping him
we didn 't need the publicity so i figured we better do something or he 's gonna invade this god damn republic himself

i 'm surprised he didn 't call you your majesty
i like the ring of that
i think i prefer your majesty
how did the UNknown office briefing go ?
the president wants to know what 's happening in russia the day before it happens
are you sure about this ?
once you start pushing papers there 's no turning back
i had the strangest feeling when i was out last time
we got a walk in
guess he 's not buying our cover
you get his UNknown UNknown ?
he says he 's UNknown but won 't give us any more
he 's a strange guy
how 's his english ?

yeah and i got a plane to catch
come on salt no one can sort out a nut job from the real thing faster than you
we UNknown l decide when we know more
commencing audio and visual recording
interview has UNknown at 14 42
a husband must be a distraction for a female intelligence officer
well we 'r e here to talk about you
so what is your name ?
my name is alec UNknown UNknown
are you selling secrets for UNknown or are you afraid of dying ?
if i have gained anything by UNknown myself it is that i no longer have anything to fear
shows up in UNknown in UNknown blast siberia
he 's on victor UNknown 's staff there
he checks out as UNknown
the scan says he 's truthful on the cancer
i have somewhere i need to be mr UNknown
so if you wouldn 't mind getting to the point
in a gymnasium a soviet olympic wrestler named UNknown UNknown meets for the first time the only female chess UNknown of her era
within a month they were married
and within a year a child
one month more the child was back in the same hospital sick with fever
and within days after that the child suddenly was dead
yes a child was dead and yes a child was buried
but the UNknown baby was still alive
and became the property of another man
a master spy who had devised the greatest plan a russian patriot could ever invent
a plan to destroy america
it had all started with an american named lee harvey UNknown
in UNknown he UNknown to russia
three years later he returned home
but the man who came back to america was in fact a russian spy named alec
alec became the first success of the new program and a hero of the soviet union
the spy master was now given the go ahead to create many more like alec
males and females to be substituted for americans
at an abandoned monastery UNknown and other boys and girls learned english long before they learned russian
and by methods of UNknown physical and psychological UNknown
the spy master made warriors of iron
you 'r e killing me man
it 's a story without hope
UNknown was matched with a child of a visiting american family
there was an accident the family died
UNknown was sent to america to live a complete lie and to patiently await the day to attack from within day x
the long awaited mission is here
UNknown will travel to your city to kill the president of russia at the funeral of the american vice president
it 's an urban legend
what 's the matter ted ?
you don 't believe in moles ?
i believe in moles alright

with bombings of u s diplomats in moscow
the russian armed forces have been put on high alert
responding to a rapid UNknown crisis
president lewis has called for an emergency white house meeting
when i saw you in washington i almost was in tears
you were not supposed to get married
not unless it cut a great tactical advantage
i did it to seem normal
when you escaped today i felt not even i could have hoped for so much
you are my greatest creation
i had to be certain
so tell me what 's next
how long have you been here ?
i left russia one year after you to prague
i have been a UNknown liaison to the white house for three years
don 't worry we have plenty of time
the bunker eight stories below the white house

how do we do it ?
don 't worry he will be there
that 's my job to make sure he 's there
and what 's my job ?
do you remember UNknown when we were young ? and you had to finish first in everything
you had to be the best at everything
tonight you will finish ahead of me again
tonight you will kill america 's president
pop the hood and open the trunk
they spend more time looking at it than the doctor did
patience is key i UNknown e been coming here for two years
others have been here longer
but you were the best of us
and i was the least
there must be others here to finish what we begin
you have exactly two minutes before the main meal
ted your russian cla agent salt what can you tell us about her ?
we think she may be a soviet plant
UNknown years ago in preparation for something the UNknown called day x
a day that would mark the start of a large scale strike against the u s and her allies
that should be the president now
you have a big job UNknown but you can do it
it 's a god damn attack
i think i saw her

evelyn salt on the premises

mr president director medford is up
mary anne what is the situation ?
it should be coming up on one of your screens
what you see there represents temperature drops in mobile missile units in siberia
it means that the russians are UNknown their missiles to the field
and that 's been confirmed on the ground mr president
mr president i strongly recommend we go from UNknown 4 to UNknown 2
and since the russians are UNknown we need to look at our own nuclear attack options
the outer door is jammed and non responsive
we just lost the feed from most of our security camera 's

command our eyes are down both ways and we have a UNknown security door UNknown

only secret service possess fire arms in the presidents facility
screw protocol james we got an enemy agent out there
my name mr president is nicolai tchaikovsky
unless you do exactly as i say i will be the last person you will ever see
let 's have a look at some attack options
why didn 't you tell me ?
you know when we first came to langley
i didn 't think i UNknown l be able to do it
to resist the temptation to say something
what you are seeing are live pictures of russian president UNknown arriving at the airport outside of moscow
president UNknown 's mistaken death was UNknown to a temporary paralysis from a UNknown derived from spider venom
at least i was right
i had a feeling we 'd lost you back there in north korea
i could see how moved you were with mike 's little white knight routine
you were supposed to recruit the man not fall in love with him
that 's why i told UNknown to pick him up
by the way how is mike ?
oh that 's good news
i detect if you twist his arm you get to blow your cover to the cla
he wanted you to come out of this thing alive
you needed somebody to take the blame
i 'm the bad guy
get on the floor now
show me your hands !
show me your hands !
what is your name sir ?
i 'm theodore winter cla
mr president mr president can you hear me ?
i want her alone in a room
if there are other ka 's out there i want her to talk
she 's trained not to talk no matter what we do to her
if we 'r e gonna find these people must find them ourselves
at least some of them in the east river
she 's yours for 15 minutes during the flight
why 'd you kill him ?
by this i take it you think everybody s who they say they are
you knew something was wrong the moment UNknown walked in
you expect me to believe that winter was gonna launch the missiles and you saved the world ?
i would like you to believe that yeah
he 's dead now so he can 't defend himself
i guess you UNknown l just have to decide for yourself
how many more like you are there ?
more than you or i can handle alone
do you really think a trained soviet agent couldn t kill the russian president at point blank range if she wanted to ?
or you for that matter
i could UNknown e killed you at the funeral and i didn 't
you surrendered to me because i gave you no choice
if i did believe you and i 'm not saying for a second that i do but if i did nobody else would
well maybe you can think of a way around that
they took everything from me
UNknown the UNknown cat watch full movies online at www awooh com
did you know there are more people with genius iq s living in china than there are people of any kind living in the united states ?
that can 't possibly be true
what would account for that ?
well first of all a lot of people live in china
how do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got 1600 on their sat 's ?
i didn 't know they take sat s in china
they dont i wasn 't talking about china anymore i was talking about here
yes i can sing in a UNknown group
does that mean that you actually got nothing wrong ?
or you row crew or you invent a 25 dollar UNknown
or you get into a final club
or you get into a final club exactly
you know from a UNknown perspective sometimes not being in an UNknown group can be a good thing
well i am admitting i do like guys who row crew
i like guys who row crew
yes i got nothing wrong on the test
have you ever tried ?
to get into a final club
sometimes you say two things at once and i 'm not sure which one we 'r e aiming at
okay UNknown they re bigger than me
they 'r e world class athletes
and a second ago you said you like guys who row crew crew so i assumed you 'd met one
i guess i meant i liked the idea of it
can we get something to eat would you rather talk about something else ?
no it 's just that since the beginning of the conversation about finals clubs i think i may have missed a birthday
there are more people in china with genius
iq 's than the entire population of
the phoenix is the most UNknown
the fly club roosevelt punched the UNknown
the UNknown the UNknown it 's the best of the best
is it true they send a bus around to pick up girls who want to party UNknown the next
you can see why its so important to get in
okay well which is the easiest one to get into ?
why would you ask me that ?
none of them thats the point
our UNknown eduardo made 300 000 betting on UNknown last UNknown and
eduardo wont come close to UNknown the ability to UNknown doesn 't impress anybody around here
he made 300 000 in a summer ?
i thought it was oil UNknown you can read the weather you can predict the price of heating oil
you asked me which one was the easiest to get into because you think that 's where i have the best chance
the one that 's easiest to get into would be the one where anybody had the best chance
you didnt ask which one was the best one you asked me which one was the easiest
i was asking just to ask
you 'r e obsessed with the finals clubs
you have finals clubs UNknown and you need to see someone about this who UNknown l prescribe some sort of medication
final clubs and there 's a difference between being obsessed and being UNknown
well you do that was UNknown so you do speak in code
i didn 't mean to be UNknown
because they re exclusive beat and fun and they lead to a better life
you think teddy roosevelt got elected president because he was a member of the phoenix club ?
he was a member of the UNknown and yes he did
well why dont you concentrate on being the best you you can be
did you really just say that
im just stating the fact that does 'n t make it any less
were not dating anymore im sorry
is this a joke ?
you 'r e breaking up with me ?
you 'r e going to introduce me to people i wouldn 't normally get to meet ?
what was it supposed to mean ?
erica the reason we 'r e able to sit here and drink is that you used to sleep with the door guy
the door guy 's name is bobby
i haven 't slept with the door guy the door guy 's a friend of mine
he 's a perfectly good class of people and what part of long _ island are you from UNknown ?
i 'm going back to my dorm
then i apologize okay ?
i 'm sorry and i mean it
i appreciate that but i have to study
you don 't have to study
i have to go study
you don 't have to study
why do you keep saying i dont have to study
because you go to b u !
do you want to get some food ?
i 'm sorry you 'r e not sufficiently impressed with my education
and i 'm sorry i don 't have a rowboat
i think we should just be friends
i don 't want to be friends
i was being polite i had no intention UNknown friends with you
im under some pressure right now from my UNknown class
if we could just order some food
you 'r e going to be a very UNknown computer person
but you 'r e going to go through life thinking that girls don 't like you because you 'r e a UNknown
and i want you to know from the bottom of my heart that that won 't be true
it UNknown l be because you 'r e an asshole
you think that 's because her family changed their name from albrecht or do you think it 's because all b u girls are bitches ?
for the record she may look like a UNknown but she 's getting all kinds of help from our friends at victoria 's secret
she 's a UNknown as in barely anything there false advertising
the truth is she has a nice face
i need to think of something to help me take my mind off her
easy enough except i need an idea
i 'm a little intoxicated i 'm not gonna lie
so what if it 's not even UNknown and it 's a tuesday night ?
the UNknown UNknown is open on my UNknown and some of these people have pretty UNknown facebook UNknown
billy UNknown 's sitting here and had the idea of putting some of the pictures next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on who 's hotter
the first thing we 'r e going to need is a lot of pictures
unfortunately harvard doesn 't keep a public UNknown facebook so i 'm going to have to get all the images from the individual houses that people are in
they 'r e also open but with no UNknown on apache
i can run an empty search and it returns all of the images in the UNknown in a single page
adams has no security but limits the number of results to 20 a page
all i have to is UNknown the same script i used on lowell and its done
quincy has no online facebook what a sham
there is nothing i can do about that
not only is there no public directory but there 's no directory at all
you have to do searches and if your search returns more then 20 matches nothing gets returned
once you do get results they dont link directly to the images they link to a UNknown that UNknown or something weird
this maybe UNknown i il come back later
UNknown is a little better
its a UNknown search but you can do an empty search and gets links to pages with a UNknown picture
its slightly obnoxious that they let you view one picture at a time
and theres no way i am gonna go to 500 hundred pages to UNknown UNknown 1 at a time
you and erica split up ?
how did you know that ?
i 'm here for you
no i need the UNknown you used for the oil UNknown
we 'r e ranking girls
you think that 's such a good idea ?
i need the UNknown ?
i need the UNknown ?
give UNknown UNknown a base rating of 1400
at any time girl a has a rating r a and girl b has e rating r b
and those expectations are expressed this way
the one on the left
who are you gonna send it to ?
just a couple of people
the question is who are they gonna send it to ?
hey guys check this out
all night he UNknown about you
you dont want to read this
i stole it from a train
get the hell out of here
thats an awful lot of traffic
at 4 in the morning
well there is an unusual amount of traffic which UNknown
your saying its UNknown for 4 in the morning
the harvard network is about to crash
unless this a coincidence i would think this is us
so your called in front of the add board
you were 'n t called in front of the UNknown board
no i was back at the bar with erica UNknown
she said all that that i said that stuff to her
i was reading from the transcript of her deposition
why UNknown you even need to UNknown her
thats really for us to decide
why dont we stretch our legs for a minute can we do that
its been almost 3 hours and frankly you did spend an awful lot of time UNknown mr UNknown with the girls testimony from the bar
i am not UNknown she just made alot of that up
i guess that would be the first time someone lied under oath
those guys are really fast
is there anyway to make this a fair fight
we 'd have to jump out and drown
we are UNknown identical we would stay in one place just row the damn boat
two UNknown ago a UNknown choked the network with a UNknown from UNknown
he set up a UNknown were we vote the UNknown of female UNknown
what were we doing that none of us heard about this
i do not know 3 hour technical row before breakfast full course load studying
another 3 hours in the tank then studying
im not sure how we missed it
how much activity was on this thing
twenty two thousand page requests
this is half of facebook 7 houses
he developed the site in 1 night and he did it while he was drunk
how do you know he was drunk
he was UNknown while doing this
cameron worth UNknown cameron UNknown the UNknown way
taylor UNknown taylor UNknown the UNknown way
my last UNknown the same as my brother
mr UNknown this is an administrative board hearing
your being accused of intentionally UNknown security violating copyright violating individual privacy
by creating the UNknown www UNknown com
you also charged with being in violation of UNknown policy on distribution of UNknown images
i have already UNknown in the crimson to the UNknown
to harvard UNknown women 's association and to any women at harvard who might have been insulted as i take that they were
as for any charges UNknown from the breach of security
i believe i pointed out some pretty gaping holes in your system
im in charge of security for all computers on the harvard network
i can assure you of its UNknown
in fact it was that level of UNknown that led us to you in less then 4 hours
that would be impressive except if UNknown known what you are looking for you would seen it written on my dorm room window
so six months academic probation
wow they had to make an example out of you
i should have written nothing about the farm animals that was stupid
i was kidding for gods sake doesnt anybody have a sense of humor
how do you do this thing were you manage to get all girls to hate us
why do i love china
ok lets look at a sample problem
suppose were given a computer a 16 bit UNknown address and a page size of 256 UNknown
the system uses a one level page table that starts at address UNknown
maybe you want dna on your 16 bit system who knows
the first few pages are reserved for the hardware flag etc assume page table UNknown have 8 status UNknown
eight bit status code will then be
ah i see we have our first surrender
dont worry mr UNknown brighter men then you have tried and failed this class
one valid bit one UNknown bit one reference bit 5 permission bit
good funny never heard that before
what can i do for you ?
did i insult your girlfriends ?

we have an idea we want to talk to you about ?
you guys look like you guys spent some time at the gym

we checked you out you also built UNknown
we were talking about UNknown
kind of a no UNknown you in high school to right ?
asked for an UNknown player that UNknown your taste in music

ok well we have something we have been working on for a while idea
we think its great it is called the harvard network
you can create your own page interests UNknown UNknown
were going to use the most UNknown e mail in the country
based on the idea that girls
girls want to only go out with guys who go to harvard
me and my brother dont have trouble getting
yeah wed love for you to work with us mark
we need a UNknown who is creative
and we know who can take the initiative
this could help UNknown your image
wow you would do that for me
we 'd like to work with you
our first program graduated and went to work for UNknown
our second UNknown is overwhelmed with school work
thats what you said ?
it was three or four years ago i dont know what i said
when did you come to eduardo ?
i dont understand that question
when i did you come to eduardo with the idea for facebook
it was called UNknown then
this doesnt need to be that UNknown
im currently in the middle of two different UNknown
did you answer UNknown ?
when taylor and cameron UNknown did in november ask you to build harvard connection
did you say yes ?
i said i 'd help
when did you approach mr savarin with the idea for the facebook
you can answer the question
why are guys like me generally attracted to UNknown girls
but UNknown girls are generally attracted to guys like me
i dont know if an UNknown could find the connection to you
its not that complicated there hot there smart they are not jewish they cant dance
i think ive come up with something
i got pinched by the phoenix club
its the first in a 4 step process

you got pinched by the phoenix
what did you want to talk to me about
mark you said you come up with something
yeah ive think i come up with something come outside
i cant stair at that thing UNknown falls it has nothing to do with the UNknown
people came to UNknown right ?
it UNknown because hey saw pictures of hot girls
you can go anywhere on the internet and see pictures of hot girls
im not talking UNknown a dating site
im talking about taking the entire social experience of college
im totally UNknown about this to eduardo
its like final club but were president
i told him i thought it sounded great was a great idea
there was nothing to hack people were gonna provide their own pictures their own information
and people would have the ability to invite or not invite their UNknown to join
in a world were social UNknown was everything
it was a big project and he was going to have to write UNknown of thousands lines of code
so i was wondering why he was coming to me and not his UNknown
UNknown UNknown chris hughes they were UNknown
were gonna need a little start up cash to rent a server to get it online
well split it 70 30
i said lets do it
why you think he said that ?
gretchen excuse me for UNknown UNknown discovery is this
i know you UNknown e done your homework and know money is not a big part of my life
but at the moment i could buy mount UNknown street take the UNknown club and turn it into my UNknown pong room
i UNknown l let you know how the party ends
we recognise UNknown a plaintiff in one suit involving facebook
at any time in the weeks prior to mark telling you his idea
he said they asked him to work on their site
but that he looked at what they had and decided it UNknown worth his time
he said even his most pathetic UNknown knew about getting people interested in the UNknown then these guys
yes he resented mark resented that they your clients that he thought that he needed to UNknown his image after UNknown
mark didnt want to UNknown anything with UNknown
hacked into the harvard computers he blew his nose at the add board
he got alot of UNknown UNknown did exactly what he wanted to do
were you aware that while mr UNknown was UNknown the UNknown he was also UNknown UNknown the UNknown
not at the time i UNknown
it really did not have much to do with the UNknown dating site
how would you know you were 'n t even there
were you aware that while mr UNknown was building the UNknown
he was leading the UNknown to believe he was building the harvard connection
conclusion not found in evidence
we are about to find this new evidence

i can do a UNknown job then they can and i gave
as of yesterday evening UNknown said that over 650 students registered to use the facebook com
he said that he anticipated 900 would join by this morning
yes he was just reading that 650 students signed up for it on the 1st day
god if i was a drug dealer i could not give free drugs to 650 people in a day
this guy doesnt have 3 UNknown to rub together to make a fourth
allright yes UNknown what well do mr hotchkiss well put it all together and well e mail it to you

we dont know that hes not a good guy
we know he stole our idea
we know lied to our faces for a month and a half
no he never lied to our face
ok he never saw our faces fine he lied through our e mail accounts
and he gave himself a 42 day head start
because he knows and apparently you dont
which is that getting there first is everything
that was your father 's lawyer ?
he is going to look at all this and if he thinks its appropriate hes going to send a cease and UNknown letter
what you want to hire an ip lawyer and sue him ?
no i want to hire the UNknown to beat the shit out of him with a hammer
we can do that ourselves
i m 6 5 220 and theres 2 of us
well whatever im saying lets calm down until we know what were talking about
how much more information are you waiting for
we met with mark 3 times we exchanged 52 e mails we can prove that he looked at the code
what is that on the bottom of the page
on the home page ?
they wrote UNknown said he hoped the privacy option would help restore his reputation following student out rage over UNknown com outrage committed after
exactly what we said to him
hes giving us the finger in the crimson
people know that this is in dispute
were not starting a knife fight in the crimson
say it why not ?
because we are gentlemen of harvard
this is harvard were you dont plant stories and you dont sue people
you thought he was UNknown be the only one that thought that was stupid ?
during the time when you say you had this idea
did you know UNknown and cameron came for a family of means ?
a family of means ?
did you know their father was wealthy ?
i not sure why your asking me that
its not important that you be sure why i am asking
did you know that they came from money ?
i had no idea weather they came from money or not
in one of your lead ups mr UNknown you UNknown howard UNknown consulting firm
howard UNknown founded a firm whose assets are in the hundreds of millions
you also knew tyler and cameron were members of the harvard finals club called the UNknown

and mark was the biggest thing on campus ?
that included 19 nobel UNknown and 15 pulitzer prize winners
two future UNknown and a movie star
who is the movie star ?
i am a christy this is alice
because first she said on the facebook to find her
the second is that we can all go out for a drink
for 2 reasons 1 cause she likes facebook and the other
they want to have drinks later
have you ever heard so many good things packed into one regular sized sentence
how are you doing ?

what were their names ?
i said its time to UNknown the site
what does that mean ?
it means its time for the web site generate revenue
well we got 4000 members
because facebook is a cool
and if we start selling pop ups for mountain dew

we dont even know what it is yet what it is
we dont know what it can be we dont know what it will be we know that its cool that is a priceless asset im not giving up
so when will it be finished
thats the point the way fashion never finishes fashion fashion is never finished

its called a cease and UNknown letter ?
when did you get this ?
about ten days ago right after we launched the site

it was UNknown to me
their saying we stole the facebook from david UNknown and the UNknown twins
dont screw around with me now
the letter said we could face legal action
no it says i could face legal action
this from a lawyer mark they must feel they have some grounds
the lawyer is their fathers house counsel
do they have grounds ?
the grounds are our thing is cool and popular and harvard connection is lame
UNknown i didnt use any of their code i UNknown i didnt use anything
look a guy who builds a nice chair doesnt owe money to everyone UNknown ever built a a chair
look they came to me with an idea i had a better one
why dont you show me this letter ?
i didnt think it was a big deal
if theres ever anything wrong
im the guy that wants to help
what are we doing about this ?
i went to UNknown student legal services and they told me to write them back
and what did you say ?
when we met in january i expressed my doubts about the site were it stood with UNknown how much UNknown was left that i had not anticipated
lack of hardware we had UNknown use and promotion and the to go on to UNknown launch the web site
this is your first time to you raised any of those concerns right
UNknown that 's all gentlemen
you sent my client sent 16 UNknown
the first 15 you didnt raise any concerns
is that a question ?
in the 16th UNknown you raised concerns about site UNknown
do you think i deserve your full attention
you have part of my attention you have the minimum amount
the rest of my attention is back at the offices of facebook
were my colleagues and i are doing thing that no one in this room including and especially your clients are UNknown or UNknown capable of doing

thats why i wanted to talk to you
that is why i came over

i did 'n t end up doing that
did 'n t stop you from writing it
its as if every thought that UNknown through your head is so clever
it would be a crime for it not to be shared
the UNknown not written in pencil mark
and you published erika UNknown is a bitch
right before you made an ignorant crack about my families name
and bra size then rated women based on their UNknown
erica is there a problem

your a UNknown not technically
UNknown not a lot of money in free music and even less if your being sued by anyone UNknown won a UNknown

or or UNknown use will result in UNknown action including required UNknown from the college you UNknown that instead of doing what what my brother came and
i i i saw him and i know he saw me i went after him and he UNknown
what my brother means is
i honestly dont think your in any position to make that call
i was the us treasury secretary
im in some position to make that call
harvard UNknown believe that inventing a job is better then finding a job is better then finding a job
so i suggest again that the 2 of you come up with a new new project
im saying that really sir
ann how did i get this appointment
let me tell you something mr UNknown UNknown mr UNknown since your on the subject of right and wrong
the 2 of you being here is wrong
its not worthy of harvard
its not what harvard saw in you
you dont get special treatment
UNknown UNknown start another project
like were UNknown a UNknown for a science fair
if you have a problem with that mr UNknown
we never asked for special treatment
the courts UNknown at your disposal
i UNknown a 335 year old door knob
what was the purpose of the trip
how did you feel the meetings went went terribly why
i was not asleep can i UNknown my answer
i wish he was asleep
what sound are you making is that like a tick
it was setup through my UNknown at the time
are you gonna talk about adds again
unless your the ballet theatre of hartford the purpose of business is to make a profit
he started UNknown when he was 19
he is not a god
i think your just jealous
i honestly was 'n t jealous
i did 'n t know him at all
but i had done a search and asked around and he
he crashed out of 2 pretty big internet companies in spectacular fashion and hes got a reputation with drugs
he also founded the companies
you must be eduardo and christy and mark
could you bring out UNknown the UNknown pork with that ginger UNknown
tuna tartar and the lobster claws that UNknown l get us started
christie what do you like to drink
an UNknown great 4 of those
from that point on it was a UNknown
the question was what did you talk about
he took through his episode with UNknown
i did 'n t want to spend my 20 's as a UNknown defender
who knew that in the UNknown of UNknown
they tried to sell the company to pay the 35 million they said we owed in UNknown but i guess to them that was a little like
selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas
so we said screw it and declared bankruptcy
you made a name for yourself
so let me tell you what happened to a 20 year old the top of the dot com
we got that on the record
your not a psychiatrist but what a psychiatrist would say that he was paranoid
they hired private detective who followed me day and night
there were targets for high UNknown escorts
i cant prove it but i know they tapped my phone
there UNknown l be UNknown in case i bought down the record companies with UNknown and retribution for UNknown to
you want to buy tower record eduardo
put the facebook on those UNknown first
pretty soon all the UNknown kids were seeing their UNknown on our site and we were in
its called the little UNknown its smart mark
hey you know what settle an UNknown for us
i say its time to start making money through the facebook but mark does 'n t want to advertise UNknown right well neither of you yet
its like your throwing the greatest party on campus and someone saying its gotta be over by 11 you dont even know what the thing is yet
how big it can get how far it can go
this is no time to put your chips down
you ever walk into a den and see a picture of him standing next to 14 trout
ok we all know that UNknown dont really UNknown 300 pounds right
have you seen the big ones up close
no i have 'n t but looking at the guy holding a UNknown the size of a UNknown that would be a really big fish and a very strong guy
i think you might be getting away from the point
i dont have a dog in this fight i just came to say hi
he owned mark after that dinner
he picked up the check and he told mark that they would talk together soon and he was gone but not before he made his biggest contribution to the company
drop the the just facebook
thats gotta be some kind of UNknown record for talking
you want to end the party at 11
im trying to pay for the party there wont be a party unless its cool
yeah sure lets drop the the
i meant catching the UNknown instead of 14 trout does 'n t that sound good
i UNknown l UNknown and that was UNknown UNknown
do you have anything here
you were accused of animal cruelty
i cant have this eduardo
oh come on man this is bullshit it another club playing a prank
i 'd gotten into the UNknown as as part of my UNknown i had to for 1 week carry with me at all times and take care of a chicken
they identified you as 1 of the UNknown of facebook jr eduardo UNknown
im not the expert but i think torturing animals was bad for business
i did not torture the chicken i dont torture chickens are you crazy no now settle down please
i have here an article from the UNknown
i was having dinner at the UNknown dining hall with mark and i had the chicken with me cause i had to have the chicken with me at all times
somebody is going to have to answer for this
the dining hall was serving chicken for dinner so i had to feed my chicken so wha i took little pieces of chicken and i gave it to the chicken
someone must have seen cause the next thing i knew i was accused of forced UNknown
i did 'n t know you could 'n t do that
i dealt with various animal rights groups
i dealt with the associate dean at the college this was all resolved
someone from the fly or the UNknown must have reported it for all i know it was the UNknown 's allright lets just forget about it
im being accused of animal cruelty next i UNknown l be accused of UNknown
it is better to be accused of UNknown
im gonna have to explain this to my father im UNknown have to explain this to everybody what is UNknown on that
i have my final coming up for post war and contemporary art and i UNknown been to class
im supposed to write about those 4 paintings
i put it under an UNknown
i posted the paintings and asked people to comment
every once in awhile i hop and stir the pot to get a good debate going
was mr UNknown cheating on his final exam
i d rather not answer that question and why not cause im not suing him for cheating on his final exam
you told your lawyer i was torturing animals
no he did 'n t tell us about it at all our UNknown are capable of finding a UNknown article
in fact when we raised the subject he defended you
so 993 we are so close
oh yeah that remind me were gonna need more money
i UNknown more UNknown UNknown
im interviewing 2 UNknown to come to paulo alto and we are going to have to pay them something sorry what
i already found a house for rent on a street 2 blocks from the stanford campus its perfect and its gotta pool
when did you decide to go to UNknown for the summer
you mean when did i actually decide
somewhere in the middle of the sean parker variety UNknown
he was right california is the place we gotta be
what you got the beverly hill UNknown in UNknown
what is your problem with sean
he doesnt bring anything to the table doesnt have money UNknown a better UNknown
hes got connections got connections to UNknown
if we need UNknown i have connections to UNknown
the real players and as someone UNknown just really UNknown the company in a bad way
it was the UNknown 's mark
you dont think it was strange that he was followed by private detectives
who came up with nothing enough to get him out of the company the drugs the girls
we dont know if any of thats true
read about it and i can read about you torturing birds since when does reading about something dont eat other fish the UNknown and the trout
im UNknown UNknown at 10 UNknown night in the UNknown lab get onboard with this man you know
i dont really know what else to say
all behind a UNknown UNknown UNknown UNknown UNknown the beauty
you know i did 'n t understand anything you just said right
i also have a program running that has a pop up window appear simultaneously on all 5 computers
the last candidate to hit the window has to take a shot
plus every 3 minutes they all have to take a shot
can i ask what part of the UNknown job will they need to be able to do drunk
your right a more UNknown test would be seeing if they can keep a chicken alive for a week
i opened a new UNknown and put 1800 dollars in it will that get you through the summer
a total of 19 000 dollars then
i got the same thing
after expressing UNknown about mr UNknown taking the company and moving it to california for the summer why did you put UNknown dollars in the account for his use
i figured we were partners
i wanted to be a team player
i figured mark UNknown and the new UNknown could work on the site while i was UNknown UNknown interest in new york
but mostly i figured how much could possibly go wrong in 3 months
ok ready sounds like an eight
that was like a 2
i did 'n t know we had a doorbell
was UNknown hurt you look
this is my sharon she lives right across the street
i was helping her move out we saw the chimney

but shes done for the summer so shes back at her parents UNknown and im homeless

happy ending right 2 years later the company is worth 500 million dollars and roy raymond jumps off the golden gate bridge
i date victoria secret models thats why shen looks familiar to you
dont be impressed UNknown all this i read your UNknown

in five minutes this room will fill up and you 'r e all gonna drown in kitty litter !
bet you weren 't expecting that suckers !
i 'm long gone !
outside safe and sound while you losers are in here trapped in a rising tide of
get me out of here !
we can get out the window !
if we all work together we can reach it
we UNknown l form a dog cat pyramid
you step on my back catherine will step on yours
she UNknown l scratch me
how about i get on her back ?
why don 't you just try it and see what happens ?
why can 't you go in the yard like a normal animal ?
like a dog rushing in without thinking
did you see that ?
start talking or these dogs are gonna rip into you like a bag of UNknown
look i don 't know where kitty is but i can tell you this
and they fly them to a secret location
how would i know ?
sounds like she 's building something
who can understand the mind of a crazy old cat ?
i know a crazy old cat
this cat is nuts but he might lead us to kitty
if i grow any hair i am leaving
i can 't do hair and feathers
don 't leave me !
oh how cute he hearts his mommy
we need the UNknown of your twisted mind to locate kitty galore
lf you were to build a doomsday device
you UNknown l never find love you know
i can tell by the way you 'r e sitting
so apart from the others
spying on your own brothers and sisters ?
but that takes a very special kind of UNknown
someone dedicated driven and very angry
who 's your daddy catherine ?
and after all these years still only a field agent ?
listen here you UNknown cat
we 'r e here to talk about kitty galore
who the heck are you ?
that bulge under your left ear
you were UNknown with a UNknown UNknown
i 'm guessing police work
my my so young to be dismissed from the force
tell me officer do you hate me ?
what color am i thinking of ?
the last bird who stood this close to me well i enjoyed his company with a plate of fancy feast and a nice saucer of milk
i was thinking of blue creepy mcgee
hey kitty i got news
what is the world coming to ?
cats and dogs can 't work together !
time to call in the macdougall twins
i always wondered what UNknown would look like in a dress
betrayed by my own kind
i have got a surprise for you !
for our big opening you are gonna go in here like this
sword a into slot b
the crowd UNknown and UNknown as i put sword d into slot seven ?
enough pussy footing around tinkles !
you guys are no fun
look i can 't help you fight other villains all right ?
it 's a professional courtesy thing
i 'd be UNknown laughed at
i 'd lose my pension
however i will say this
what 's that supposed to mean ?
it 's a riddle sherlock
i was trying to be mysterious
for the great tinkles ?
an evil genius doesn 't need good luck
what was tinkles talking about ?
a cat 's eye reveals everything
that don 't even make no sense
tinkles doesn 't know where kitty galore is
he 's UNknown he 's UNknown
in other words your typical UNknown
UNknown is chasing a ball when it 's just gonna be thrown again
the game of fetch is one of the most exciting outdoor sports this side of squirrel chasing
would you two please muzzle it ?
what 's happening angus ?
duncan would you be quiet !
after the mission can we get ice cream ?
yes yes yes we can get ice cream
butch if you 'r e not too busy
i UNknown l use my UNknown
we got a doggy overboard !
we UNknown l call dr phil later
but right now i need some help
and you 'r e lucky i don 't smack you upside your cat head
now don 't be hasty dog
your mission is still to protect me !
catherine snap out of it
i UNknown e never seen so much of it
oh god i can 't even look at it
i wanna help you but
where 's kitty galore ?
preparing the call of the wild
soon your feeble UNknown brains will feel her wrath and UNknown will crumble !
your UNknown days are over bird
i said stand down !
you UNknown e ruined everything
first you let the carrier pigeon get away
then you almost drowned us in kitty litter
and now you UNknown e let the UNknown escape !
well i didn 't blow up the ferry
i mean that 's something
i UNknown e had it with you
i told lou you didn 't have what it takes to be an agent and i was right
what are you saying ?
i 'm saying go home UNknown
you 'r e off this team
i don 't wanna be rude but the bird 's still all good right ?
we UNknown e got work to do
i UNknown l catch up with you
you don 't have to pretend to check in with meows just so you can thank me for saving your life
but i um also want to thank you for saving my life
hey you 'r e hurt
well too bad tough guy
you 'r e coming with me to get fixed up
i 'm running out of time
where is that stupid pigeon ?
hey there 's my cat
what do you say there kitty ?
and where have you been ?
this computer chip is the last piece i need
my humans are out tonight so relax while i check in with meows
just one paw after the other
auntie catherine brought home a friend
catherine could you help me out here ?
is it true there 's a spot on your tummy and if i tickle it your foot will shake ?
oh boy that 's it
now let 's have a look at that paw
my nieces are tougher than that
yeah they 'r e unbelievable
i mean i 'm a dog
i can 't believe they don 't hate me
well i guess they haven 't learned to yet
anyway listen thanks for fixing me up
i should be heading home now
so where do you live ?
oh uh well it was over at the
you know i 'm kind of between homes right now so i UNknown l probably just
i UNknown l just head back to the kennel
UNknown how much time have you spent in UNknown ?
i guess i was just a pup when i first got dropped off
my owner said he 'd be right back but
well how did you finally get out ?
i guess he saw something in me nobody else did
and i swore i was never gonna let him down
there was no way i was ever gonna wind up in the kennel again
i wound up in the kennel again
no matter how hard i try i just keep messing things up
uh could all of this have something to do with not being able to follow an order to save your life ?
but it 's not like i don 't wanna follow orders
it 's just i learned pretty early on that the only one i could count on the only one i could really trust was me
that way no one could ever let me down
a room full of cats ?
try and stop me !
oh man here we go again
this is not an emergency sir
you still have seven lives left
okay UNknown no barking no drooling and definitely no chasing my colleagues
guys please can you stop running ?
i 'm fighting the urge to chase you
no no tab he 's cool
i feel like an idiot up here
does he look UNknown to you ?
he looks UNknown to me
well i UNknown l be
so who 's up for a corn dog ?
can i ask you something ?
don 't take this wrong
you know that saying cat got your tongue ?
no UNknown i drive like a cat
this place looks pretty secure
i know what to do
we haven 't got much time
catherine i sure hope we 'r e not chasing our tails here
is this what it 's come to darlings ?
cats and dogs working together ?
call me old fashioned but i preferred it when we all hated each other
let 's see some thread some UNknown a rubber band
scratch that two rubber bands !
this is my house !
you UNknown l ruin this place
my insurance doesn 't cover this
this is why my landlord said no pets
well always great having you over butch
you 'r e the life of the party
that 's a blueprint for a giant satellite dish
this is worse than we thought !
she 's trying to get free UNknown
this is why kitty 's after you
hq you getting this ?
that thing is three stories tall
if this device is real it 's our worst fears come true
we just picked up a distress signal from catherine
they were chasing a lead on kitty 's hideout a place called UNknown
you 'r e looking for one chuck the magnificent
tab i 'm sending you a blueprint
butch go get our agent
so this is how it ends for me
in a circus tent chained to a cat
don 't judge my master plan until you UNknown e heard the whole thing huh ?
you see in 20 minutes i will begin broadcasting the call of the wild !
and every UNknown on this planet will become a mad dog forever !
i was worried the whole thing was a UNknown complicated
let 's show our friends what we have up our UNknown sleeve
a dog 's sensitive hearing has always been considered a tactical advantage
look at the little doggy losing control
they 'r e even turning on their owners
humans have no idea what 's happened
their dogs have all gone mad !
yes yes the UNknown !
where they will be forever alone UNknown unloved
seem familiar officer UNknown ?
but there 's a lot of dogs in this world
what are you gonna do go door to door with your sound ?
that would take you the rest of your nine lives
unless i had a satellite
why do you think i UNknown e been telling you this ?
i got time to kill until my satellite 's in position
then once i beam the signal it will instantly broadcast from every tv radio and cell phone on earth !
you UNknown l never get away with this kitty !
i was hoping someone would say i UNknown l never get away with this
it UNknown l make it so much more satisfying when i do !
now sit back and relax
i don 't want you to swim
we 'r e almost at UNknown
oh if there 's one ride we should go on it 's the roller coaster
we 'r e not going on any rides
i know it 's uncomfortable but i think we 'r e buds
i feel so free !
i can use your collar !
no it doesn 't do anything
it 's not even good for fleas
no if i could just get it loose i can pick the lock
i 'm not leaving you UNknown
oh you owe me UNknown dog
sorry practice went a little long
where are you girl ?
chuck you 'r e a grade a UNknown
we all get stage fright sometimes
we can get through this together
the show must go on !
you have any idea what the street value of that is ?
where could kitty be hiding that satellite dish ?
you can 't just hide something like that
is there a height UNknown for this ride ?
scratch that disc i scratch you
excuse me has anyone seen my assistant ?
she kind of looks like a raw chicken
let 's get this party started
what in the world ?
why am i doing this ?
the satellite is almost in position
it looks like an off switch
what are you doing ?
i can 't reach it !
not every red button is an off switch
butch are you there ?
we UNknown e lost hq !
and don 't scratch it !
what do you say catherine ?
feel like going for a ride ?
i know what i want for christmas
like my new invention ?
amazing what you can do with a few spare parts and a thirst to destroy mankind
we 'r e seconds away from a world full of barking mad UNknown
and you 'r e too late to stop it !
the call of the wild has hit london new york albuquerque !
that leaves less than a minute till it 's overhead
we 'r e almost at the wires !
something 's wrong with my collar !
i hate plan b !
that was your plan to stop me ?
when this is over you UNknown l be the first to be locked up
sister this dog is never going back to the UNknown
thank you san francisco !
do you feel that kitty ?
i 'm glad to see you too buddy !
well there 's my big boy
how did you get here ?
hey UNknown listen to me
i am so sorry that i didn 't stick up for you more
i promise that will never happen again
honey you 'r e not gonna believe who i just found
looks like someone made a new best friend
he 's like a new dog
think he misses being a cop ?
trust me honey excitement 's the last thing on his mind
our UNknown 's been UNknown
how 's that even possible ?
only one mastermind could do that
we got work to do
you guys ready to do this ?
work with a bunch of dogs again ?
we 'r e talking about lunch right ?
centurion UNknown it 's too damn cold to be standing watch
it 's not my watch
i 'm just wondering what 's out there
the patrol returns at dawn
bell rings man come on !
you put up a good fight now you drink with me
you 'r e a drunk
isn 't ten times enough to know when you 'r e beaten ?
what are you waiting for an order ?
get stuck in there !
damn that UNknown l sober a man up quick !
when will people learn not to fuck with the ninth ?
some say it 's irregular for you to be seen drinking with the men of the legion
UNknown my old friend they forget
i am a man of the legion
soldier have you been fighting ?
i have a message for your general
now point me in his direction before i have you flogged
i 'm the personal envoy of governor UNknown
i suggest you get down off that horse and give me your message before i have you flogged !
it would be my pleasure
UNknown is UNknown the ninth
we 'r e going to war UNknown
alert the senior UNknown to break camp and prepare the men
return to UNknown at once
what does UNknown intend for my people ?
when will he send his armies north ?
i am a soldier of rome !
i will not yield !
rome will make you bleed for this
i don 't care how you do it but wipe them out
and bring UNknown before me in chains
governor you 'r e the politician i 'm just a simple soldier
but i 'm not so simple that i can 't see you 'r e looking for a way back to rome
my bones ache for rome
let us be frank general
the conquest of britain is a lost cause
with one bold stroke we could change all that
with the ninth legion at your command we can crush this enemy
you and your men could retire with wealth and honour
my men have honour enough
to kill the snake you have to cut off its head
i need to find UNknown
general UNknown meet UNknown my UNknown UNknown
can 't speak a word but she can hunt anything over any terrain
i swear she 's part wolf
i apologise for the UNknown but i wanted to prove a point
i don 't know whether to fight her or
she 's mute not deaf !
i have my own scouts
UNknown not like her !
knows their ways knows their UNknown
what 's she sitting over there for ?
she 's been looking at you all night
i UNknown e spotted it
can 't take her eyes off you
she 's speechless you daft bastard
she 's got no tongue in her head you fool
i wouldn 't get too close
no tongue that 's perfect she UNknown l have more room for this
UNknown i think that 's UNknown for fuck off
she must be a good scout if she can find your cock
i think it 's love
three UNknown riders and another a prisoner on foot
i think he might be roman
UNknown centurion remus take the column !
we UNknown l get nothing out of him
we can 't take prisoners on the march
you know what to do
thank the gods you found me
not the gods you should thank
what 's your name soldier ?
inch UNknown il frontier garrison
well sorry we couldn 't get here sooner
i 'm titus flavius UNknown commander of the ninth legion
we UNknown e come here looking for a fight
now you look like a roman
how do you feel ?
nothing that won 't heal in time
well sometimes there are scars that cannot be seen
you escaped the clutches of UNknown but i must ask you to return with us into the lion 's den
best to get back into the fight general
my father was UNknown UNknown
i saw him win the fight that earned him his freedom
he taught me how to fight when to choose my battles
get this man a drink
i think he deserves it
tomorrow you ride by my side
i can 't understand a word of these UNknown
i UNknown e never seen a general so beloved of his men
well in training he is our scholar at the feast he is our father in the ranks he is our brother
and in battle he is the god we pray to save our souls
where did you read that ?
it 's written on the UNknown wall sir
he 's a ruthless reckless bastard
and i 'd die for him without hesitation
UNknown it 's a trap !
quintus ride to the rear
tell centurion remus to pull the column back
we UNknown e got to move
thank the gods some of us made it
UNknown junior scout and UNknown
are we all that 's left ?
we need to find the general 's body
he deserves a nobler tomb than this
the general 's still alive
i saw them take him away in chains
you would go after the UNknown ?
they UNknown l have patrols sweeping these forests for survivors
we might as well slit our throats
where did you come from ?
i 'm not a soldier i 'm a cook
UNknown what you can food supplies weapons
UNknown he used to be a marathon runner before he joined up
how do you know that ?
i knew we should never have trusted that bitch
they can kill you in minutes
but it 's not my real name
it was given to me
what 's your real name ?
i doubt you could pronounce it
it 's from the mountains of the hindu UNknown where i was born
move closer to the fire
where are you from UNknown ?
i 'm from the army
it 's all i UNknown e ever known
they picked me up from the street trained me told me i could better myself
i escaped with my life by running from UNknown
didn 't stop until i reached greece
then i ran for sport
now i 'm running for my life again
we 'r e all a long way from home
this was supposed to be my last tour
what kind of name is that anyway ?
your mother must have been wise
quintus brick it is then
where are my men ?
she would answer your charge but she cannot speak
do you know why ?
she was a child when she came to us seeking sanctuary
her own village had been slaughtered as punishment for resisting roman rule
to set an example they burnt out her father 's eyes
they raped her mother until she was begging to die
UNknown was forced to watch before she too was raped
and finally they cut out her tongue that she may not speak ill of the bloody roman empire
she fled north and came to us for shelter
we raised her and made her one of our own
quintus the army is still UNknown
we will not abandon you sir
that 's for the ninth
had to take care of a small problem
i UNknown e got the general 's helmet
see what you have done ?
before you die know that the men who did this will not live to tell your tale
well let 's get on with it then
well what are you waiting for ?
do you fear me ?
we need to keep moving while we have the lead
on foot over this ?
where they may hesitate we must go
but our lines are to the south
and that 's where they UNknown l be looking for us
look we can 't outrun them
so we have to outsmart them
we head north throw them off our trail then double back west then south
it may take days even weeks
but we 'r e so far behind enemy lines it 's our only chance of getting home
you UNknown l be needing this then centurion
i can 't go on i 'm too cold
he 's slowing us down
just say the word and i UNknown l take care of it
we live united or die divided starting with you
you can stick this out if you want but first chance i get i 'm taking care of myself
drink while it 's hot
the moss inside is half UNknown
they UNknown l have heard him from miles away
come on let 's go
come on get up !
they 'r e coming !
give me your hand !
are you out of your mind ?
brick are you ok ?
they UNknown e followed us downstream
how can she do that ?
it 's not magic she 's a UNknown
and she 's UNknown of us
they 'r e making camp across the valley
they don 't care if we know where they are
but she won 't expect it us
what are you going to do ?
they had the same idea as you
they 'r e not defending their lives or their country any more
they UNknown e sworn a blood vengeance against us
and they won 't rest until we beg them for death
are you ready to get on your knees and beg ?
hopeless is what they sing songs about write poems about
hopeless is the stuff of legend UNknown
what do i have to do ?
keep moving while we still have darkness on our side
the gods have forsaken us
i can 't keep up
don 't cry out UNknown
they UNknown l end it quicker if you don 't cry out
we should give this place a wide berth
we need food and a place to rest
where the hell are we now ?
i UNknown l leave you to it then
are you from the garrison ?
two days south of here
how do you think i know your language ?
i do what i can to discourage them
they think i 'm a UNknown and they leave me alone
it usually works on the others
we 'r e too tired to be afraid
brick put the fucking knife down
UNknown there 's a roman garrison two days from here
it must be the western frontier post at UNknown
let 's take a look at your friend
quintus what 's she doing ?
she 's a UNknown and a woman
right that UNknown l stop the bleeding
well how 's your leg ?
has our witch worked her magic ?
she 's trying to poison us
why heal your leg only to kill you ?
death caps have white gills
your men are very nervous
a demon UNknown us day and night
if UNknown is hunting you you might as well be dead already
her soul is an empty vessel
she went to fetch us some breakfast
is that for bait ?
where i come from it 's considered rude to interrupt a man UNknown
groans too late for that
we put you in too much danger
leave now and she UNknown l have you UNknown and skinned before nightfall
stay until morning and your friend will be fit to travel
they are not my people
i 'm a UNknown old soldier but not too stubborn to admit when i 'm wrong
i 'm sorry i misjudged you
i owe allegiance to no man but to whom i choose
see the fire 's burning
emperor UNknown has given orders to form a new defensive line to the south
giving up the ground we fought for
how does she do that ?
i don 't know about you but i 'm tired of running
this is all i could find
brick UNknown they 'r e UNknown us
how much further do you think ?
that 's close enough UNknown
i thought you were UNknown
UNknown we thought you were dead
are we all that 's left ?
hey at least the three of us made it !
we 'r e not home yet
what are you talking about ?
so rome 's finally given up on this UNknown of a country then ?
can 't say that i 'm sorry
what happened with the boy UNknown ?
i UNknown e no idea what you 'r e talking about
this is UNknown 's big fucking plan ?
UNknown what are you doing ?
just making sure that we understand each other
i understand that many good men died because of what you did and you will answer for it
UNknown this report confirms our worst fears
you fought your war soldier and earned the gratitude of rome
this man will show you to my private quarters he will see you fed
we cannot return to rome in disgrace
better that the fate of the legion remain a mystery than the truth of their failure be known
if word gets out every tribe and every nation will rise against us
it 's too great a risk
are we agreed then ?
i hope the food is to your liking
i UNknown e brought you some wine
it is the least we can do for a hero of rome
is this how rome honours her heroes ?
you want to bury the truth and me along with it ?
you are too much of a risk
where will you go ?

oh but you 'r e gonna have so much fun in milan
you know j lo and marc anthony UNknown there last year
it 's up the street from lake como where george UNknown has a villa
he hates when i talk about this
oh and tom cruise got married there too
well i don 't understand why you had to rent it for a whole weekend
because it 's a holiday
they won 't rent it to you for one night
that 's nice of you
it was nice of us
it 's your money too isn 't it ?
yeah it 's your money it 's his money it 's my money

i think i just sat on your adding machine
now i know what happened to the fish tank
coach robert the buzzer UNknown was a caretaker by profession
what a wonderful word to describe his devotion to his fellow man
when robert knew that his time was short he told me there was one specific man he wanted to say a few words to UNknown him
so i 'd like to ask lenny UNknown to come up now
i 'm sorry i 'm not prepared at all
i feel very honoured that coach asked me to do this but
i also feel terrible because i haven 't seen the coach in so long
i mean believe it or not robbie and marcus were actually shorter back in UNknown
but those guys had a skill you never mastered
they knew how to pass the ball
looks like somebody has to learn how to pass the kentucky fried chicken

you affected everybody in this room
and i hope we get to live our lives like you

right here on this island where we hid from our parents and where we 'r e hiding from our wives and children
goodbye to you friend wise advice UNknown
i really messed up my marriages
it was my fault man
i just couldn 't hang on
you know my own daughters i don 't even hardly know them
you got time to patch things up with your daughters
you just call them when you get back
actually they 'r e gonna be here in about 20 minutes
i can use a piece of chicken
actually i 'm still gonna eat it
how do you get that
ninety five percent of that 's gotta be from the mother
the elvis hairs are going up her nose
she doesn 't know what to do
is this your car ?
my old man lent me this UNknown
because he doesn 't care if i break down in the middle of nowhere and get eaten by a bear
what does that mean ?
i don 't know but it feels right
i hope that car never gets fixed
i don 't think it will
we 'r e all looking at the same time
let 's at least take shifts
UNknown you and me look at the tree
what are we doing ?
oh look here comes grandma gloria to the rescue
if you guys thought seeing them at the car was gross you should have heard that UNknown action
sounded like two UNknown fighting over a salmon
there was a lot happening
at least he 's getting something
i UNknown e been shut out since UNknown found out she was pregnant
you have sex when they 'r e pregnant ?
the baby thinks he 's getting a tootsie roll
i got lucky on saint paddy 's day but she was half asleep
and by half asleep i mean she was asleep
you 'r e allowed to do that
she 'd rather not be awake
but they pay with UNknown
was good hanging with you guys
we 'r e catching up
i 'm glad my family turmoil can provide entertainment for you guys
let 's cheer him up
how did we cheer robbie up in the old days ?
did we really do that ?
single stupidest thing we ever did
i can 't believe we 'r e doing this
how do we always let lenny talk us into the stupidest stuff ?
remember whoever stays in the circle the longest wins
i don 't like that part

these UNknown eggs would really be good if you had some UNknown sauce
all right here we go

so come on robbie tell the man what 's going on
gloria and i are thinking about having a baby
how great is that ?
you know the good news is she can 't get any more stretch marks
you see that 's just ugly
he doesn 't get it
he 's not in a committed relationship
he 's just mad because all the girls i go out with are 70 to 80 years younger than his wife
the last one i was with she 's blond she 's tall super hot
me and blondie we start going at it and we 'r e shaking the bed
what does shaking the bed mean ?
i don 't know i just know UNknown the bed
and then right at the good part you know ?
this picture behind right on the wall falls and goes
hits her on the forehead
i didn 't slow down
i just throw her two UNknown she UNknown on them like a frisbee dog
marcus your snoring kept me up all night long
you 'r e a dead man
that 's my baby girl
i thought you were my friend
why are you fighting ?
good to see midget wrestling again
how could you do that ?
shake the bed with her
you think i would do that to you ?
out of any of us you 'd be the one to do that
you did sleep with UNknown 's mother
i didn 't even know that guy
she grabbed my UNknown i told you guys
maybe i flirted with him but that was just to get your attention
well what about his snoring ?
we heard it from three rooms away
he 's off the hook
you know marcus wouldn 't be with your daughter
i mean not that she 's you know what i 'm saying
yeah dude that 's your daughter
i 'd never be with her
you 'r e my best friend man
and jasmine 'd never be with me because i 'm me
look sorry i don 't have my whole life together like lenny
i answered your phone UNknown
i asked him if he cancelled the flight to milan
before we even came here
so he just made that up huh ?
i 'm not saying he made it up
i 'm think in his head he believes it 's true
don 't you agent me lenny
stop trying to handle everybody and everything and start taking a little responsibility for once
i thought it would be better for our family to be here with normal people instead of going to milan
we 'r e normal ?
i was scared to tell you
it was easier for me to keep it a secret
you peel back any marriage there are secrets
mine is i love you
i love you very much
our kids are becoming nutty UNknown spoiled
we got a nanny we got so she is a nanny
she 's not a nanny
of course she 's a nanny
when does the lying stop ?
it stops right after this
she 's more of an au pair
i won 't lie to you ever again
they can 't help themselves
kurt sure as hell lies

i do not have a thing for the nanny
but did i enjoy a nice conversation with a woman that wasn 't going where 's this ? and did you pick up that ? yeah
you 'r e always working
and when you come home you 'r e just tired all the time
you barely even touch me or look at me
he sounds like an old woman
UNknown you should have married umberto UNknown like i told you
and if i had stayed with him you 'd be the one that 's pregnant now mama
look maybe i do take you for granted and i 'm sorry

i got laid off in april
you don 't have to hide anything from us
since we 'r e getting things off our chests here i got a confession to make
i have a confession to make
no i 'm just kidding
i 'm really a little hurt that so many of you believed it
i know it 's not my place but
well after all i am older than anyone here
well despite the joking and the UNknown i see a lot of love here
and with love comes hostility
like rob when he snapped at me the other day
and you all thought that i was so calm but inside ?
gloria UNknown do not call him a bug eyed UNknown with a little man complex
do not say that his hair makes him look like a dirty q tip
or that he resembles an elder gay jonas brother
they get the point of where you 'r e going
or a midget filipino UNknown
i didn 't say those things
life can be difficult sometimes
it gets bumpy what with family and kids and things not going exactly like you planned
but that 's what makes it interesting
in life the first act always exciting
the second act that 's where the depth comes in

the entire back half of the UNknown file has been blacked out
but there 's a list 11 names plus one that 's been UNknown

you know get to know UNknown
and i just wanted to tell you that in all the year 's i UNknown e know francis
i UNknown e never seen him like this
so if you break his heart i will kill you
oh this is going to be fun !
here at browning UNknown we have a long standing commitment to UNknown causes because UNknown corporate citizenship is our highest calling
as a company with global reach global interests
now sometimes i 'm asked if this commitment to ethical behavior affects the bottom line
this is my safe room
UNknown UNknown swept for bugs daily
i can not imagine a more perfect place to conduct our business
you do know that there is a UNknown
free arms delivery to countries that are UNknown by the united nations
UNknown only makes us what
how many UNknown 's can say that ?
so how did you guys meet ?
we started talking on the phone
i guess i liked that it wasn 't real
course now i 'm a fugitive the cla wants to kill me and i 'm hiding in a hole
you know i was in love with an agent once
well i was with UNknown and the relationship wasn 't UNknown
so when it came to light my loyalty was questioned
and i was ordered to kill him
what did you do ?
who the hell are you guys ?
you don 't remember us ?
you 'r e the guy who 's shit we cleaned up down in UNknown UNknown
who did you fly out of there ?
y you don 't have any idea what you 'r e getting into
first of all you can 't touch me
how much ten bucks ?
want nuts UNknown UNknown trainer
now you got something to say ?
we UNknown a young lieutenant
who was the son of the late senator james stanton
vice president of the united states
you 'r e saying the vice president killed all the people in that village ?
yeah went completely off the reservation
and that new york times reporter did she pressure you ?
yeah yeah she called me twice
so i called the UNknown
i made him vice president
and kept your mouth shut and the UNknown made you rich
i will pay whatever it costs to get rid of this thing
we 'r e not here for money homes
we 'r e here because that new york times reporter had that list of names of everybody who was in UNknown
i had nothing to do with that
don 't you see ?
he 's trying to clean up his past and get rid of me in one shot
he 's trying to cut me loose before he runs for president
we have some major activity out here
looks like we 'r e blown
we 'r e in positions perimeter is set
they 'r e moving a team up the east side
are you going to let me talk to them ?
thanks but when we want your help we UNknown l bring out the drain cleaner
those bastards probable have orders to kill me too
why UNknown UNknown i 'm a bad guy ?
you don 't have people killed
i have people killed i 'm the bad guy remember ?
how 's retirement frank ?
it 's been a real blast
if we have to come in there and get you it 's going to be messy
i UNknown e got my orders frank
they come from the vice president ?
he 's ordered these hits to cover the war crimes he 's UNknown while in UNknown
i find that hard to believe
how did you know you 'd find me here ?
some anonymous UNknown tip ?
here 's the deal frank
you 'r e gonna walk out that front door and give yourself up
you have my word no one will shoot you
i will personally take you in and you get to tell your side of the story
you got 60 seconds to decide
what 's it look like ?
there 's no clean exit
they seem to be coming from everywhere
we 'r e running out of options
if we have a distraction i could cover you to the woods
looks like there 's not alot of options kid
UNknown going to have to make the hard choice if we 'r e going to make it out of here alive
tell them to hold their fire
all units hold fire repeat all units hold fire
come out now i got you covered
who fired the shot ?
frank you 'r e no good to her dead
it 's nice to see you again ivan
did he just call you bunny ?
that didn 't work very well for the reporter
and what about frank 's girlfriend ?
they UNknown l kill her so fast i mean
first they UNknown l interrogate her they probably already got the wires then give her a little UNknown give her a jump
god you 'r e such an idiot !
i want to show you something
that has done to me by the love of my life
it seems that what we had was not meant to be
but now she sits outside my house drinking vodka
three bullets in the chest
i knew she still loved me
or else it would have been in the head
it was big risk for her of course but
one does crazy things for love
do not fear for your love my friend
with a small dedicated group there is nothing that cannot be accomplished
nobody knows you 'r e here
and unless you don 't cooperate fully there 's nothing i can 't do to you
moses is on the phone
here 's the thing cooper
with age comes a certain perspective
i 'd be a UNknown if i said there wasn 't a time that i was exactly like you
why are you telling me this ?
it might help me to decide what to do next
well what are you thinking about ?
our UNknown is very harmful
the killing the stress the bad pay didn 't bother me
well what was it frank ?
that anything that you love can be taken away from you
they tell you to never care never invest
and now you have her
i can 't think of anything more horrible than to know that your enemies can hurt someone that you love
the feeling is almost UNknown
you still there cooper ?
you 'r e in my house
almost UNknown isn 't it ?
please don 't hurt my family
if anything happens to sarah i will rip everything you love out of your life
and then i UNknown l kill you
i UNknown l do whatever you want to keep sarah safe
we don 't have much time
do you understand that ?
what are you going to do frank ?
i 'm going to kill the vice president
frank left this for me
where did he get it from ?
i know UNknown been right about a few things
but he 's about to cross the line from which there is no turning back
right now you have an opportunity to help him
you need to tell me everything you know
because if i can 't stop him i 'm going to have to kill him
do you know who frank moses is ?
