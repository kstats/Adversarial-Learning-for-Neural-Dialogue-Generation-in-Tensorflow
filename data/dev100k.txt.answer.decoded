it 's when you feel you 'r e getting close but you can 't make it
you 'r e not good enough
you 'r e not complete enough
and despite all your fantasies you 'r e second rate
it 's human
why not add that ?
it 's not important really
ultimately you 'r e judged by what you did not what you didn 't do
and i didn 't change things i just he just cheered people up
not bad that
they took 20 years to decide i can take another afternoon
suppose they start throwing things
now that would be a story

UNknown says i became learned at 10 self aware at 30 UNknown at 40 enlightened at 50 wise at 60 and UNknown at 70
knowing what you know and don 't know is knowing
what could he be like ?
probably nothing great
don 't be too nervous
just be your natural self
30 minutes left
UNknown said sandals need a match too
so don 't worry too much
UNknown said that too ?
instead of coffee have a drink with her okay ?
but it 's our first meet and it 's the daytime
the girl you UNknown l meet is very nice
but she likes to drink
well i wish you luck
sir you can do it !
i can do it !
why isn 't the elevator working ?
you 'r e telling me
my style is ruined for today
how many calories would six floors be ?
cut her leg off
i love you honey !
UNknown jin you UNknown e done it again
very good !
i take him to buddhist mass every morning
what 's wrong if he went on eight blind dates ?
he 's handsome and talented
regardless don 't count the last date
your son was an hour late last time
he hardly takes calls so it 's hard to fix a date
and he 's always late
i 'm sorry but i can 't cancel the last one
you can 't ?
ouch my head !
look here miss min ah !
your house is on fire !
ma 'a m
can 't you think of those dates as helping him with his karma ?
they say even a monk
without karma can 't be helped by buddha
call that working ?
is she trying to set a date
or find one herself ?
look at UNknown jin
learn from her
he UNknown l probably be late or won 't show up again
good luck UNknown jin
park hyun soo
if you show up late or not at all again
i 'm going to you personally
don 't forget about your date at six tonight
you 'r e scary UNknown jin
so what did he say ?
he didn 't answer so i left a message
where are you now ?
are you alright ?
sir you 'r e supposed to arrive on time and
next time watch how you dress
being well dressed for a date is polite
please hurry to your table
i UNknown l be going now
did you ask to see her again ?
park hyun soo
you said nice girls are your type
so what type is that ?
park hyun soo
anyway how could you drink so slow ?
are you okay ?
that 's okay it happens to me too
i see but
no your eyebrows
no i have a boyfriend
wanna see his picture ?
right kim UNknown jin
sorry i can 't remember things i don 't care about
don 't disgrace my job
i don 't look at my clients as men
that 's the ethics of my job
kim UNknown jin is number one !
don 't give me that job ethics crap
you only get to see your man once a week
he 's not good for you
a week is enough and i like it that way
what a career woman we have here
then take care of him at least
and listen to me carefully
if people our age don 't have someone something 's wrong
you know like if they 'r e really ugly
or if something 's really wrong with their personality
come to think of it they are
how come they look like that ?
they look like singles eyebrows
look at you
that 's nonsense
grateful huh ?
we UNknown e been able to keep our frail friendship for 20 years
you picked on me ever since primary school
come here look over there
look at your face
don 't worry
UNknown jin sure you UNknown l be okay ?
remember i said i UNknown l marry you if you don 't by thirty
so what now ?
see you later !
what 's with the air gun ?
who was it ?
why 'd she want the air gun ?
look at you
i 'm gonna kill you
before you take action don 't you need a drink first ?
how about UNknown ?
you UNknown l muster up more courage
think so ?
the odds are greater for a woman over thirty
to get hit by an atomic bomb than to find a nice man
you believe that ?
they 'r e right
UNknown jin how many bullets are there ?
one bullet maybe ?
if not then how could he love two women ?
the sun 's up
just tell him to get married
are my eyebrows weird ?
now that you mention it yes
should i slash my wrists ?
UNknown in !
and don 't worry
you 'r e UNknown
happy birthday !
who cares ?
he has a lot of work to do
so he 's coming over late
you 'r e lucky to have a guy like him
who comes all the way to seoul every weekend
but they say people look worse in person
so what are you gonna do ?
gonna see a midnight movie ?
actually i have something to tell you all
that you 'r e getting married ?
i 'm right huh ?
don 't say that it 's my birthday today !
i hate hearing that the most !
you guys have misunderstood me
i 'm not getting married
because i hate dealing with family customs
in other words marriage is business
no one has married because of real love
a woman who doesn 't want to marry is selfish
a guy who doesn 't is a playboy
that 's society 's prejudices
if we get involved
please check the number and try again
thanks for lunch
i 'm serious it UNknown l be my treat
kim UNknown in your eyebrows look better
who is she ?
are you serious ?
oh my goodness
you 'r e right who 's kim UNknown in ?

then you UNknown l be proposing to her out in the open
a propose to some lucky girl
there he goes

i looked all over for you
you dropped this
i UNknown e found a nice girl
introduce me to her
i UNknown l definitely set it up before i resign
kim UNknown jin
UNknown jin which side is the window on ?
to my left
that was the best event yet
an electric spark of love
anyway how many couples got UNknown ?
700 couples 70 percent
we UNknown l make big news tomorrow
but it wasn 't intentional
it was a definite accident
where are you going ?
hey i thought the boss was in love with you
you 'r e right
my company 's stocks are rock bottom
we 'r e in a lot of debt and near bankruptcy
but you already know my schools
my yearly salary
oh my goodness
oh no they 'r e holding hands !
slice it off !
it 's not a romantic comedy if they don 't kiss
they 'r e gonna do it !
i can 't see but i think they did !
but it 's important
this movie is over
oh yeah remember that great place ?
if you have some time
it would be nice if we could have a drink
i UNknown l treat you to a great time
UNknown UNknown rock music playing
open the register !
give me the keys now
no one was in any shape to talk so we 'r e pulling the security UNknown now
i UNknown l go find out what the victims were driving
well get an UNknown out on them if you get anything
not exclusively anyway
that 's just awful
buck likes UNknown ; he eats them frozen like UNknown
if she left prints they 'r e on the cash drawer
thanks for making the drive
i know we 'r e out of your UNknown
11 hits in the last 17 days
violent but strictly small time
and crossing state lines throws it to us
okay let me grab a coffee
i haven 't been able to get out ahead of them yet
there 's no rhyme or reason to their moves
they seem to go for whatever 's in front of them
and the girl 's a teacher ?
his father found out she 'd been UNknown
little buck 's morals since the homecoming game
only thing a teacher ever gave me was detention
yeah well however the conversation went
dad ended up with a full clip of UNknown ball ammo in his chest
just seems like a pretty extreme reaction
well look i mean she 's facing a UNknown rape charge
they tucked dad in buck 's garage hit the road started robbing their way across the country
what do you say guys ?
now if they 'r e lovers there 's gonna be a strong sexual UNknown to it also
yeah he 's 17 and take a look at her
still that 's a pretty big career change for a 30 year old teacher with no UNknown
actually crystal UNknown has a sealed juvenile record that the texas school system didn 't know about
track someone five six days you start getting hunches that you can 't exactly explain
mine says that she 's making her way back to your neighborhood
how about you and i go see if we can get these dots connected
well that 's a relief because it looks like your friend there was about to UNknown you
that 's right
with the UNknown energy of the hammer
charles i think the drama of demonstration would be most instructive here
you all right ?
he thinks they might be headed to l a
agent UNknown UNknown some UNknown about the UNknown approach to UNknown
and yet here you are
the instinct part of me says not to miss any bets
all right these dots representing ?
black are confirmed UNknown red are robberies yellow are killings
they 'r e hitting like every day or two then they fall off the grid they show up a couple hundred miles away
UNknown for us it 's easier to find pros
did you forget to mark a point here ?
a UNknown like UNknown maybe or
i just thought that there should be a point there
what you got a hunch ?
i don 't
knowledge plus a guess where i come from that 's a hunch
captioning sponsored by UNknown paramount network UNknown and presented to you by UNknown
she clears the register
that 's pretty sloppy though leaving this video
well unless it 's deliberate
i mean he fits the profile for the classic teenage thrill killer in which case all he wants is credit for every crime
she 's focused and intent
it says here she ran away from home at age 15 and came to los angeles
and that she got picked up 18 months later on a drug charge
18 months alone on the streets
it 's not hard to fill in those blanks
she goes to college she gets her teaching degree
and sex education for a high school senior
buck 's dad finds out about it
she 's facing exposure even prison
yeah but this response is totally UNknown to the UNknown
there 's something else
that 's a question only a 30 year old man would have to ask
i don 't know how he did it but he did
robbery on the 15th of this month
a bar outside of red desert wyoming
a couple fitting crystal UNknown and buck winters description hung around till closing time
they put the bartender in the hospital
they hit that gas station in colorado what was that like the 14th ?
i know the next UNknown was salt lake city the 17th
that 's plenty of time to cross in and out of wyoming
it fits the map and the UNknown
well maybe he didn 't want to brag about this one
could be they had friends close by somebody who could hide UNknown m out ?
yeah why don 't you check with the austin office see if either of them had any connections in wyoming
i mean maybe they called someone while they were sitting around
and the beach
sure baby i UNknown l take you to the beach
and that place with the footprints in the cement and the movie stars
i though you didn 't
what do you figure the boss drives ?
nicest car on the lot
not that difficult to find
either the living room of the kitchen
my accountant said i should UNknown
you know what they say about real estate
no what do they say ?
actually i don 't know
i UNknown e never owned anything but you know you read about the bubble
they say it can 't hurt to wait so
well you know actually um
it 's not about UNknown actually it 's uh
do you realize i haven 't lived by myself for over 40 years
i 'm considering it
well i UNknown e been making a list of all the things
i still want to do and
i would just like to do some things on my own
a and i would rather you didn 't
yeah well you 'r e on your own there
actually you should get one with a tennis court
i don 't play tennis
yeah but i do
take anything you want
hundred thousand dollar car
that 's not a secret
pile of dead bones
this is pierce brenner
sent all the employees home at 8 15 locked up
salesman forgot his wallet came back and found the body by 9 00 and now brenner 's car is missing
yeah but always a UNknown act to a more UNknown violent one
these UNknown are like UNknown at night it 's easy to see in hard to see out
they watched from over here
spree killers act on impulse ; they don 't generally stalk their UNknown
you think they UNknown this guy ?
she was here in l a in UNknown 2
awful long time to hold a grudge
bad memories last a long time
this is the second crime they haven 't signed
you know ?
so much so that it 's usually only their mistakes that lead to their UNknown you know not not some sort of a UNknown analysis not not uh
i 'm UNknown
and i guess i 'm just trying to fill the air with noise to keep you from telling me that
i 'm staying
and you know chuckles softly
no i i do believe we we have a far superior program
it 's a great opportunity and um hopefully it 's a great opportunity for us as well
i know i for one would very much like to see what happens
i 'm just not sure how to break it to charlie
well might i suggest directly ?
he doesn 't take change that well you know
when i tried to sell my house he bought it
eh don 't underestimate charles ability to adapt
you know over the last few years he 's made some very striking changes UNknown for the better
i mean after all
by the way since you UNknown e sold your house where have you been living ?
oh just various people 's UNknown the car my office sometimes
you mean you 'r e homeless ?
no no no just without an address
oh yeah so i am
larry i 'm going to give you the same advice that i UNknown e given to all the geniuses i know
which is ?
number came back to a lydia UNknown
possession and intent to sell
look at may 13 UNknown 2
picked up on a drug sweep with crystal UNknown
now there 's a coincidence
fortunately a judge didn 't think so
he gave us a title 3 UNknown
i figured we 'd give it some time before we brought lydia in phone ringing see if crystal tries to contact her
we have a call coming in
you going to help me out ?
do i have a choice ?
so you UNknown l help
i UNknown l ask around
pay phone washington and broadway
you really going to do it ?
watch the news tonight
wonder what they were doing in this area
two in one night ?
maybe they didn 't like the UNknown
blood on the bumper
no robbery no poem
UNknown and winters have now switched
knock at door
hey do you know who you 'r e playing with ?
do you know what you 'r e standing in ?
he 's still in the burn ward
open the door
no trouble lady
it 's here just like she said
no UNknown come on
of course i love you
size nine UNknown
buck picked that up between kansas and missouri
you know UNknown UNknown like to use UNknown as workers
cause they can pay them in product
lydia UNknown you figure she worked here gave them the setup ?
it 's never been about the money before
yeah but drugs are what got crystal arrested and sent back home
maybe this was symbolic or UNknown
or it 's all about grenades
hey i got a whole UNknown of weapons up here guys
do i do i have something on my on the side of my mouth ?
i 'm moving out
i like living with you
it 's just that i 'd like to try living by myself
yeah no okay i can i i can see that
you can ?
of course i 'm going to miss you
well i mean its not like
i 'm moving out of the city or anything
i mean uh we 'r e going to see each other all the time
look at this this is pretty pretty nice you know
you got a swimming pool and a tennis court
you going to play tennis ?
are you sure you 'r e all right with this ?
it 's just that you seem a little bit more all right than i would expect
no go go uh sow your wild oats
yeah you know otto UNknown spent 17 years searching for proof that nervous impulses are UNknown transmitted ?
it came to him one night in a dream
and he wrote it down but the next morning he woke up he couldn 't read his own handwriting
now fortunately he had the same dream the next night
good for otto UNknown
you know that ?
i don 't know why you know
if this is something he wants to do i want him to be happy
you know ?
what if she stayed here for me ?
i don 't know
i mean i 'm happy but uh but
but what ?
you know ?
you know we UNknown e only been on a few dates really
what if she gave up this job for
oh my god what if she wants to move into my house now that my dad is gone ?
you 'r e getting a little ahead of yourself here aren 't you ?
still still what ?
you chased her till she caught you
it 's the story of two people traveling across the country committing crimes
but that 's only half the story
you see it 's like as if we 'r e looking at a plane
oh some pattern
well on a little bit of information and a big hunch
the missing wyoming dot
the missing point on a curve that i didn 't even realize i was looking at
it 's a variation on something called a pursuit curve
it 's created when one point chases after another
charlie can the curve tell us where they 'r e going to turn up next ?
well UNknown said that if he knew the velocity and position of every particle in the universe he could predict every future event
you get the feeling that everybody 's forgotten about us ?
i get that feeling a lot
just uh go
i just meant that uh
look there 's a bag for you
it 's under the mailbox on the corner
you 'r e a good friend
we go for it she 's going to see us
she 's still our best lead
we UNknown e got to let her run
what if the bag that crystal just left for her is full of hand grenades ?
ian there 's no decision here
take it !
how you doing lydia ?
i don 't know what you 'r e talking about
things that people leave under UNknown
no way you can say that 's mine
you got the drugs back
what else do you want ?
we want crystal and the grenades you virtually handed her from the UNknown lab
this girl is supposed to be your friend right ?
you UNknown e known her since UNknown 2
you were UNknown together
her parents were pushing her for grades
they wouldn 't let her hang out
it didn 't sound like a house i would have run away from
and how long was it before you got her into drugs ?
it wasn 't me
you know the kind that comes on like he 's a friend finds her an apartment
and before he says what he really wants it 's too late for her to say no anymore ?
six months later she and billy turned up on my doorstep
looking for a place to crash
billy being the married guy ?
billy being the rebound guy
he was a total loser
i tried to tell UNknown that but this married guy he screwed her up real good
billy 's the reason we got busted though
they were his drugs
so why did she call you 15 years later ?
she said she met someone someone who was going to help make things right
when i told her about the UNknown lab and all the guns she got real interested
what about billy ?
i don 't know ???
jack of all trades master of none
nobody 's heard from him for about two days
if reeves is right about the UNknown lab hit
crystal 's on some UNknown kick
the guy who got her busted would be up on the list
yeah along with pierce brenner
the dead car salesman
crystal and lydia were waiting tables
lydia said that crystal disappeared with a married guy
all right so what ?
she runs away she hooks up with brenner UNknown with billy rivers and drugs
this isn 't about a rebound
this girl has crossed a threshold
she is 15 years old and there are no more boundaries
straightened her life out and became some kind of model citizen
until she killed the kid 's father
billy rivers is one of those mistakes
well we better find her before she gets him
i mean we UNknown e been through his known associates his favorite UNknown right ?
the guy is hiding
what do you think about you know
like UNknown the pursuit curve for that ?
uh for crystal chasing rivers
if we can find him fast he 'd be good bait
you know i UNknown e
i UNknown e been running expressions assuming a dog chasing a cat
it 's actually a dog chasing a cat chasing a mouse
i thought i was an airplane
oh cats and dogs work better now
the cat has two sets
and let the cat come to him
then we don 't have to know his location right ?
just where UNknown is going to be looking for him
UNknown has already searched while using them to UNknown her decision patterns
yeah but if you 'r e in the middle of something
i 'm just trying to reduce don 's search options for those spree killers
as long as we go someplace close
it important but you are important too
look charlie we UNknown l both have to eat again
anyway i have a UNknown on thursday on the UNknown UNknown of UNknown UNknown and i should probably go over my notes
charlie 's math says crystal should show up here next
guys intel has billy rivers cousin in the back bedroom
you know that crystal 's looking for rivers
she 's been on the streets talking to all the same people as us
it 's amazing
i don 't think she wanted advantages
i think she just wanted to see what was out there
a little advice ?
you 'r e probably right
UNknown am is coming up behind them
UNknown am is parked two houses up
she must be in a second car they never split up
yeah but the streets are empty
she 's not in the zone
he 's coming into the backyard
he 's making his way to the back door
UNknown loves me so much she never lets me out of her sight
i had to wait for her to fall asleep just to leave
she shot his father 14 times right ?
he wanted to get her fired for that
and she killed him to protect your secret ?
you 'r e not listening
i killed him
the things she 's already been through in life
you didn 't tell her where you were going did you ?
you wanted to get to rivers before she did ?
UNknown wants to talk to him
this guy who lied to her he used her he got her arrested
look you see what she did to brenner ?
what almost happened to you huh ?
if you love her buck you have to help us take her safely
take her ?
hey how 'd it go ?
any new information ?
i don 't think he 's going to budge
you got any juice left on those pursuit curves ?
i UNknown l take another look but i suspect we 'r e no longer looking at anything like a classic pursuit
you know dad 's planning on moving out right ?
you okay with it ?
of course i 'm okay
i mean no i 'm going to miss him though
i 'm going to miss the guy but i can certainly understand his point of view
yeah watch he UNknown l become this big stud you know ?
oh no season tickets for the UNknown ?
dude i wasn 't ever going to move to boston
well so what 's the problem ?
there 's no problem
no she 's amazing
it just seems like i keep wondering if she 's thinking is this what i gave up harvard for ?
ah she stayed
maybe i don 't want those things though you know ?
i mean don 't know if relationships are ever exactly what we want
i mean me and robin
you like her ?
i don 't know
you got it you know ?
the only thing that UNknown l screw that up
is me ?
you know how fearsome a thought that is that a single choice can determine a destiny ?
buck winters or crystal UNknown 's destiny ?
one 's essentially a child the other 's a fully formed adult
and unlike crystal
i don 't even regret most of them
does that make you uncomfortable ?
listen i live in hotel rooms and sleep on office UNknown
does that make you uncomfortable ?
no i find it oddly attractive
both of you with these layers upon layers of endless UNknown
you know i don 't think i 'm ever going to tire of being compared to the UNknown UNknown
and thank you for breakfast
i was way too wound up to go home
hey you should give me a call when your orbit comes back around
maybe towards my place sometime
not exactly the kind of guy i pictured you with
i really wouldn 't if i were you
you know who i am so you know what i 'm capable of
we live or we die it 's your choice
what do you want to do ?
do you want to live or do you want to die ?
what i want is you to get in the car and drive
captioning sponsored by UNknown paramount network UNknown and brought to you by UNknown
they have extraordinary abilities
i think i 'm old enough for you to tell me who my real parents are
while her father shows a darker side
he tried to force me
the UNknown ?
do you understand me ?
while nathan escapes the face of evil
niki and her son
he 's here !
and peter gets a message from the future
this is what you UNknown e been waiting for
that will define their destiny
the girl you have to save her
save the UNknown save the world !
we are all connected
and now heroes continues
a battle between what exists and what is yet to be born
in the midst of these birth pains morality loses its meaning
the question of good and evil reduced to one simple choice survive or perish
we have to save her
some japanese guy keeps calling leaving messages
my name is peter UNknown
i have a message for you
what did he say ?
he has a message for you
what message ?
save the UNknown save the world
yeah but you painted these
so did you
we don 't know where she is
we just know that we need to save her
tell him about the guy from the future
he is the guy from the future
a UNknown nakamura from the future who speaks english and carries a sword stopped time to tell me that i have to save the UNknown
that 's that 's all i know
you came from the future and told them to save the UNknown
and you had a sword
i had a sword ?
get to new york
i had a sword
some sign of where they are
see these paintings they fit together like pages in a comic book
there 's a panel missing
what was right there ?
but there 's a piece about that size
i painted it weeks ago
simone has it
it 's with them
i don 't remember
tell her a guy from the future said you needed it
i 'm sure she UNknown l love that
UNknown wants to breed mr
UNknown with her poodle
they call it a UNknown or a UNknown
mr UNknown doesn 't want anything to do with a breed that has UNknown in its name
no i don 't says mr UNknown
honey i think we left those UNknown in too long
smells like something 's burning
they look okay
not after what happened at the dog park
i thought that big dog was gonna chew your hand off
which would UNknown e put an end to your UNknown career
it looked worse than it was
and my UNknown career is UNknown kicking off the field as we speak
at least i 'm playing my part in the bake sale
not right now claire bear
you UNknown e been on the phone for an hour
who you been talking to ?
yeah about that
meet your biological parents ?
turns out they want to meet you too tomorrow
wait just a minute
who do they think they are ?
i didn 't say yes
nobody 's dropping anything
this doesn 't have to happen now
you don 't have to do this
not unless you 'r e absolutely ready
i 'm ready
the police are right outside
if i scream they will be in here in two seconds
then i hope you don 't scream
you 'r e not wearing your wedding ring
i think that you better leave
you being here
micah doesn 't need this
micah needs his father
this is still my home
i 'm not going anywhere
you can either believe me or not
i 'm going to check on our boy
open the door ma 'a m
i UNknown l let you get the door
ma 'a m please open the door
ma 'a m we thought we heard something inside the house
is everything all right ?
i was uh
well if you need anything we UNknown l be out here till tomorrow morning okay ?
is something wrong ?
i 'm fine
then we UNknown l let you get back to bed okay ?
just remember we 'r e here if you need us
i planned the job
baby it 's gonna solve all out problems
it was 2 million
the money that you stole from UNknown
and if we ran with UNknown 's money he wouldn 't just kill me
he 'd kill you micah
so i stepped out
someone who knew the plan
someone who killed my crew
oh and they just made off with all the money ?
you have no idea who that is
i know it was a woman
a woman ?
heard he just cleaned somebody 2 million so i 'm gonna pay him a visit tomorrow and see if i can 't squeeze a name out of him
why don 't you just ask them what happens when they cut themselves ?
or you could just cut them and find out
probably just think i was all bitter because they gave me away
you 'r e a little UNknown sometimes but i don 't think you 'r e all that bitter
about the adoption thing i mean
i 'm not
and it 's a little weird and maybe a little sad but i 'm not mad
i mean i love my parents
what if your biological parents raised you though ?
it 'd be an entirely different scenario
what if they can do what i can do ?
what if they 'r e like me ?
well i hope they 'r e not
no offense but i like
i like that you 'r e the freak
it makes you more special or whatever
are you flirting with me ?
i mean the ones who raised you ?
he 'd never be able to wrap his mind around something like that
it would break him
what happens if we get to new york and it explodes ?
if we get to new york it won 't explode
that 's the idea it 's the heroic journey
it 's your heroic journey
it 's our heroic journey
you don 't have to have UNknown to be a hero
so why didn 't future you come to see us ?
why did he go to some peter guy in new york that we UNknown e never met ?
future me was afraid of causing a UNknown in the space time UNknown
you 'r e talking out of your ass
you don 't know how any of this works
i know exactly how this stop !
it 's the high roller you cheated !
i cheated ?
i told you
now it 's time for a little UNknown
hi i 'm lisa
so how are we gonna do this ?
we don 't
what do you think d l ?
you think you can just strut back in here like nothing 's ever happened ?
do you have any idea what i UNknown e been through the last six months ?
but you did
that wasn 't enough for you ?
no UNknown it wasn 't enough for me because that business doesn 't fly when you have a family
when you left i became another person
i don 't care that you took off your clothes on the internet
i 'm not mad about it
look you did what you had to do
look you can stay here tonight
but you need to leave in the morning
if that 's what you want
come to bed
we need to leave our mission awaits
we still owe him more we can 't leave yet
give them good cards but not too good
hey japanese guy you in or not ?
i 'm in
some ancient oriental voodoo ?
i 'm starting to think i 'm getting UNknown
no one 's getting UNknown
i will bet 1 000
i don 't need to pee
they 'r e going to kill us !
a gun ?
what should we do ?
what 's that ?
i need to stop it
i couldn 't save them
i just hid in here
a hero doesn 't hide
he does if he wants to live
we need to get out of here
before whoever did this comes back
your hair is getting so long
it 's a mess
god we were kids
you didn 't get much last night
i slept as much as you did
trying to be all quiet
i did ?
we were on the train together then suddenly he started carrying on about a mysterious traveler who stopped time and told him to save a UNknown
it was all very fascinating
i should write a paper on the experience
maybe you provoked him with sarcasm
peter UNknown went from steady as a clam to as you say crap house rat in a blink
no provocation whatsoever
you 'd like that wouldn 't you ?
yeah well so would you
did i tell you that the man who paints the future is a heroin addict ?
did you see any of the paintings ?
i didn 't see him
after what i witnessed on the train i doubt he even exists
now what ?
just get on a plane and that 's it
yes that 's exactly it
and what about UNknown ?
we were no good for each other anyway
thank you eden
for both me and my father
you 'r e welcome
that 's why i 'm not even gonna say good bye
good bye eden
you 'r e still reading these huh ?
remember all those comics my granddad used to have
tales from the crypt
scared you silly
i 'm sorry for not being around
how 's your mom ?
how 's she doing ?
cause you 'r e the man of the house when i 'm not around
between you and me
ain 't no jail can hold your old man
why not ?
like superman ?
want to see ?
it 's gonna crush him when you run again
there won 't be any more running
not after today
it will when i get that woman 's name
i guess i could UNknown down in your UNknown and you could give me a lift
every cop in vegas is looking for me
so you want me to take that risk
i want you to hear that i was set up from the horse 's mouth
i know you UNknown
but once i 'm out of your sight you 'r e gonna start to wonder
and i don 't ever want you to wonder about me again
she has your mouth and your nose doesn 't she ?
yeah it looks like it doesn 't it
i wonder what else of yours i have
can i get anybody anything to drink ?
lemonade just made a pitcher from scratch
we have sodas iced tea
we have UNknown don 't we claire ?
just made UNknown m last night
the two of us
i would love some lemonade thank you
so what can we tell you about ourselves ?
i don 't see a welcome mat
it 's all right
wasn 't that locked ?
go back to the car now
come on let 's get out of here
as high school sweethearts we didn 't even make it to graduation
once lisa got pregnant it was over
he wanted to keep the baby
no i don 't think that
this is so awkward i UNknown e got lip sweat
should you be eavesdropping ?
so is there anything i should know ?
well there is something
hold on a second
then stop him
he 's already gone
what about peter UNknown ?
he claims he can fly but i don 't have confirmation
also there may have been an encounter with somebody who can stop time
he told him to save the UNknown
are you still there ?
bring him in
how much ?
micah 's tuition
i 'm sorry
it got physical
and it looked like what we saw today
what they were torn apart ?
i didn 't see anything
it was me
what if i did ?
w what if i got up in the middle of the night and i went
baby you are being played
whoever set me up set you up and they 'r e making damn sure i can 't clear my name
i don 't
did you leave it at tina 's ?
no i had it when i came home
okay honey will you just give me another minute ?
we need to tell the police
they UNknown l never believe us
the only way i can clear my name is to find the person that did this myself
okay it 's been a minute
i UNknown l come help you
get what ?
i did ?
you told me to pack some clothes and that we were going to grandma 's house
mom are you okay ?
i 'm not feeling well
god what 's happening to me ?
you 'r e not real
oh i am as real as you are
oh we 'r e a lot of things niki but we 'r e not crazy
micah where 's mom ?
she 's in her bedroom
she didn 't feel good
what do you think d l is gonna do when he finds out what we UNknown e done ?
what we UNknown e done ?
are you and mom gonna get back together ?
most of the time in relationships when somebody makes a mistake the other person just pretends it didn 't happen
but when someone thinks you made a mistake and you didn 't it
it just gets a lot more complicated
we framed him
killed those little bitches at the poker game
we UNknown e been very busy
those men were ripped apart
but they didn 't do anything to me
leaving witnesses would be sloppy
i did what had to be done
like i always do
i don 't know
you 'r e gonna get the money and you 'r e going to take micah as far away from d l as you can
i UNknown l do the rest
d l can take care of me
i don 't need you
and then he UNknown l take micah away from us
he UNknown l put it all together and when he does it 's really only a question of whether he kills you before he leaves
dad you know how you have a secret ?
so you have a choice
you can let d l take our son away from us forever or you can do exactly what i say
where 's the money ?
you 'd have been killed
i UNknown e been given a gift UNknown
i 'm supposed to use it to help people
to save people
maybe i 'm not the hero i thought i was
every hero is on a journey to find his place in the world
but it 's a journey
you don 't start at the end
otherwise they can 't make a movie about it later
what if i 'm on the wrong path ?
what if i was supposed to save those people ?
you can bend time and space
maybe when you can do it better you can come back here and fix things
like a do over ?
i mean not your biological father but you know your dad
he 's walking out the UNknown parents
is that what you 'r e calling them the UNknown parents ?
oh that 's so cold and impersonal
i know your visit meant a lot to claire
when i was her age i had enough weighing on my head
i 'm glad i could help
i UNknown l keep you posted
was it what you were hoping for ?
i guess i just wanted them to tell me who i am
they don 't know any better than i do
baby nobody can tell you who you are
that 's just something you gotta figure out for yourself
can we throw these away ?
are they burnt ?
you know i have to hand it to your dad
this isn 't the first time we UNknown e tried to find those UNknown parents
it 's not ?
i was scared to death and they were nowhere to be found
what kind of disease ?
how did you know there was something wrong with me ?
nothing was wrong with you
you were fine
of what things ?
you had a cough claire
don 't turn UNknown on me
your brother 's bad enough
you 'r e a very brave man dad
set me up
i loved you niki
i can 't control it
i don 't know what 's happening to me
i 'm taking micah
good bye niki
mom is everything okay ?
everything 's fine
go to your room
may i come in ?
evolution is an imperfect and often violent process
morality loses its meaning
thanks to UNknown for the transcript
UNknown by UNknown for www UNknown com
there 's more to reality than meets a normal eye
behind the curtain of everyday consciousness is hidden another UNknown strange mental universe
it 's the realm of UNknown experience
and those who UNknown e been there describe the visit as the most significant event of their UNknown
until recent times that was a world known only to holy men to saints or perhaps to the insane
then a generation ago this drug lsd escaped from the laboratory
it was consumed by millions of young people
to some it 's a doorway to the UNknown universe chemical ecstasy enlightenment in a bottle
to others it 's a dangerous and subversive poison
albert UNknown was then a young chemist working in a laboratories of UNknown a large UNknown company
the program i was involved was to study the active principals of medicinal plants
and one of these medical plants we were studying was UNknown
UNknown is a fungus that grows on corn
for centuries UNknown have used it to UNknown the UNknown
at UNknown UNknown was experimenting with UNknown trying to UNknown its effect
on the 16th of april 1943 he was in his laboratory preparing a fresh batch of a compound he first UNknown 5 years before
it was UNknown acid UNknown lsd
the feeling of UNknown to be one with nature
the feeling to see now the true aspect of nature the UNknown and which filled me with happiness
he believed that his present dream like state was in some way connected with the UNknown of lsd that albert UNknown was UNknown that afternoon
he 'd certainly not eaten any but his fingers might possibly have brushed against a few traces of the compound
if so then lsd was a remarkably potent drug
he decided to experiment on himself
being cautious man and i thought i would start with the smallest smallest quantity which even it could have any effect
namely i started with 0 25 UNknown and at intention then to increase UNknown get then to see that something would happen
but this very small dose the first dose of my experiments i UNknown e planned was very very strong
feeling increasingly unwell UNknown was obliged to return home
it was war time he went by bicycle
as a journey progressed the external world began to look stranger and stranger
by the time he reached home normal reality had UNknown
when i entered this room i was really astonished how this room had changed
the room itself and the objects in this room had quite a different form different color different meaning
and the objects like this chair had was like if he was a living object it can moving from inside
that was so unusual that i really got afraid of that i had became insane
a kind next door neighbour brought milk with an UNknown das ich UNknown UNknown UNknown
she too was UNknown transformed
the bizarre and terrifying hallucinations continued all evening
at times UNknown felt that he was dead and had arrived in hell
but at last 6 hours after taking the drug he felt himself returning to the normal world
two days later now fully recovered UNknown reported his discovery to the head of laboratory
no one really knew what medical use lsd might have but this extraordinary substance deserved further study
research soon showed that lsd closely resembles powerful natural chemicals in the brain used to exchange messages between nerve cells
the drug acts like a false signal UNknown the normal flow of information
one specific effect is to UNknown the region of the brain that UNknown information arriving from the senses
a flood of signals reaches consciousness and is experienced as an overwhelming ??? of sensation
the impact on a mind is profound
it is if reality was suddenly UNknown revealing a world UNknown or UNknown transformed
all the senses are affected
colors particularly are brighter and more vivid
sound too is strangely transformed
sights are smelled and sounds are seen
motion becomes a weld of frozen moments
and often the world is UNknown ??? with bizarre UNknown of reality
but hallucinations and pretty colors are only part of the story
lsd also affects the subconscious mind
in the early UNknown psychiatrists began to investigate this aspect of the drug
all over the world scientific papers appeared reporting the use of lsd in a treatment of psychiatric UNknown
the leading center was UNknown hospital in england
here in a purpose built facility known as the lsd block hundreds of mentally ill people were treated with lsd
a consultant psychiatrist to pioneer this work was ronald UNknown
for decade he ran the UNknown unit
today the lsd block has been converted into offices
we meet with dr john UNknown a colleague from the lsd days this remember was a trolley area where the nursing staff used to set up the lsd UNknown
they 'd draw the lsd up with a syringe and you know had these little bits they poured it into UNknown bottles um uh added to it
they just used to stand where you are and most people measures to the first effects came all after about 20 minutes and some were in the fist hour
they would retire to their particular room which have been UNknown to them
i wasn 't quite sure you know it wasn 't funny i wasn 't laughing at anything but i just had those those those things
so that sort of sets a scene for UNknown greater emotional intensity
but with our patients there was very often a great deal of fear a great deal of crying sobbing
and then of course one would want to move in and try and get the patient to relate that to what they were actually UNknown in themselves
given a reputation lsd has today it s natural to wonder whether any patients were harmed by the drug we don t believe that anybody has a long term psychosis
although certain cases have been reported over parts of the world
but we examine our consequences pretty carefully in that respect
and i don t believe anybody was permanently damaged
extraordinary as it now seems thousands of people were given lsd in psychiatric hospitals during the 50 s
according to several independent studies there were surprisingly few bad side effects
and a second group began to experiment with UNknown drugs around this time
they were artists and intellectuals
and the inspiration came from the british writer aldous huxley
huxley was fascinated by UNknown experience and believed that a drug called UNknown might be a means to achieve it
UNknown is found in a cactus called UNknown used by the ritual indians in mexico
they regard UNknown as a sacrament
they consume it in religious ceremonies UNknown
UNknown the effects of UNknown are identical to those of lsd
the drug UNknown a charge an overwhelming journey of the soul
consider one way i told i apologize
just concerned that he bought a grey autograph
and so i had no way out really
and so as i UNknown on last on second last day of my visit
thus it came about one bright may morning
i swallowed four tenths of a UNknown of UNknown dissolved in half a glass of water and sat down to wait for the results
after a while i became aware of a slow dance of golden lights
i was looking UNknown at a small vase of flowers
my eyes traveled from the rose to the carnation to the smooth UNknown of UNknown UNknown which was the iris
i was seeing what adam had seen on the morning of his creation the miracle moment by moment of naked existence
i looked down by chance and went on passionately staring by choice at my own crossed legs
those UNknown in the trousers what a labyrinth of endlessly significant UNknown !
this is how one ought to see how things really are
now someone produced a phonograph and put a recording on the UNknown
these voices they 'r e a kind of bridge back to the human world
through the uneven phrases of the UNknown the music pursued its course never sticking to the same key for two bars together
and suddenly i had an inkling of what it must be like to be mad
i found myself on the brink of panic UNknown under pressure of a reality greater than a mind accustomed to the cosy world of symbols could possibly bear
none too soon i began to return to that reassuring but profoundly UNknown state known as being in one 's right mind
the man who comes back through the door in the wall will never be quite the same as the man who went out
the world he saw that may morning in 1953 profoundly impressed huxley
a name was required for a substance that could provoke such UNknown experience
aldous suggested UNknown
and he then wrote such a rhyme
to make this UNknown world sublime take half a UNknown of UNknown
and i thought this is wonderful word but rather too difficult for most people ???
but i fixed on UNknown
and wrote back
well i think the people who would benefit most of all are professors
not everyone shared huxley s enthusiasm
a british writer arthur UNknown responded in an essay with a UNknown
he UNknown UNknown of UNknown drugs with those who drive to the top of a mountain instead of climbing it step by step
the view he concluded may be identical but the vision of the climber is different from that of the UNknown
such UNknown however only encouraged interest in huxley s account of his UNknown experiments
and others began to follow in his footsteps
well then here i 'm in my home and before i take the drug doctor UNknown scott want to ask 68 dollar questions
bbc told the experiment this is the first time to confirm i want you to repeat this sentence after me
now listen carefully to be rich and prosperous a nation must have a safe secure supply of wood
after initial psychological tests the experiment began at noon shall we go right ahead then ? oh i UNknown l take it yes she is
well i m feeling perfectly fit at the moment the sane is i UNknown e ram and i il take the drug now
an hour and a half later there were definite effects
could you perhaps tell us any particular color which you think ? yes
as is this color just behind camera
i m intoxicated and seeing pink elephants which is of course ???
the thing that pass next to about it
well like i say this is still the 64 dollar question i m looking very hard now the only camera
today elevated to the house of lords christopher mayhew watches the film with UNknown UNknown
and i see that the sentence i meant to say can 't be said
i think this is most interesting that i ve ever done
and i say that after 30 years UNknown a whole ghastly business you know is being UNknown when drugs are being abused when this is our major social problem
i mean i do know all that and i hope and pray it never helped anybody to experiment with drugs
nevertheless the actual experience seems to me to being profoundly interesting and thought provoking
the time is now just on fourteen hundred
and in the last half hour or so christopher has been preoccupied to a very great extend with time
we had numerous discussions on this
in the interval he tried to instruct me as to how to work his recording machine
and unfortunately we were quite unable to work it
he has also been listening to a certain amount of music
now i m going to ask you once more to go with the ad UNknown sentence as i did and also to take away seven from a hundred
now christopher would you be prepared to do that for me please ? well you ve got me
as what i would call my period of time when i m capable to do it all right
now would you like to take away seven from a hundred again ? a 93 86 79 72 66 sixty 72 whatever it is 65 hm 58 51 hm forty
i would be withdrawn from my surroundings and from myself
and having experience state of UNknown for a period of time that didn t end for me didn t last for minutes or hours but for months
i do to show you that my point of view between the time as i perhaps begin this sentence and time that i end it
i actually gone there 's a long time something and
i accept that too
all things have no succession
and that there be no absolute time no absolute space
it is simply what we impose on the outside world
the bbc was worried
mayhew himself was all in favor
but UNknown the footage it was hard to judge the true significance of this experience
expert advise was called for it and a special committee of psychiatrists philosophers and UNknown have assembled
amid those shown the film was cannon UNknown from cambridge university
from a religious standpoint he felt mayhew 's UNknown adventure had been obtained on the cheap
the others agreed
when asked by the bbc whether or not mayhew 's experience was valid
the film was never shown
i think that the experience was valid
and that is my view
and that is and for various sort of associated symptoms
i would say that on that occasion by shortcut
i did visit the world known to UNknown and some mentally sick people
and therefore to that extend i d say it is valid
huxley too was attacked by UNknown
the roman catholic scholar UNknown UNknown wrote an article UNknown the doors of perception
he argued that wide differences in people s response to the drug cast doubt to an individual claims to enlightenment
so that he could write with authority UNknown arranged to take a dose of UNknown himself
overcome by hysterical laughter he found the experience to be spiritually empty
and he concluded that huxley s claims had no more UNknown than the delusions of a lunatic
UNknown maintained that the visions of the great christian UNknown were something entirely different
those who believe in a value of UNknown drugs see no clear distinction
i believe that the experiences one be one has under lsd are very similar even identical with UNknown experiences
it has been discussion along with scientists
but if you compare the reports of UNknown of the saints the text reports with reports on people who had UNknown experience on the lsd you cannot find any difference
can the UNknown experience of saints really be UNknown by chemical means ?
30 years after UNknown UNknown raised the question his UNknown of the university of oxford are still UNknown it
spiritual self UNknown was hardly the ambition of another group interested in lsd and UNknown during the UNknown
the american government were attracted to UNknown drugs for less UNknown purposes
through the freedom of information act
marks has obtained copies of classified cla documents that reveal why the agency was interested in lsd
the essence of the UNknown say business is control this was an instrument or potential instrument for UNknown people 's control for making them commit acts against their will
in UNknown the cla produced an internal report so sensitive only one copy was made
it concerned UNknown the project that involved the testing of lsd on UNknown american citizens throughout the UNknown
people who did not know what happened they believed that they became insane and the all kind of accidents happened following these kind of UNknown
that was really crime to keep people without a knowledge with agents is a crime
the american military was also experimenting with lsd as a potential weapon
here is a group of normal soldiers responding correctly to a series of routine real commands
after receiving a small dose of lsd they are confused and UNknown
the idea was to spray the drug on enemy troops
but those however proved rather difficult to control
and there was a different kind of UNknown from these experiments
one that took the army and the cla entirely by surprise
civilians who were exposed to lsd began to do strange things
i believe with the UNknown of acid we UNknown e discovered a new way to think
and it had to do with UNknown together new thoughts in your mind that produced people like bob UNknown and john UNknown and william s burroughs
in UNknown cla UNknown researches of the UNknown park hospital in california were paying students 40 a day to take lsd
one volunteer was ken UNknown
UNknown ??? author of one flew over the cuckoo 's nest
and today a farmer in oregon
you were in a little room pretty much by yourself
odd by the power of the drug UNknown began to distribute it to his friends
UNknown america lsd was leaking out of the laboratory
i UNknown e always thought that this is one of those things that proves that god has a sense of humor
you can hear the celestial laughter when you realize it was the cla that UNknown turned on america
i knew from the use of this kinds of UNknown in old UNknown the indians there 's a taboo on these UNknown
they are only used in religious setting and in the hands of the UNknown not in the public
and the UNknown in our society is a psychiatrist and they should remain in the hands of the UNknown
and therefore i was really became immediately
i become UNknown and i UNknown e just said that things would could happen and did happened indeed by the unwise and UNknown use of this substance
next week in the second of these two programs every man follows the bizarre and sometimes tragic events that lsd exploded down to unsuspecting world
lsd is one of the strangest and most UNknown UNknown known to science
a dose smaller than a grain of salt UNknown a hazardous mental journey into a universe of hallucination intense emotion and some believe UNknown revelation
these remarkable effects were discovered by the swiss chemist albert hoffman in 1943
during the 50 s the lsd was used widely for research in psychiatric hospitals
than in the early UNknown s lsd leaked out of the laboratory
with bizarre and unforeseen consequences the drug was consumed by a generation of young people seeking spiritual UNknown and an escape from the conventional world
introducing the american way of life on the threshold of the golden 60 s color style comfort UNknown and convenience
recreation fun these are the ultimate desires of today tomorrow and the years ahead of these
post war economic growth and material prosperity in the west did not satisfy the desires of everybody
many young people lacking secure belief but living secure lives felt a spiritual dimension was lacking
for them this bus came to UNknown UNknown liberation
lsd was a ticket to ride
i believe with the UNknown of acid we discovered a new way to think
and it had to do with UNknown together new thoughts in your mind that produced people like bob dylan and john UNknown and william s barrows
with money from his first novel one flew over the UNknown nest
UNknown and his friends bought a second hand school bus painted it bright colors and loaded with lsd set off across america
on a journey across the continent UNknown and his band of merry UNknown sensed a nation on the edge of a revolution
to UNknown the strange UNknown effects of lsd seemed perfectly in tune with a times
i think that something happened in the early 60 s that lsd was related to music was related to
there was new movement in cinema and in stage
and maybe that once a century something goes off like a century flower
lsd was just perhaps the UNknown that fell off of it but it didn t make it happen it was part of it
at a time when many of his fellow students were UNknown the UNknown UNknown
roger UNknown today professor of philosophy in a college UNknown it all with deep suspicion
very difficult to UNknown the 60 s world you will
i think one could say very briefly ??? that it was the attempt to have rights without duties claims without responsibilities and pleasure without cost
and the real cost of having any peaceful enjoyment of the world is that one UNknown institutions from makes a sacrifice in order to preserve one s inheritance
this was something that i think the people of the 60 s the young people of the 60 s were very reluctant to do
they were lead by timothy UNknown the former harvard psychology professor fired for giving lsd to his students
our aim like the aims of any religious group just beginning is to transform american society
i m sure many of you viewers know
america today is an insane asylum
the american people are completely hung up on material UNknown on power on war making its an insane asylum over here
and it s our goal to lift the spiritual level of the american people
we gonna try to bring about a religious renaissance and a spiritual revolution
UNknown s east coast UNknown community had a UNknown attitude to lsd that UNknown sharply with the merry UNknown UNknown west coast style
one day the two groups met
we came through UNknown and noisy they are a more UNknown group but there was no friction between us in fact
i think they even gave us piece of baba UNknown famous suit did you ever heard of that story ?
in UNknown UNknown wrote to the firm placing an order for a hundred grams of the drug
enough doses for 2 million people
the letter was addressed to albert hoffman who d stumble upon the strange effect of lsd in 1943
already alarmed by non medical abuse of his discovery
hoffman advised UNknown against UNknown UNknown
i became aware that lsd put became a problem from france and to us
and they wrote me that it had been used on the street and that had already made lot of propaganda for use outside of the medical profession
and i immediately realized that it could be dangerous because the substance which has such deep effect must be used carefully
you 'r e introduced to lsd
unless you UNknown e taken some other drug
the drug was freely available and everyone joined in its UNknown consumption
lsd was not illegal
the kids who take lsd aren t gonna fight your wars middle class middle age whiskey drinking generals
they not going to join your UNknown middle class middle age whiskey drinking corporation presidents
enormous crowds come out to hear me lecture
whenever i go to a college i always sold out
it s not because i m that clever it because they gave me the good lines in the show turn on tune in drop out
such an UNknown UNknown attitude was not always characteristic of those interested in the spiritual potential of lsd
in the early 60 s a group of UNknown and UNknown in boston conducted a remarkable and serious minded investigation into the religious UNknown of UNknown drugs
the experiment took place in the marsh chapel of boston university on good friday UNknown
today two of the UNknown return there for the first time
i must have been sitting down here
it was a kind of throne
UNknown UNknown was one of twenty students studying for holy orders who volunteered
well we gathered that morning all probably an hour before actual service began upstairs
and we were in groups of four there were five groups of four twenty people who were subjects
and we were all handed an envelope that we were asked to open and to consume the capsule that was inside
of course none of us knew who had the drug and who had the UNknown
and i don t know how many minutes UNknown before we all began
i believe feeling a reaction the UNknown in fact was a form of UNknown that would create a sensation
i think at that point i was very much aware that something very unusual is beginning to happen to me
a sound recording was made of the service which by good fortune still exists today
he came to me with his eyes and asked for water
but his eyes were UNknown and deep as well shafts
they UNknown my brain with their profound grazing
robert UNknown also received the UNknown drug
for him the experience was UNknown unpleasant
i tried hard to concentrate and remember were i was
because ??? that
and then as i concentrated it occurred to me that this was supposed to be an experiment
i remembered that it was to be an experiment and in mind expansion
then i kind of went back and thought ok lets see what UNknown
and he said
and i felt that i had to get out of there and go find somebody and tell him there is a man on a cross
but there were people in appeal and i felt i couldn t get out and that s when
i felt a failure as though i wasn t doing what i had to do
to determine if the volunteers experiences were spiritually valid walter UNknown submitted their written accounts to a panel of UNknown
the experts score the report for authenticity and after careful UNknown analysis UNknown concluded that the drug had induced UNknown states UNknown from traditional religious visions
many of the UNknown themselves agreed but could they be certain their experiences were genuine ?
i don t know if i can be sure other than to know that it something that happened to me
and i realize that s a very UNknown appraisal of that but
i don t know what else i can go with
i know that was deeply meaningful and moving to my life
impressive the UNknown drugs may seem to individual there are nonetheless many reasons for questioning the experience
whatever the actual intensity of the experience to call it religious is not has nothing to do with how intense it is is to interpret it ??? a meaning
and when you administer to yourself a drug which you know is affecting you by giving producing a chemical transformation in the brain
and you are deliver the engineering that
it 's UNknown difficult sincerely to interpret this is a UNknown of the divine spirit or is a revelation of a UNknown world
it simply is an act of self deception to put that kind of religious interpretation on out of thought
but as the 60 s progressed mind expansion became a UNknown
in switzerland the directors of UNknown began to hear of the wide spread and UNknown abuse of their product
UNknown UNknown was responsible for the production and distribution of lsd
like kind of an explosion
lsd suddenly was on the street and was manufactured by a lot of people
because immediately when it had high market value
well that was a value that 1 UNknown of lsd suddenly had a value of few hundred thousand of of dollars
and this element which changed dramatically the whole situation was for the firm the moment to say now we have to stop it
UNknown withdrew the lsd from sale but it was already too late
black market UNknown of the drug were everywhere including britain
if you haven t heard of lsd you will
among them rosy UNknown co founder of the UNknown magazine spare rib
incredible looking back to think how people just took it like candy
and in fact we were told it was candy it had names that were like candy
you know sunshine and yellow orange and everything that sounded like children 's sweets
and you tended to do it a bit i mean it became
lots of people who would say do it every saturday night it became part of their life
everything is colored everything you know is
ah it must be to do an orange not only orange oh
i haven t seen color
i live in a UNknown world i can t use color i can do everything
the romantic view of UNknown drugs as the road to personal and social liberation was not shared by all
politically inclined members of the counter culture soon discovered UNknown
and it was a real UNknown in the drug culture which was logically made up by the fact that it was totally easy to get buy with very little money
that you could be sort of hovering on the edge of a quite a twilight world in that you went up against any such a breach of UNknown
any money definitely no never paying taxes or bothering by any things like that which were the real world
that was the real UNknown world which you wanted to overthrow
and yet of course you were living on it
and that was the ultimate irony that it was that world
and that huge UNknown boom that we were all UNknown in america and in england
that we 'r e supporting that dream say lived in a place where you thought i m really changing the world but in fact you were escaping it
lsd is a far worse even than err heroine i think because of its action on certain people again
and now we UNknown e had experience where people who have taken lsd have gone in through plate glass windows
we have people who were inside with lsd coming out through plate glass windows
so i don 't know what direction these people are moving in
by UNknown a strong public reaction against lsd had set in
the UNknown and the government were busy pointing out the dangers
any stress in this rising face will trip this man into a bad trip
he will have the same effect as the man who was given a material and doesn 't know he 's getting it
he will be terrified
he is intensely extremely terribly uncomfortable
if he is alone if it 's possible for him there 's only one escape from this discomfort a suicide this man will kill himself
UNknown was commonplace as public UNknown about the dangers and value of lsd UNknown
scores of books and hundreds of scientific articles appeared
and for a while UNknown drugs became a cause UNknown
at the center of the storm was a distinguished psychiatrist sidney cohen
one of the us government 's chief UNknown on UNknown drugs
well lsd can do many UNknown things the they are done almost never under control in UNknown conditions they happen when people take it casually and UNknown
and when this happens this is news
and news is what has given lsd its current reputation
particular concern was caused by a widely UNknown but subsequently UNknown report that lsd might damage UNknown
lurid UNknown were drawn with ? UNknown other dangers however were real enough 20 years on we may be able to UNknown the true risks of lsd
a UNknown of the government UNknown standing UNknown on drug abuse is david UNknown
there 's no no doubt that there are UNknown about lsd
but there are very real risks which are increased when you got a UNknown manufacture
the risks are around people having bad trips that 's they experience very unpleasant and very intense feelings
that they have accidents because they believe they can do things which they really can 't do
the happening cases people trying to fly out of windows
many found its mental effects overwhelming
attracted by descriptions of visual UNknown and UNknown revelation he took a large dose of lsd with a friend UNknown the experience was as advertised
a normally UNknown event assumed terrifying proportions under the influence of the drug
and i went back to where our camp was and we tried to cook some bacon on our completely used up UNknown
and there to my horror were ten or twelve UNknown of dead pig
i UNknown e never seen it like this before but there it was sliced up dead ??? pig
and i was horrified and shocked and and we got in a car and we tried back to london
and all the way back i was hunted by green monsters UNknown monsters cartoon kind of monsters not real monsters
who were in my head but out of control and laughing at me pointing their faces at me and going UNknown UNknown UNknown UNknown we UNknown e got you
it put me off forever
i had this negative horrible feeling that behind everything there was something horrible
i didn 't want that experience ever again
as the UNknown were on more and more reports of people damaged by lsd reached albert UNknown in switzerland
the substance that he once hoped might unlock the secrets of the mind had become a monster
and i said no it 's really not and this must UNknown in the ray right way use the proper the lsd not dangerous compound
it is very very dangerous if used UNknown and without respecting its very very deep influence on the UNknown even on consciousness
but lsd was being used UNknown by very many people
UNknown became inevitable
in UNknown president johnson took stern measures
the time has come to stop the sale of slavery to the young !
laws were passed in america and around the world UNknown lsd and UNknown it to have no medical value
there 's UNknown people a year killed here in alcohol related deaths
you don 't see any big thing about alcohol being evil
there 's how many people smoking and dying of it
how many of all of these and yet nobody 's been killed
why is it that people think it 's so evil what is it about it that is scares people so deeply
even the goddamn what is it ?
because they are afraid that there is more to reality than they have confronted
did the establishment UNknown lsd because it revealed to the young a truth better concealed
lord william deeds former m p an editor of the daily telegraph sat on the committee that advised the british government to ban lsd
he denies UNknown UNknown was involved
we are talking on the UNknown when all this things were ? sought and thought and shared
and exact the same arguments were ??? on the UNknown ??? of UNknown in the UNknown the UNknown it was part of an attack on youth culture
it was never attack on young people it was never a political measure it was ??? on medical advice
as well as the medical dangers the committee in their report considered and then dismissed the possible spiritual benefits of lsd
i find it very hard to accept that lsd offers what we could seriously call a religious or spiritual experience
it can offer a UNknown experience it can take you outside the sphere which you normally can think in or you live in
but to relate that directly to religious belief to religious revelation if you like should be taken with a pinch of salt
few deny the reality of the UNknown vision but many doubt its worth
is there anything of value to be found in a UNknown irrational realm of lsd UNknown ?
the common way we think about the nature of human mind is that it is either sane or insane
lsd hints to us that there is a an area of the mind which could be called UNknown beyond sanity and yet not insane
not only of art but of science
and it may be that we are we could approach it by a thoughtful wise study of lsd
today the suggestion that there may be a good side to lsd could hardly be less fashionable
the drug has an appalling public reputation
UNknown by this image of a naked girl deranged by lsd which opened the recent tv UNknown of the operation UNknown police UNknown
the romantic appeal drugs had in UNknown age has gone
it 's been replaced by sorted association with criminal exploitation and wasted UNknown
some blame lsd for UNknown drug taking UNknown the way for today 's more deadly UNknown
heroine i don 't know what all this fuss is about
i can handle it ok so i do heroine a bit now
i can control it
this not how i become an addict i just do heroine slight problem look
i UNknown e this thing under control just gonna touch a UNknown time ???
everyone thinks i can control heroine until it starts to control them
i can give up tomorrow good night
we could make a distinction between heroine which is drug which creates physical UNknown and lsd which is drug which has no physical UNknown
in the UNknown people are using drugs like lsd as means of escaping reality of avoiding the unpleasantness of life
of UNknown in a sense it doesn 't really matter what reasons people have for using it
what does matter is that lsd is an UNknown powerful drug
whose effect we can 't really control and we can 't control when we take it
on the day he died from cancer in UNknown
huxley asked his second wife lora to UNknown him with lsd
that was the same day that the president kennedy was assassinated
then i thought
lsd was already beginning its descent to UNknown
and the UNknown of albert UNknown 's discovery were claiming for it the status of a religious sacrament
i think that many of the intellectuals of the UNknown were really failed priests
i experienced another reality under lsd and before i had always thought there is only one reality a true reality and but then i
i realized there are the UNknown of reality

william blake do you know how to use this weapon ?
you will learn to speak through it and your poetry will now be written with blood
what is your name ?
my name is nobody
he who talks
i prefer to be called nobody
my blood is mixed
my father is UNknown UNknown
this mixture was not respected
as a small boy
so i spent many months stalking the elk people to prove i would soon become a good hunter
one day finally my elk relatives took pity on me and a young elk gave his life to me
with only my knife i took his life
as i was preparing to cut the meat white men came upon me
they were english soldiers
all went black
i was taken to toronto then philadelphia and then to new york
and each time i arrived in another city somehow the white men had moved all their people there ahead of me
each new city contained the same white people as the last and i could not understand how a whole city of people could be moved so quickly
eventually i was taken on a ship across the UNknown over to england and i was UNknown before them
like a captured animal an exhibit
and so i UNknown them imitating their ways hoping that they might lose interest in this young savage but their interest only grew
so they placed me into the white man 's schools
it was there that i discovered in a book the words that you william blake had written
they were powerful words and they spoke to me
but i made careful plans and i eventually escaped
once again i crossed the great ocean
i saw many sad things as i made my way back to the lands of my people
once they realized who i was the stories of my adventures UNknown them
they called me a liar
they UNknown me
i am nobody
prepares you like ?
a big bear a medium mommy bear and a tiny little baby bear
one mornin they were gonna eat their breakfast porridge
they had a big bowl a medium bowl and a tiny little bowl
that porridge was too hot
stupid white man
william blake you go to them
along came this girl
what if they kill me ?
nobody will observe
there was a big bed a medium bed and a tiny little bed
i 'd rather not but i UNknown l go
the bears got home
what 's the best way to get down there ?
be quiet and go
and he took that golden hair and he made a sweater for baby bear
well that 's terrible
you know i just i can 't drink whiskey like i used to could
my old belly just ain 't no account
i get the UNknown every time don 't you know ?
i 'm sorry big george
i got some food here that even UNknown never tasted
i think this is gonna fix up your old gut
these beans is shit
them uh there 's possum in these beans and spices too
i tried hard
i still say you make a hell of a pot of beans
now why don 't you say us a grace outta the good book would you ?
thank you big george
this day will the lord deliver thee into mine hand ;
and i will smite thee and take thine head from thee ;
and i will give the UNknown of the host of the philistines this day unto the UNknown of the air and the wild beasts of the earth
well it 's just a real dirty person
plates clattering men UNknown
i 'm with nobody
i 'm sorry
i would if i had some
i UNknown l trade you some beans for some tobacco
i don 't have any tobacco but i 'd love some beans
is that right ?
well it 's a rose that 's made out of paper
look at the edge on that knife
i 'm really not sure
ah your hair
by god it is soft
now how do you get it that way ?
see this old stuff of mine it just well it 's just like old barn hay
there ain 't a UNknown thing you can do with it
just lucky i guess
i thought i told you not to touch me
i don 't give a good goddamn what you told me
you keep your hands off his hair
that 's got plenty to do with me goddamn it
that 's right
you had the last one
is that a fact ?
i saw him first
you had the last philistine
this one 's mine
what do you think about that ?
you gonna shoot me ?
that 's right
lord have mercy !
you son of a bitch
i 'm gonna have to kill somebody now
man in dress
i didn 't kill UNknown
i didn 't kill UNknown
your actions are useless
you know i UNknown e had it up to here with this indian malarkey
i haven 't understood a single word you UNknown e said since i met you not one single word
are you sure you have no tobacco ?
i UNknown e already told you i don 't smoke
if i don 't smoke there 's a pretty good chance that i don 't have any tobacco
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
what the hell is that ?
what 's that say ?
thanks to goddamn mr dickinson huh ?
i UNknown l tell you what that there says huh ?
it says some UNknown wearin UNknown some stinkin bean UNknown possum skinner he 's gonna collect that reward money
make you feel good ?
five hundred dollars
i mean he paid us in gold in advance
i 'm out here i 'm out here in the middle of UNknown creek with two local lunatics
one who don 't say nothin
i wouldn 't do that if i were you
and why not ?
he 's a navajo mud toy now
do you think i could have a little bite of it ?
it 's not for use even for william blake
flowers of the medicine give you sacred visions that are not for you right now
my southern brothers were prohibited from using it by the spanish devils
but now even the UNknown and the UNknown know of its loving ways
oh you 'r e so modest
to do so one must go without food and water
all the sacred spirits recognize those who fast
it 's good to prepare for a journey in this way
i seem to have misplaced my eyeglasses
i can 't see clearly
perhaps you will see more clearly without them
you 'r e a very strange man
it did lee
white legs brown ass brown sides
it did ?
well you asshole you got the damn telegram on you
take it out and look
that 's right
i UNknown l check it
maybe i been thinkin of them wanted posters
well rome weren 't built in a day cole
course uh i wasn 't UNknown that particular job
this uh some kind of telegram or somethin ?
what 's that say ?
i UNknown l wind up UNknown the bastard
looks like a goddamn religious UNknown
he was actually part of the UNknown clan
uh the uh clan UNknown was kind of gold and purple if i remember correctly
i never wore a lick of it myself
dropped the mac part of the name when he decided to come out west on account of he figured it 'd get him more work and all
how UNknown out your family history there cole ?
let me guess
i mean am i right ?
am i close ?
i insist on speaking with mr dickinson
rise now and drive your cart and plow over the bones of the dead
do you still have my eyeglasses ?
i will take you to the bridge made of waters
the place where william blake is from
where his spirit belongs
white man 's trading post
indians get diseases there
i see you have acquired a new weapon
did william blake kill this white man ?
we need a canoe
also the murders of the following territorial marshals
it 's not bad
well i want you to have it
it 's a present
how can i be of assistance my poor man ?
all our ammunition is guaranteed
this latest batch was in fact personally blessed by the archbishop of detroit
the vision of christ that thou dost see is my vision 's greatest enemy
do you have tobacco ?
we sure don 't
sure are but those cans are empty
there 's no tobacco in them
perhaps i could interest you in some beads or possibly a blanket
well i may have one or two UNknown left
from my personal supply you understand
for good friends only
yes i am
sir would it be presumptuous of me to ask you for
for your autograph ?
he already has
i see you collected some more white man 's metal
it 's time for you to leave now william blake
time for you to go back to where you came from
you mean cleveland ?
this world will no longer concern you
found some tobacco
joe UNknown led a full life
a newspaperman in the best tradition
a great credit to the fourth estate
it didn 't matter if the bombs in the war zone were falling
it didn 't matter how high up the political scandal went or how many big UNknown or small time UNknown leaned on him
whatever the risk if there was a story there
joe went after it
well i was with him when the story broke about prince charles and that made him UNknown non UNknown with the royal family
except with diana
all UNknown he did love a woman
hey did you know he started as a police reporter ?
did he ?
one of the best
no no he got it on expenses
and well we lived to write another day
everyone loved him
no but he got the information before anyone else
yeah he did
does this mean anything to you ?
lord lyman 's son
i think he 's got a real future in politics
how did you die ?
i think i was poisoned
you think ?
that peter lyman is the serial killer known to the police as the UNknown card killer
chuckles what ?
yeah i wrote an article two years ago when the UNknown killings first started
but peter lyman ?
you remember the last murder ?
the police found a clue
yes a UNknown
unusual antique wasn 't it ?
so could have the UNknown killer
the world is full of coincidences
yeah except i noticed that peter only had one left
he 'd lost the other
still although it 's a UNknown thought
did you inform the police or was that too sticky ?
i didn 't know what to do so i phoned my lawyer and i asked his advice on whether to report it or not
and i thought i heard this click on the phone you know like someone had been listening
later that day after tea
i died suddenly
i knew you 'd appreciate it when you said you were a reporter
this would be a dynamite scoop
and i got it first
there 's only last
think you could maybe
i wrote to you about getting an interview for the school newspaper
but you said if i was in london visiting then you would you know and here i am which is fantastic
i think i have your letter actually
see right now i 'm a bit tied up
here it is !
i mean you UNknown e got a huge following in rochester
it gets very cold there
with your new movie coming out in the fall and
do you mind ?
i 'm looking to move into more serious pieces
and when you say something more serious that 's
you really want to know ?
well originally i wasn 't going to go to college
i was going to become a dental UNknown like my sister beverly
and don 't get me wrong it 's a great profession
i have very high respect for teeth and gums particularly gums
my whole family 's in UNknown
our families UNknown in palm beach together
my mother won a visit to palm beach and i became friends with their granddaughter vivian
she 's so lovely
i mean what kind of a reporter am i ?
how was the sex ?
give me all the details
who knows ?
all i know is that the second it was over he got a phone call and had to leave suddenly for UNknown
what difference does it make ?
the point is i told the whole school
i 'd get an exclusive with michael UNknown !
laughlng you were nervous
but you know you 'r e a very attractive sexy girl
if you 'r e going to interview UNknown and UNknown in their hotel rooms you better watch out
not that i 'd mind a roll in the hay with michael UNknown
i UNknown e put some fresh towels in your bedroom sondra
i mean if i 'd used my feminine wiles
like UNknown UNknown or rosalind russell
oh come on
and you 'r e always saying all the men you meet are complete losers
so you blew the story
it 's not life or death
i say that from the bottom of my heart
you know every time i come to london this great city
i always get a sincere sensation because you 'r e marvelous people beautiful humans
and for my next experiment
and i call it an experiment you see not a trick
i 'm gonna need a volunteer
so if you UNknown l step out and find someone for me
this is kind of dangerous stuff so no children here
i need a grown up volunteer
someone who 's willing to put her life on the line
well you got nothing to be afraid of
UNknown you nervous ?
tell them your name
no don 't tell me
cause i got a great ear for that kind of thing
that is fantastic
i can 't tell you
it 's really
you 'r e an incredible human being and a credit to your race
sondra let me ask you a question
what do you do ?
tell them what you do
i 'm a student
for exactly what you 'd be right for
dental UNknown !
no i 'm a journalism student
you study journalism
i 'm just going to UNknown some of your molecules and split them apart
it 's not gonna hurt
i just ate
you just ate
now sondra i 'm going to ask you to step into that box and i 'm gonna have your molecules split up
i 'm gonna split UNknown m up
it 's gonna be very painless
and i 'm gonna put you back together again
don 't tickle me
you got to hear this
tell them what you said to me
no tell them tell them
audlence laughlng god bless you sweetheart
you got a fantastic sense of humor
you know if more people in the world had a sense of humor we would not be in the state we are in today
i kid you not
miss sondra UNknown
doesn 't matter

oh my god
aren 't you a journalist ?
are you ready sondra ?
i 'm joe UNknown reporter and i have the scoop of the decade about the UNknown card murder case

UNknown UNknown UNknown i 'm getting a completely negative UNknown from the blue
it 's not right
hey UNknown !
when you put me inside that box exclalms i smell a frivolous lawsuit here
you going to tell me you 'r e getting headaches now or something ?
dizzy spells ?
yeah the UNknown a spirit UNknown
you can drop the UNknown
my name is sidney UNknown
you know what i mean ?
i just go exotic to give the square UNknown a little UNknown now and then
look the spirit appeared right next to me !
at first i thought he was one of your UNknown
i don 't work with UNknown you know because you gotta pay them health benefits
but then he told me his name was joe UNknown a journalist from the land of the departed
i couldn 't believe it
i 'm a journalist he 's a journalist
i mean our UNknown must have kind of UNknown together and
you know he didn 't say that in so many words but i 'm putting two and two together here
do me a favor put two and two together someplace else because i 'm very very busy
so do you mind ?
listen i UNknown him okay ?
there is a joe UNknown and he died three days ago
now i 'm going to UNknown the molecules so let me know if anything happens you know just keep me posted
i UNknown l be right here
the molecules are whirling
i 'm a journalist at adair
i know you may have been aiming a little bit higher chuckles but i assure you whatever i lack in experience i make up for in dedication
i 'm beginning to lose patience sondra
so let 's go
come on sweetheart
i would not tell this episode to anyone else because they UNknown l take away your driver 's license
i don 't understand
i thought that
and there 's a world of departed people ?
i don 't know what you UNknown e been smoking but don 't try and bring it through customs
darling i 'm a little late
sweetheart i love you
write this down
you got a pen ?
would you hurry ?
you got that name ?
rich good looking very successful
that peter lyman is the UNknown card serial killer
now just write this down
if so that he 's murdered a dozen women
short haired brunette prostitutes
jack the ripper
that 's horrible !
that would be a disaster !
god no !
you can 't accuse anyone
let alone someone like that without substantial proof
and once you UNknown e alerted him to the suspicion
that he is under suspicion then he UNknown l be impossible to trap
chuckles not to mention doubly dangerous
there 's also a possibility that he poisoned his secretary because he suspected that she was learning the truth
no you have to get the story first but first you have to get the story right !
there 's no certainty in this or
i got a feeling in my gut about this
the kind that journalists dream about
and so far no one else has the information
chuckles oh if i was around today
i 'd find a way to get the facts and break this case wide open !
now believe me sondra
don 't blow it
possibly maybe yours
you got to help me with this
not me honey
and i 'm a journalist sitting on top of one of the biggest stories of all time !
kid you 'r e in over your head
you know what you should do ?
you should share this story
share it ?
UNknown look at her
now what kind of
i mean we got to strike !
you know this guy 's a serial killer
he could just kill at any moment !
i heard that part
you should go call the police
that 's what i 'd do
yeah and what am i gonna tell them ?
tell them that
that lord lyman 's son peter is
he suspects he 's a serial killer
uh huh and when they ask me where i got this information from ?
UNknown well tell them !
you know just say you know tell them
just explain to them that
you know say that
was that the question that you just asked ?
i would not say anything if i were you UNknown UNknown they UNknown l put you away
UNknown that 's exactly what i 'm saying
i 'm gonna say i got this information from a dead guy ?
listen this is not for me sondra
i don 't do this
i do occasional bar UNknown and kids parties
you know you 'r e barking up the wrong tree
how can we meet him ?
how can we see what we 'r e dealing with here ?
you don 't even know what the guy looks like
that 's why we 'r e here
i just couldn 't get a clear picture of him on the internet so UNknown jesus
and what are we going to do if we see him ?
i mean what are you gonna learn by looking at him ?
unless he UNknown a UNknown
i don 't know sidney
i 'm UNknown
hey why don 't you think about this as adding some excitement to your life ?
hey sweetheart excitement in my life is dinner without heartburn after it
do you have a family ?
i had a wife but she dumped me if you can believe that
now i had a great UNknown for her
i could have nailed her you know but i raised my hand and she would not call on me
i 'm telling you
we gotta start someplace
it 's a very good idea
come on !
you know if you break something here you 'r e gonna be washing dishes the rest of your life
let 's go
it 's not even peter lyman !
i told you the photos weren 't clear
sweetheart you should live and be well prosper
but without me
god love you
it 's this posh private club but daddy 's partner 's a member and members are allowed to bring guests
wow do you think i could bring someone ?
i 'm sure daddy can arrange it

how can i help you ?
we 'r e here to take a dip
oh yes yes
the pool 's downstairs

yes but when i go into the water my glasses you know float off my head into the pool
hey sidney that 's got to be him
yeah well make sure this time
cause i don 't want to swim around after another UNknown
hmm he 's very handsome
this guy is a serial killer like i play for the new york jets
how can we meet him ?
UNknown i don 't know
they have a class system
he 's an aristocrat and you know we 'r e UNknown
in fact according to his system i think we 'r e probably classified as scum
this is our only chance
he 's all alone
you know i think you could probably get this guy to get interested in you
don 't be silly
look i can 't just go up to him and say hi how are you ?
i mean what if he gets suspicious or you know if he gets put off or
i UNknown l go get scoffs listen to me !

your whole life is deception

i don 't want to get sued or deported or arrested for stalking somebody
this is a big guy you 'r e dealing with
this is a big story no kidding
that 's what joe UNknown said
that 's why he returned you know
this is his last big scoop
suddenly i 'm taking direction from a hunk of UNknown ?
this could be very big for my career
your career 's fine
you got years for UNknown
you know what ?
i don 't need you
go back to your card tricks
i didn 't say i wouldn 't help you
you know i just
you know we gotta put our heads together
if we put our heads together you UNknown l hear a hollow noise
look at this place
look at this
about 400 years
all that 's missing is a moat beautiful

there was that earl
peter why don 't you show them around ?

why don 't we get a drink and then we UNknown l start inside ?
we often spend evenings in here

chuckles it brings to mind UNknown
oh do you enjoy reading UNknown too ?
no no not the author
this was a girl i knew
what 's wrong with you ?
try to pick up clues try to remember things
i 'm charming him
i use images it 's a trick
uh huh yeah
i think of like 50 UNknown dancing on a desert island in UNknown skirts or something and then i remember
i can call it to mind whenever i
where are you going ?
this is one of the drawing rooms
wow this is really beautiful isn 't it ?
oh here we have
there 's grandfather and his wife lady hayden
reminds me of the portrait of aunt UNknown in the library no ?
game woman UNknown
come on dad
no no never have
i UNknown e taken some salmon you know
i 'm very big on the philharmonic
we sponsor in fact
but i have a number of
well actually quite a large musical collection
do you play an instrument either of you ?
because we have these lovely music gatherings
various classics you know noel coward and shakespeare and
well i play the blues harp
it 's a little metal thing you put in your mouth and makes a UNknown sound
the slightest hint of UNknown semitism and they write letters
i would love it if you could teach me how to fly fish
that would be great
okay i want you to watch me very closely
pay very strict attention here
now i want you to take a card
take any card you like
you got it ?
put the card
you got it ?
it was the six of hearts
six of hearts
was it this six of hearts ?
but i just put that in my bag
well check your card
i mean that sincerely
from the bottom of my heart i say this with all due respect
you 'r e a wonderful
a credit to your race and a magnificent group of people
you know i must find out who does the hedges here
back home my UNknown moose is starting to look a little shabby around the antlers
laughlng what do you do mr spence ?
UNknown me ?
i 'm sorry i 'm in oil !
i 'm in oil
it 's become a problem
incidentally i accept your invitation
i will play poker this weekend
now that i UNknown e seen how good you are at cards can we trust you ?
this is all so new to me
well what would you like to know ?
well i don 't know
anything you 'd care to reveal
you know your hopes your dreams
well i come from a privileged family as i 'm sure you can tell
it was always decided one day i would enter politics
my hobbies are polo and
oh i own some racehorses
chuckles and what are your hopes and dreams ?
i like to dance and visit museums and oh i can cook chinese food
oh i UNknown e gotten very interested in new age phenomena recently
like what ?
i find that if
i 'm a good dancer
oh i would love that
that would be great
and since you like chinese food
i 'm gonna have my new secretary send you a list of the great ones in town
oh you have a new secretary ?
my previous secretary died a young woman just very suddenly of a blood clot
it was awful
how did we get on to this morbid subject ?
so you UNknown e never seen a real english garden before ?
would i offend you if i told you something ?
well i just can 't seem to get the vision of you in your UNknown out of my mind
oh i 'm glad you liked it
it was marked down
you just have this very direct and informal way about you
i UNknown l stop
you just were getting warmed up
are you romantic by nature ?
i mean i won 't say do you believe in love at first sight ? because that 's a UNknown but
have you ever had an experience where a bell goes off just right away ?
i don 't like to put my finger on my UNknown
and stop telling people i sprang from your loins
i 'm trying to cement the fact that i 'm your father !
that guy was so fantastic
i can 't imagine he 'd do anything bad
this guy is not a serial killer believe me
i 'd be very surprised if he even killed one person
he asked me to go dancing next week
that 's a perfect strategy !
you worm your way in like a UNknown or a UNknown and as the crumbs fall off the table you collect them and we analyze them
how do you know this is his ?
what do you mean how do i know it 's his ?
i stole it out of his overnight bag
what the hell is wrong with you sidney ?
it 's a clue !
it 's not a clue
we 'r e hard up for clues
it 's not a clue
what does it mean ?
it could be his aunt it could be his travel agent
i 'm late for dinner
you want to come in and eat something ?
he said to start without him
oh well come on then let 's play
that 's what we 'r e here for

so sorry old chaps
mr spence is a good poker player peter
yes i might have known
actually i bought my first reuben 's with poker winnings
you bought a UNknown painting ?
not a painting
he asked me if i believed in love at first sight
exclalms how sweet is that ?
i told him we had nothing in common
we come from completely different UNknown
i think he likes that or something
but what about the story you 'r e writing on him ?
what is that all about ?
was strangled at UNknown place last night at 9 30
next to the body of the short haired brunette prostitute
was the hangman card from the UNknown deck
hey what time did you say peter arrived at the poker game last night ?
if you 'r e asking me did he have time to strangle somebody and make the card game yes he had plenty of time
i got to let my feelings UNknown and probe deeper into this case
what does that mean ?
well it means that we know where his family lives we know his social circle but we don 't know what his house looks like
i want to get a look at that
i 'm embarrassed to say that i do
you must think i 'm an empty UNknown
much of it 's political
oh i recognize that from my art history books
oh it 's very beautiful
is it roman or greek or something like that ?
it 's roman in fact
second century a d
the real treasures

i don 't know where they get these people but she looked like sitting bull
and i got her in the thing and i vanish her and everything goes according to plan exactly and she 's gone
and suddenly UNknown appears
i got a tremendous hand from the audience
i wish i could do it every night !
what did he say ?
he gave me the combination to a safe
what safe i have no idea
i didn 't see any safe
well did you accomplish anything besides maybe a possible pregnancy ?
i UNknown l tell you what i did see
his mother lady eleanor has short cut brunette hair
UNknown yeah but not a hooker ?
no sidney she 's not a hooker !
i hardly think so
your brain !
i 'm just trying to figure out the various UNknown
i just don 't like this whole thing !
i feel disgusting all right it 's awful
i don 't like the whole process
yeah you want to think he 's innocent
what 's so bad about that huh ?
jesus this guy must be some lover you know
i mean all of a sudden you 'r e ready to dump the whole story
i must find out what breakfast cereal he eats
what am i talking about ?
there 's a combination on the door where he keeps his precious musical instruments
okay so there is a combination !
i just got to get in that room
do you have the combination ?
we 'r e not gonna break into his room if that 's what you 'r e thinking
you gotta have the com
i got to get in there
this guy is the son of a lord !
they UNknown l take us to the tower of london and behead us !
i assume your name is jade spence ?
naturally i accepted for you
yeah i 'm jade spence
what is going on ?
well he certainly seems smitten with you
if he 's smitten with anyone it 's jade spence
who is jade spence ?
a would be UNknown reporter who 's falling in love with the object of her investigation
i want you to think of a card
just think of one of those cards
any one you want
that 's amazing !
just a little hobby of mine
you know i wish i had more time to practice but what with my oil wells you know i never get around to it
your daughter 's very beautiful
you met my daughter ?
she 's a lovely girl
UNknown a great handicap
her mother and i took her to many specialists you know
now she 's practically normal you know
she 's a charmer
i 'm an UNknown
and what is your persuasion ?
do you mean my religion ?
yeah your persuasion
oh i was just about to pull some quarters out of mrs quincy 's nose
what is wrong with you ?
you 'r e supposed to be a dignified businessman
i told them it was a hobby
the hobby of a rich merchant
you know so
i UNknown l keep peter busy
i UNknown l meet you down there in a minute
you brought the combination right ?
no i left it in my other jacket
you gotta go home and get it then
i can 't get it because the other jacket 's in the cleaners
but not to worry
i remember everything
UNknown yes a great time !
this reminds me of our party
we threw a masked ball in palm beach this year it was wonderful
i came as a UNknown
she dressed as petunia pig
honey there 's something i wanted to ask you about
do you need a drink mr spence ?
no i 'm fine thank you
UNknown it 's eight blue horses
no no no
chuckllng eureka !
i 'm just gonna use the bathroom
for some reason it 's gone out of my mind
i thought i saw her going downstairs
it 's 21 jet planes
and 12 UNknown
check the door
my UNknown system failed me
what do you want me to say ?
now exactly what are we looking for in here ?
this is all
you 'r e not sure ?
well you know don 't break anything
by god we UNknown l get caught and god knows
hey you know the old dirty joke about how the french horn player sleeps with his wife at night ?
sidney put that thing down !
will you excuse me ?
there 's nothing but musical instruments in here
i 'm telling you we 'r e on a wild goose chase
did you hear that ?
i thought i heard something
oh come on come on
let 's get out of here
all we need is to get caught in here
the guests will be leaving soon
yes well i was just showing father around
he loves english homes
i have a wonderful cellar myself
no wine but it 's UNknown free
please mr spence i haven 't seen you with a drink all night
can you stay the night please ?
you 'r e too beautiful
UNknown look at you
what are you doing ?
i couldn 't sleep so i thought maybe some milk
what are you gonna tell the police ?
the guy owns a deck of UNknown cards
that 's not a crime
i mean what he was late for a poker game ?
i 'm sure he 's smart enough to have an alibi
what are we left with ?
his mother has short cut brunette hair
i mean look if we blow the whistle on this guy
then he realizes that you 'r e you know you 'r e a UNknown little phony who 's been playing him for a sucker and he dumps you you know
i get it
especially about lord lyman 's son
you don 't make an accusation
we can phone in an anonymous tip
you know how many crank tips the papers say the police get ?
you 'r e gonna phone one in on peter lyman !
they UNknown l hang up on you mid sentence
besides if the story 's true
i want to be the one to break it
you know what joe UNknown said ?
he said get it first but first get it right
oh yes well i can understand that but i think we 'r e both still young enough to enjoy the gifts
come on open it
you like it ?
no i 'm too tough to cry
oh don 't be sad
it 's your birthday
i just have to go out of town for a few days
but we UNknown l celebrate when i get back all right ?
it 's beautiful
i UNknown l take you for a magnificent dinner
we UNknown l go to a great restaurant
what about indian food ?
do you like spicy food ?
no no it 's okay
i don 't really have much of an appetite
but you will when they bring out the UNknown in UNknown acid
it 's fantastic sondra
what are you thinking of peter ?
i wouldn 't be surprised if he asked me to marry him one day you know ?
you come from an orthodox family
would they accept a serial killer ?
that 's an expensive present
the UNknown are so wealthy
i 'd better get ready
i still haven 't found my millionaire yet
it 's starting to add up against him
bits and scraps are coming together
god it 's you !
i sensed you were falling in love
i escaped again
a coincidence here and there
too much smoke not to be fire
look i 'm sure you UNknown e been wrong plenty of times
not wrong here
if you act UNknown not only does he walk your professional UNknown is wrecked sometimes for good
oh i 'm sure you want him to be guilty
you know that way you get your last big scoop
i 'm beginning to fade
sondra don 't let me down !
i wish you 'd fade for good !
get out of my life !
i 'm not cut out for this
i should be UNknown UNknown for a living
the bread is
i can do a whole meal just nothing but bread
if i ate that much bread i 'd be 20 pounds heavier
see i never gain an ounce because you know my anxiety acts like UNknown
so i get the exercise
thanks for taking me out for my birthday sidney
well you know you 'r e the daughter that i never had
oh that 's so
i 'm kidding
i didn 't
could i live in london ?
because it you know it 's on the wrong side and i
every time i drive a car here
i 'm convinced i 'm going to die in a crash
it 's peter
well that 's what he told me
UNknown i ordered UNknown
all i do is
i don 't know whatever he 's doing he must want it to be secret
oh i told you he went the other way !
can we go home please ?
it 's starting to rain
groans i can 't believe he lied to me
maybe he 's doing something that he 's ashamed to tell you about
maybe he belongs to one of those clubs or he 's a cross dresser or something
or maybe he does folk dancing
oh i 'm sure it 's probably something that when he tells me
i UNknown l just feel foolish for thinking he lied
i 'm sure
you know just practically everything
groans that indian food made me sick
you hardly touched your cobra salad
how can you be sick ?
help call the police !
there 's been a murder !
have you got a phone ?
call the police
they found a UNknown card
it 's him
she lives in this building
it 's him again
elizabeth gibson another short haired brunette
slghs we should have gone to the police earlier
well you know
sidney it 's about time we show my story to a real newspaperman
by real you mean what ?
one that 's living
well it 's very vivid and rather shocking and there are some genuine circumstantial bits of evidence
but let me give you a lesson in professional journalism
no newspaper should or would ever run this story
all you have here are a number of UNknown UNknown
UNknown theories that UNknown a man and a well known figure at that without a single shred of substantial proof
so his mother was a short haired brunette
so he came late for a poker game and said he was going away on a business trip and he got caught lying
yes but who keeps a UNknown deck under a french horn ?
it 's not against the law to own a UNknown deck or keep it wherever you like
you 'd look pretty foolish in court with your accusations and that 's where you UNknown l wind up
because he 'd have no choice but to sue you and the newspaper and he 'd win
and to go to the police ?
i UNknown l come to that
but first let me continue my tedious UNknown lecture
vivian 's dad and i go way back
he said you were a journalism student
okay you won 't disclose your source but what you have done is let your imagination run wild
the late joe UNknown ?
we didn 't say it was before he died
chuckles well why did he give it to you ?
he didn 't know he was dying
i don 't buy it
i knew joe UNknown well
if he 'd had a tip that he considered reliable he would certainly have pursued it himself from the grave if necessary
what about how peter was in the neighborhood the night the murder was committed ?
hey she is onto something !
this kid is a bloodhound
look at her !
i want to tell you how UNknown for everybody involved it would have been if you had say taken the results of your investigation to a UNknown
today the police have apprehended the UNknown card serial killer
and it most UNknown is not peter lyman
it was a UNknown named henry banks who has confessed
banks is a UNknown paranoid who 's given scotland yard information that only the killer could possibly know
he 's led the police to two additional bodies and his dna and a fingerprint they found check out
i know this puts a UNknown in your scoop but henry banks is the UNknown card serial killer
not lord lyman 's son
well i can 't say i 'm not walking on air
oh jesus if i ever catch that joe UNknown i UNknown l kill him
i only hope peter forgives me for what i UNknown e done
for what ?
i 'm a UNknown UNknown ambitious college student
i lied to him over and over
darling he lied to you too so it 's even
his lies pale in comparison to the UNknown of what i UNknown e done
so marry him as jade spence
don 't tell him
marry him as jade spence
yeah but i don 't want to have to get you a father 's day gift every year
you know i don 't know how to break this to you honey but you were adopted
it 's lovely
oh god so do i
oh well let me go first
actually no let me please because mine 's been bothering me all day
i just want to get it off my chest
when i told you i was going away for a few days on business
i was lying
with your father ?
it 's a very sensitive situation and the less anyone knows about it the better
and we just didn 't want the press to sniff it out
i mean that 's no excuse really
i 'm just very sorry for the extreme secrecy
no no no it 's fine
i 'm glad
that 's fine
i mean how UNknown
my name is not jade spence
it 's not ?
his name is sidney UNknown
he 's a magician called UNknown
i 'm a journalism student
don 't ask me what kind of crazy UNknown we received to believe you might be the UNknown card killer
UNknown i mean i didn 't know you at this time
i knew that it couldn 't possibly be true
and the police have him now so everything 's fine
of course along the route i fell for you and now i totally blew it and
who told you this ?
oh a newspaperman
oh i 'm so sorry
i just totally understand if you never want to speak to me again or if you don 't want to see me
i love it
i can 't wait to tell the chaps at the club
chuckllng peter ?
how do you know about that ?
i was so paranoid
i bought them for you
they 'r e victorian UNknown cards
you told me you were into that kind of thing
oh you 'r e so
i feel like such an idiot !
darling no no no never mind never mind
what a shame
and i assure you in advance i UNknown l love it
UNknown oh god you snuck into my music room did you ?
so the reason why he was UNknown around was UNknown UNknown he had this private family business which is too delicate to discuss actually
sorry i don 't buy it
and i say that with all due respect
don 't call me that all right ?
do you remember when we were out on the estate
i found a clue you thought i was nuts ?
i thought you were nuts so many times i can 't recall the exact one
do you remember this ?
do you remember this little item ?
this clue ?
the one that was killed the night we saw peter on the street was named clears throat elizabeth gibson
oh come on sidney
you 'r e reaching now
look supposing you wanted to rub somebody out and not get caught
nobody wants to get caught sidney
look he wants to get rid of elizabeth gibson
a UNknown card
he buys a UNknown deck and let 's say he hides it
UNknown he hides it let 's say in a music room
let 's say he hides it in let 's say a french horn
i 'm losing patience with you
i 'm not saying the guy did all the murders
i 'm saying that he just did elizabeth gibson then folded it into the series of the UNknown killer so he wouldn 't get caught
henry banks confessed to all the murders
henry banks is deranged !
he UNknown !
henry banks you know
the cops will dump every unsolved murder on henry banks
they haven 't caught anybody in years
peter wouldn 't hurt a fly
oh really ?
because it looks terrible on his resume
who knows what kind of sordid life this guy has ?
have you completely lost your mind ?
what is wrong with you ?
peter being blackmailed by a prostitute ?
it 's ridiculous
you don 't understand !
it would kill his reputation !
oh can you bring the water out ?
can i just tell you one thing ?
joe UNknown would not agree with you
i don 't want to talk about joe UNknown all right ?
even a great reporter can be wrong
but he 's not wrong
you are a cynical UNknown who always sees the glass half empty !
no you 'r e wrong
i see the glass half full but of poison
and you 'r e gonna wind up drinking it !
you don 't know anything
you don 't have a reporter 's instincts okay ?
you 'r e some guy who vanishes silk handkerchiefs and cuts people 's neckties off
do everybody a favor
did you tell her ?
i know i 'm right
she just won 't listen to me
she hates me
i don 't think i UNknown l be seeing you anymore
well if there 's a scoop to be had here she 's going to get it for you
you can only cheat death so many times and i UNknown e used every trick i know
you look after her
and check his UNknown deck
see if a card 's missing
i didn 't know her
i hardly ever saw her come and go
she was quiet
but whether she used to entertain her clients here or not i couldn 't say
if there 's any comments anything you know about her that i
what paper ?
did you see
no no we are we are
we 'r e doing a big story
the travel and leisure section is doing a big spread on places to avoid like the plague
and so i 'm
all right all right all right
i knew betty gibson
but i don 't think that she deserved to die
did you say betty gibson ?
everyone called her betty
she was very sexy
she used to be a really pretty baby faced blonde
you know the sort men go nuts for
a blonde ?
oh no i know i know
she made the mistake of cutting it off and UNknown it black
god knows why
she had steady clients ?
well yeah one for sure
look these guys never use their real names okay ?
but there was this one rich kid that she saw a lot
and his name was peter
peter what ?
where have i called ?
oh hello sidney
you could have come
may i speak with her ?
yes one second
i just was snooping with
on elizabeth gibson
a special relationship with some young guy peter
the last name doesn 't click but i 'm sure it 's the same
this is crazy
the case is closed
you 'r e alone up there with a very very dangerous man
that 's two UNknown
sidney if i thought there was a shred of proof
i would never let my personal feelings get involved all right ?
the truth is i 'm crazy about the guy
i can 't keep UNknown over UNknown conspiracy theories
you know i 'm sure that he killed her and made it look like a UNknown killing
you know you don 't see it because you got stars in your eyes
look i don 't
it 's too upsetting for me all right ?
let me have my nice weekend
i UNknown l talk to you when i get back
stop putting these paranoid thoughts in my head !
is sidney okay ?
he 's got a part missing you know he 's crazy !
yes really ?
let me change okay ?
and i 'm gonna be driving up there later and she asked me if i could pick up her red UNknown sweater
she thinks she left it upstairs
red UNknown ?
it 's a kind of a red tomato red
like a fire engine
i play a few pieces myself on the violin
UNknown and UNknown the
yes but he wanted to share it with me because you know in case something happened you know life is very capricious
a stroke a sudden UNknown or lightning
you know i
and i mean that
i notice you didn 't get the red sweater
she probably left it in another bedroom
you know she 's got a little problem with UNknown
i UNknown l call you
we UNknown l have lunch
mr lyman sir mr spence has been here and he 's been into the music room
what do you mean ?
a most unusual sequence of events
mr spence came by looking for his daughter 's sweater
said she 'd requested it
next thing i knew he was in the music room
sir i think he 'd been drinking from his behavior
there 's trout in the lake
what are you thinking about ?
you really want to know ?
i mean in my own defense there really was no other way out
at first i managed to hide my identity from her but i saw her too many times over the years and she learned who i was and
well it became a constant demand for money and i just could not let that go on could i ?
i mean my whole life and career would be just hostage to her moods at all times
so i studied the UNknown case
i rehearsed my plan and well you know the rest
if you do something to me sidney 's gonna find out !
he UNknown l tell someone
no no no
no one knows of your relationship with him because after all you 'r e not actually father and daughter are you ?
and no one will think twice to investigate the death of some obscure UNknown
are you listening ?
this is the advantage of a private lake
get off me !
i need the police immediately
at the lyman estate
a woman has drowned
i 'm so sorry sir
when last i saw her she
she just said she wanted to go out there to communicate with nature
just to think she wanted some peace and quiet and
she wasn 't depressed or anything like that was she sir ?
you heard no cries for help ?
slghs it 's just so ironic
because the way i first met her
i rescued her from drowning in our club pool
and she was a very very weak swimmer
actually i used to be captain of the brooklyn community swim team
well this upright chap certainly enjoyed UNknown some UNknown women
unfortunately for elizabeth gibson she elected to blackmail him
it 's a beautifully written story and one of the best bits of UNknown journalism in a long time
and this paper is proud to run it
oh i have to share the credit with joe UNknown
an inspiration who taught me more than i could ever explain to anyone
and to the late sidney UNknown
sidney wherever you are
UNknown you know i was driving up to the country and in the united states i would have been a hero
i would have saved her
i would have
granted the theater 's better there 's many good indian restaurants
well what did you do ?
what do i do ?
i 'm UNknown
oh yes please
i 'm going to show you a little trick now
i just want to say from the bottom of my heart i mean this sincerely
i say this with all due respect
you are a wonderful group and a fantastic group of people
i love you and i feel that coming back from you
and you may be deceased but you should not be discouraged
because you know
you know when i was a child i UNknown
but with stick to it UNknown and UNknown you know you can never tell what could happen
now i want you to take a card alma
go ahead take any card you want
just pick it
tube socks or crew socks ?
what are we in the mood for tonight ?
why are we using the royal we ?
i wonder if the post office keep records of people 's address changes
i mean detectives track people down
how do they do it ?
all right it 's official
i UNknown e been on the night shift too long
we 'r e talking to ourselves like the other one 's not there
i 'm sorry
what 'd you say about a detective ?
somethin about your dad ?
until i do i won 't know how he lived all the UNknown
or how he died
like he found you in that dream
what for ?
yeah the one who acts like he 's UNknown the place
yeah he made all those weird threats about you know there being angry spirits down there and some serious darkness in UNknown
all right wait a minute
you 'r e not really worried about us like we 'r e in danger ?
definitely not with jim clancy out there in his uniform so
go to work
are you ready for breakfast ?
i 'm buying ?
yeah sure what is it ?
look we brought this girl in with uh UNknown acid UNknown flooding her UNknown and that result was acute UNknown
that would have been really interesting had it been in english
but see it sounds a little crazy to say in english that i think i think this girl was almost scared to death
all right according to one of her friends before she lost consciousness the last words out of her mouth were bloody mary
bloody mary ? like the drink ?
no like bloody mary the ghost
oh you mean bloody mary the urban myth
i don 't know
you tell me
i mean look at her face
somethin scared her
i don 't know what to think
tell me everything you know about bloody mary
are you kidding me ? you 'r e like the UNknown person that 's asked me about bloody mary today
whatever area the myth takes place in well you change the myth to fit local UNknown
so what 's the UNknown u version ?
well it starts the usual way
you look into a mirror
you say her name a few times over and over and over again and then all of a sudden bloody mary appears behind you
well here 's a hint
could i talk to you guys for a second ?
uh who are you ?
m my husband is the UNknown who brought her in
well anything that you can remember
did somebody hear her say bloody mary right before she lost consciousness ?
um well we weren 't there so we don 't know anything
we just came when we heard that allison um that she she got sick
well you can talk to me
i 'm not one of the police and i don 't work for the university so but we don 't have anything to say
we weren 't there so we don 't really know
she heard the noise
i think that i might be able to help you but you have to help me
i need to know more about allison
like did anyone around her die recently like family or close friends ?
what does that have to do with anything ?
that 's hard to explain
ok i don 't mean to be rude but unless you 'r e a doctor or a family member you need to leave us alone
ok see that is the thing about bloody mary
there are so many legends that you can have 2 in one town
so there 's the UNknown u version and now there 's a UNknown version also ?
yes but technically the UNknown university version UNknown from the town version
i mean that that 's why my students went so crazy
when they found out they had their own local ghost
i mean they are you sure you don 't wanna light candles ?
this story is way better with atmosphere
get to it
ok uh look mary lived in UNknown about 150 years ago
she was a UNknown she got a disease and she goes to the doctor after slipping into a coma
the doctor declares her dead
you know where this is going ?
to the end of the story
anyway mary goes into the ground and they tie a string around her hand runs up to the surface which is attached to a bell on top of the ground
that way if she ever wakes up cause she 's not really dead
then she a dead ringer
they get hammered
they see that the bell is as the kids say off the hook
they have to dig her back up
they open the coffin lid
except now it 's way too late
she 's really really dead
and get this
that 's it ?
you 'r e like my students
ok so i do agree that it might have something to do with a ghost
i did see something in allison 's hospital room but i definitely don 't think it has anything to do with bloody mary
why would a century old ghost show up and UNknown UNknown ?
maybe she was tired of getting her bell rung
whatever is or isn 't haunting allison is about her but i i 'm not gonna know what she saw until she wakes up
you mean if she wakes up
that myth does not prove that anything is gonna happen
jen you gotta get real
if people are dumb enough to believe in ghosts then guess what
you know it 's like they deserve to get scared out of their minds
it 's like they basically asked for it
allison did not ask for that
she 's not in a coma cause she saw bloody mary
please would you please not say that name ?
please don 't
how did you hear about this so fast ?
i mean is it already on the net ?
i came back to my office and you know me
i hear an ambulance i come running
i 'm pretty sure you told me this wouldn 't happen again no ?
will you just show me where it happened ?
i 'm paid to be a UNknown
i 'm just running out of reasons to doubt the myth
well here 's a reason
i see ghosts
and that 's the mirrors
i 'm not forgetting it
i 'm ignoring it the bell the rest of it
it all makes a good story
it doesn 't make it real
it 's ok
i UNknown l take it from here
where are we going ?
this is it
and while we 'r e on the subject of things you don 't know
let me give you my UNknown lecture on mirrors and their place throughout history and the supernatural
like the first queen elizabeth she had her own personal magician who would use a mirror to describe the future
and the greeks
uh this is the UNknown version ?
yes but you just made it a little bit longer
the greeks thought that any UNknown surface would do
they even believe that unsuspecting uh souls could be pulled underwater by evil spirits lurking underneath the water
i guess i did
because UNknown throughout space and time have always believed that mirrors are uh sort of a veil between our world and others
uh a portal if you will
ok so let 's say that bloody mary uses mirrors as portals
d UNknown the bell
who you gonna call the next time you have a ghost UNknown up your works ?
who i should have called all along
ok we could do this face to face but mirrors are your thing
hey what do you wanna do with this UNknown UNknown clock ?
are you ok ?
i thought so
how do you know about her ?
are you kidding ?
all his friends are into it
it 's all so ridiculous
why do these kids wanna do this ?
what scare themselves ?
you have to face something that feels like death you come out the other side and then suddenly you feel so alive
they 'r e all talking about what happened to UNknown
look at what this person says
how many people do you want to get hurt before you learn ?
signed s a
allison some girl named claire and sloane alexander the friend from the hospital who told me she didn 't know anything about bloody mary
and here 's sloane 's UNknown
see what ?
you 'r e not laughing
i 'm so sorry
i have 2 friends in the hospital
i 'm probably next
ancient spirits don 't usually jump out of mirrors and try to kill people
number 2 ghosts can scare you but they can 't do more than that unless you let them
we can stop this together but you have to help me figure out who she is and and why she would wanna do this to you
for a second there i actually believed you
i actually thought i might be ok
you will be ok
why should i help you ?
you don 't know what you 'r e talking about
you 'r e wrong about everything
the legend is all true every detail
you call bloody mary you hear the bell she comes through the mirror and then you die
yeah but no one has died
it 's just a story
you 'r e wrong
just before semester break we were talking about UNknown and stuff what kids were saying about bloody mary
she 's real
and allison swore a roommate of her ex boyfriend 's had actually seen the ghost
and when he looked up in the mirror bloody mary was like staring right back at him
i swear it
i UNknown l do it
we were kind of impressed actually
the rest of us couldn 't get out of the bathroom fast enough
i UNknown e never heard any of this
well it was last spring and the university doesn 't exactly advertise UNknown UNknown on campus
for wha UNknown people thought maybe it was a drug overdose
but you knew better
it was like mary knew we were back
like she was watching us
there were all these weird noises
there was stuff we thought we were seeing in mirrors
and you think all this happened because you called out a ghost 's name ?
well rachel called her but it was our idea and now mary 's coming for everyone there who helped wake her up
look i understand how you feel no you don 't
you don 't understand anything
ok maybe i don 't
but will you at least let me help you ?
you don 't have to do this alone
no it 's too late now
my best friends are gone and i 'm probably next and anyone i told would think i was nuts
sloane please don 't do this
i 'm sorry
ok well if you change your mind
she was picked up in UNknown hall UNknown transferred to mercy declared UNknown and she died 4 days later
so what was the cause of death ?
complications from heart failure
yeah sure if it 's bad enough
you get this flood of chemicals to your heart creates a shock some people can 't survive
aw that 's just delightful
oh it gets worse
we haven 't had a single test positive for any medical cause for their UNknown states
well all the rumors online are getting crazy
it 's like this thing has a life of its own
oh babe i don 't UNknown to tell you your job
i won 't do that
but we got the 2 girls in the hospital
they 'r e serious
is it possible it could be the myth ?
i don 't believe it
you don 't believe it or you don 't want to ?
what does that mean ?
all it means is if it 's true there 's a whole lot more to this ghost world than you got a handle on
you know if it 's true maybe your your ghost down in the archives is tellin the truth
what that there 's some kind of darkness in UNknown ?
for the 10 UNknown time today there are no such records i know of so kindly look elsewhere
i 'm gonna be going this way
you 'r e UNknown
yeah you told me that before
now you hear what i just said to the UNknown
what do you wanna tell me ?
you can 't just leave the dead to rest can you ?
i UNknown l let them rest when they let me rest
do you know something or not ?
she 's real but not everything you UNknown e heard is true
some of the most interesting details are missing
such as ?
it was mary 's own father
they lived in the big house on oak shadow lane
it 's empty now but it was once the home of dr
horace UNknown his wife and their only child mary
poor mary had UNknown which was incurable in those days not to mention extremely contagious
dr UNknown felt they had UNknown his daughter right away
with the chance that the bell might ring mary 's mother UNknown not leave the grave
well the good doctor knew that she would die of exposure if she didn 't come inside
luckily he had some morphine
well you know the rest
by the time they got to mary she was dead by the doctor 's own hand
you 'r e right
you see when they finally got mary up her hands were so bloody they missed it at first
mary 's nails were gone
they were stuck in the lid of the coffin
don 't you wanna talk to someone after all these years ?
so i guess now i owe you a favor
yeah and 138
i know you 'r e here
i know that we UNknown e been in the same UNknown UNknown
do you know why you 'r e here ?
why aren 't you looking at me ?
i don 't believe it you you actually saw bloody mary the the real thing ?
well i don 't know if i believe it either
i mean i was at her family home
i said her name 3 times
maybe the archive ghost got his facts wrong
yeah maybe but there 's something else
the bell it sounded off you know
like it didn 't sound like a 100 year old bell
well honey i don 't think cast iron bell technology has changed much
no it didn 't sound real
you know clipped like
i don 't think this is a century old ghost
all right you 'r e back to believing the ghost is someone who knew the girls someone who died someone who had unfinished business
one of the girls
2 are UNknown one is convinced that she 's next but only one girl died the first one rachel
you 'r e saying that our daughter rachel died from playing what ?
well it 's kind of a ghost story that was spread and now has taken on a life of its own
i i 'm sorry miss uh UNknown
we sent our daughter to college
we let her live in the dorm even though we were a half hour drive away and which i knew was a big mistake
i wouldn 't ask you to remember any of this if it weren 't for her friends at the hospital
they need your help
i don 't know
well she never mentioned any of those names
and why was that ?
my wife will tell you that that was my fault
well that 's not rachel was different from other kids
it 's a UNknown defect a hole between the chambers
and she knew about that ?
from the time that she was a child which was why we could not allow her to play sports
she had to be home UNknown
we took every precaution
absolutely 24 hours a day
and how did it work ?
when her heart got too UNknown it would UNknown a sound
what kind of sound ?
you know like an alarm
i can help you now
it doesn 't matter
they 'r e picking me up tomorrow
yeah but you don 't have to do this
bloody mary is not after you
the ghost is rachel
i saw what UNknown and allison saw and i 'm still here to talk to you about it
you 'r e gonna be dead in 4 days
rachel had a heart condition and the excitement or the fear or whatever it is that happened in that bathroom it was too much for her body to take
but i heard the bell
no what you heard was her heart monitor
she had a condition and the scare is what killed her
oh my god
that 's why she did what ?
that 's why she came for us
that 's why she 's saving me for last
when allison said she knew someone who 'd seen bloody mary
i thought she was just lying to scare us so why not return the favor ?
she was so quiet
ok i 'm bored already
i 'm gonna go to bed
but i didn 't i didn 't mean to hurt anyone
yeah but rachel didn 't know that
so i did this
she needs your help to move on
you say that like is she here ?
no but i think i know where she might be
where did it happen ?
in the hall bathroom
please let me help you
rachel stop it
that 's what happened
sloane didn 't know that you were gonna take that dare
none of them did
doesn 't matter now
she was a different girl buried alive by her parents
so was i
is she gone ?
i can 't find it
where is it ?
this was never your home
you have to remember who you really are
you have to remember how this all started
look at your hands
your heart stopped because you were scared
i couldn 't breathe
then i saw her sloane
saw how i scared her how i scared them all
and that fear that they felt i knew that feeling so well
and they look at me now and they 'r e the ones who are frozen in fear
you mean allison and UNknown
i 'm with them all the time
i can go anywhere do anything
i never have to rest and my parents they can 't stop me anymore
so that 's why you understood mary
you knew what it was like to be buried alive
but somewhere along the way you lost who you really are and who you were to everybody who really loved you
i can help you but you have to let mary go
i know it 's hard to accept
i don 't care if you think that you can see spirits or or UNknown
i UNknown e heard enough
tell him i drove his UNknown into a tree
she wants you to know that she drove your UNknown into a tree
oh my god she was only 13
lisa what 's she talking about ?
there was a blizzard
she made me promise never to tell
she let me drive the UNknown around the yard
that was a bad idea
there was a UNknown and
i let her drive your UNknown
i thought she 'd be sitting and her heart would be safe
this is gonna sound really lame but
i think that was the best day of my life
she wants to thank you for that day
tell him safety is UNknown
she said that safety is UNknown
sometimes it 's better to let things go no matter what happens
i let go of rachel and look what i got
tell him that he gave me the best gift he could ever give me my freedom
she knows you miss her but she wants you to understand how happy you made her
i wanted her alive
she was alive
she 's right
um this is sloane
she looks just as scared as i was
is that how you want her to stay ?
she forgives you
this light are you feeling this ?
what is she saying ?
she 's saying she 's free now
she 's saying good bye
it 's ok
are you happy ?
and the crickets have returned to my classroom
i 'm doing my lectures for nobody practically ok and the stark raving terror that had this town in its UNknown is now just gone all because of you
well i 'm so sorry
i should UNknown e known how it would affect you
you know i was thinking of letting you skate on that 138 you owe me but now i UNknown e changed my mind so pay up
what something from here ?
some of this junk ?
do i have blue hair ?
do i live at the end of the block with 15 cats ?
any 35 mm
manuel UNknown a UNknown UNknown preserved one copy which was given in the late 60 's to the national arts fund
in UNknown technician fernando UNknown UNknown made a 16 mm
UNknown from that 35 mm
copy which was later destroyed
that UNknown is currently preserved by the national film museum and it was used for this edition
the screening speed was adjusted the colour tones were improved
also some UNknown formerly UNknown due to poor contrast were also restored
even after my death
shadows and memories sleep under the peaceful UNknown
in each gravestone a story a name a date
if only the most private tragedies of those standing by the graves could be read too !
here lies elvira UNknown may she rest in peace
that morning a man and a child were standing by a humble grave
what a sad memories they seemed to be UNknown !
the man was mature
the child was a spring like portrait of the man
a string of UNknown stroke the man 's spirit
in just a few minutes
his tortured mind went through twelve years of memories
rosario 25 september 19
i UNknown e already spoke about her
she 's well educated and reliable
she 's may serve you to works of trust
she 's an orphan and has no friends or relatives
this is the key
please recommend her for some good decent UNknown
thank you very much
UNknown o wouldn 't want to graduate as some quack doctor
he was almost turning into an old man before graduating
mrs UNknown de UNknown the widow of three captains dead during the war against UNknown
she earned her own living by providing lodging for guests
they were lacking of wine
add some water to it
dear mrs UNknown de UNknown
it is with great honor that i hereby recommend
miss elvira UNknown our cashier
she wishes to stay at your house where she will feel as home
this piece of junk won 't awake anyone else !
this UNknown was thrown at me from your house
who stays at the higher floors ?
i UNknown l deal with them
not only they don 't pay the rent
they also damage my reputation !
that UNknown was not thrown at the soup UNknown but at my head !
l UNknown l punish these punks terribly !
the students took position with their own artillery
if this gentleman insists in UNknown this lady
i UNknown l kick him so hard
that his own family won 't be able to recognize him
he invented an UNknown UNknown device
its effects are quite remarkable
please see for yourself
what are you laughing about mr bad manners ?
starving to death
appetite has a good nose
do you like candies and pastry boys ?
we sure do !
yes dad !
chocolate cream and pastry for my little children
get your finger out of your nose !
you can 't hit me !
you 'r e not my real dad !
what are you doing here ?
a little help from someone who cares about you
at the restaurant the check turns to be UNknown o 's worst dessert
l forgot my wallet at home !
please let my children wait here while i go and look for it
give them whatever they order
UNknown comes with a full stomach
UNknown o goes to his class
at 7 00 p
have your dad forgot about you ?
that wasn 't our dad
he offered us candies and UNknown if we call him dad !
another tall story !
luis was able to quench his thirst and hunger at a friend 's table
then he met elvira after work
our family sent us money
please have 100 pesos so you can give us some food
elvira decides to go further
do you remember this ?
haven 't your families sent you money again ?
it 's late
the good elvira walks with them to the university
she makes sure that they actually attend their classes
her UNknown makes her be late for work
the indignant manager UNknown her terribly
thanks to his willingness luis becomes friend of rich and wise professor doctor UNknown UNknown
months later this friendship between master and disciple makes luis a frequent companion at the doctor 's elegant table
meanwhile at the humble UNknown elvira gets luis clothes ready
m when UNknown o sent me to bed
what a long dinner !
were you thinking of me while eating ?
l left two shirts and six pairs of socks ready for you
the evening goes on in the luxurious living room
the aristocratic girl not the orphan
elvira was waiting for you
seeing that you didn 't arrive she left this note
the alcohol and the devil are the enemies of good actions
the alcohol and the typical foolishness of a 20 years old make luis conceive a strange criminal idea
the sleep always stands by the good people and fell upon this kind soul like a gentle caress
what 's all this ?
you 'r e not worthy of her kind actions
or my friendship
tell her you 'r e sorry !
young people get confused
rude boys always get through the first open door they find
what an UNknown young man !
l never thought he might do something like this !
doctor UNknown UNknown pays attention to his daughter 's UNknown pleading
please invite luis to my birthday
he 's a really fun guy !
if that 's your wish i UNknown l be very glad to invite him
UNknown o and luis are UNknown at the maternity hospital
doctor and surgeon UNknown UNknown gladly invite his disciple and friend luis to a private dinner celebrating his daughter maria esther 's birthday on next saturday
UNknown o lend me 500 pesos !
l need them i must buy a gift
the hospital has a holly mission and UNknown o works UNknown
l implore you to provide me with 500 pesos please
the bearer of this letter will receive the money
see it for yourself
you cheated my sister so lowly !
forgive me sir !
the unhappy woman returned to the UNknown
l have a terrible headache
she UNknown herself from her sorrow and shame with good old UNknown o
we must return that money
an accusation would be terrible !
we must help her
we all make mistakes
please sign this bill for me
this will teach you to be a man not a villain !
the emotions of such a UNknown day make delicate elvira fall ill
unaware of all the damage he caused
luis returns to the UNknown
l 'm so ashamed !
don 't be
the man who UNknown of a na ve self sacrificed woman is not a man !
it 's a cynic !
this violent UNknown with his friend UNknown UNknown o to change rooms
there he goes with his things
in his blind ambition luis only cares about that gift he bought at someone else 's expenses
l feel ill
elvira discovers a terrible secret
the sinister idea of death perhaps a comforting idea in such unfortunate days came to the mind of this impulsive poor soul
luis fate does us apart
l wish you can be happy with the woman you love the woman you abandoned me for
good bye forever
she doesn 't know that she 's a rival
UNknown his triumph the drunk frivolous student dresses up for such a joyful party
dear UNknown o luis doesn 't love me anymore
l now know that he even made a thief of me to give another woman a gift
my only wish was to live for him and with him
given his love for another woman my only destiny should be death
my good and loyal friend this is my final farewell
l recommend the UNknown of miss elvira UNknown UNknown 21 years old regular height thin white blond blue eyes
UNknown 21 years old regular height thin white blond blue eyes
no news ?
few months later
the outcome i feared the most is now becoming true
l 'm having a child and i 'm getting fired !
help me for god 's sake !
only in public charity that poor good soul finds help
reserve an UNknown bed for me
i have an examination tomorrow
she 's in god 's hands
one more life and death meet face to face
the fact of trusting you
UNknown her face in the last moments
seeming like a final comfort
do you know who is she ?
no not you !
she donated her body to him and by being good even after her death she won his heart definitely
the loyal UNknown o UNknown poor elvira 's last wish
look after the child commanded him both the dead woman and his own kindness
and there he was a complete father as gentle to the child as a mother could be
don 't cry little boy
tears should not turn into sorrow the joyful dawn of your life
nor frighten your happiness away
as mine was when your mother felt in love with another man
the UNknown is over now
that man was dr luis rodriguez who had come back from exile
and his child now grown up and educated by dr UNknown o
they visited the grave of their beloved woman and pulled the petals off the eternal flowers of memory
even after my death the end

i will take care of him then i know which of the two men
paid with his life just as happened at the whim of the roman circus ?
she took the train south
but soon giorgio lost her trail
and he returned from UNknown
one day and giorgio thought no more of her
but a few days later
but as a UNknown lover the good diplomat was a failure
why haven 't you been here more often ?
my permission ? !
but take a pleasure trip
or request a UNknown to the embassy in washington or UNknown
friday at countess UNknown 's
giorgio my friend i know it is painful but you are making yourself out to be a ridiculous figure
go on go home
i UNknown e kept it because i know you are a fair pianist and the music drives away my headache
do you want to catch your death of cold ?
going out uncovered in the cold night air ?
is it important to you ? !
you are cruel !
lovers of the stars
and UNknown became as UNknown and as obedient as a little girl
and in the quiet warmth UNknown found comfort
i love you !
do you feel better ?
if i were polite to you you be so too
please write what you said just as if you thought it
in a memory of this evening which we spent together playing romeo and juliet
it 's useless because i UNknown e already written it for the last time
would i be your lover ?
would you like me to give myself to you
tomorrow evening UNknown deliberately
your fatal charms !
have you had a good time in the carriage with the fresh girl ?
i 'm not sorry and now it 's late
you need to know !
sit down !
the police wanted him
there was a gulf between us dizziness caught us
my husband did not love me
he was absent
he knew where i was
do not try to see UNknown again
he was deported !
i knew that he had been driven to distraction like you !
and crazy i rode i rode
that man loved me truly in his own way
as in the manner of the rest of you
he saw me anyway at the cost of his life
at that moment i could not forgive the man who could kill me
he who was filled with so much dignity and guilt
after four days and four nights of rest he had recovered
when i left the bed i was UNknown
he 's dead ; i shall soon die
that 's what love is !
tell me at least
giorgio did not see her any more
countess i know you are unwell and i am very sorry
first there is the fact of an event by the enemy which requires me to leave without kissing your hand
by order of the minister i must immediately leave for the embassy in lisbon
i must go now
the first act of the opera UNknown UNknown
and the melody UNknown to the heart of the suffering UNknown as if by a magic wire
the famous duet of act ill
oh sweet UNknown love 's noble desire
but the UNknown applause of the audience required the singers to
stop singing melody thus breaking the thread and her soul felt broken !
and so in the shadows suddenly without UNknown a syilable
i despise myself
i UNknown l be ready to leave tomorrow morning count
giorgio when we last parted i knew that that would be our last goodbye
i have responded and i wanted to UNknown in your arms as jealous as a tiger
i love you !
i say this in order to drive this word like a nail into your heart
as i have driven your picture like a nail into mine
you know that little remains of this life for me !
i want to die near you
i am crying on my knees to you !
i say this in order to drive this word like a nail into your heart
as i have driven your picture like a nail into mine
hoping to forget most easily the woman he loved
giorgio gets engaged
the beloved 's voice calls unnecessarily
mr UNknown is not available
UNknown chooses to die in the grand hotel UNknown theatre
the wing of the hotel where UNknown prepares to die UNknown with UNknown life
countess i am sending you the drug you want
it is only a temporary convenience for your UNknown
it will extend your life but not for long
but remember no more than three drops in 24 hours
with respect dr UNknown
and her cheeks burned with the UNknown flame and the eye of the ancient splendor
woe to him that pushes open this fatal door !
more of that cordial more a few more drops !
and the glow of the drama of passion in the theater brought the crowd to applaud the dance of fire
tell me how beautiful ?
tell me !
little by little the beautiful body entered the veil of death
the short circuit
and in the splendor a fiery sunset
UNknown 's UNknown love for her adored giorgio UNknown returned her to youth and life

apparent drug overdose four st angelus students at a party
three boys age 17 and a 16 year old girl
the uh boys were UNknown at the scene
girl was UNknown and transferred to columbia UNknown
what kind of poison are we talking about ?
we don 't know sir
it 's a new one to us
some kind of designer drug called m cat
do we know the source ?
well we 'r e chasing it down now boss
setting up operations in suspected buy areas
conducting full enforcement sweeps
how 's she doing ?
what else ?
you 'r e entitled to a life
you did right j t
press will be all over this
keep me UNknown
police officer ?
my head 's fuzzy
what drugs ?
where 's billy ?
maybe i better get a doctor
where is he ?
i 'm sorry
she was asking what happened to her boyfriend
i don 't know what to tell her
so you told her ?
i didn 't know what to say
i need to ask you a few questions though
this isn 't real
we got to figure out how this happened
do you recognize this ?
it was supposed to make you feel good
do you know where billy got the stuff from ?
i don 't know anything about any of this
i don 't do drugs
it was just this once
you 'r e a lucky young lady
what happened to the other guys that billy gave it to ?
they didn 't make it
do you understand ?
did you hear any names ?
did anyone say anything to you ?
no nobody said anything to me
they don 't talk to me
caitlin and the others
look your mom 's on her way
you 'r e gonna be all right
nice work kid
i 'm sorry danny
sometimes you 'r e damned if you do you 'r e damned if you don 't
i heard about what you did
saving her life
we don 't know yet
we have to wait on the UNknown screens back from the deceased and the residue on the UNknown so
freaking designer drugs on the street nowadays
it 's a wonder these kids even know what they 'r e putting up their noses
we have to lean hard on every kid at that party to find the dealer
let 's start with the one who threw the party
in the city alone
there 's six of us
i told you UNknown village for chinese and then the movie
you can 't see this movie in park slope ?
it 's at the film forum
it 's a classic
i bet dad would let me
okay this is me UNknown my reins
you can go but you better come back in one piece or i swear i will kill you myself
also the dad bit that will never help your cause
do you understand ?
i know kids that go there
my daughter does not do drugs
well we know she didn 't take those drugs because she 's not dead
now caitlin can you tell us who billy romero bought the drugs from ?
no she can 't
no i can 't
three people died in my apartment
i have to live with that
can 't you see you 'r e upsetting her ?
this is not her fault
look if you want to play the blame game
i 'd hold you responsible
i trust caitlin
it was those kid who took advantage of her
there 's a reason that the legal age of majority is 18
now you 'r e an adult
act like it
i UNknown e done nothing illegal
a 16 year old can be left alone in a secure building
now are we done here ?
no we 'r e not done here
caitlin i 'm going to ask you one more time
where did billy get that drug ?
i said i don 't know
this is outrageous
everybody at that party could be charged for possession of an illegal substance
so just be glad you were away on business or i 'd arrest you
now sit your ass down
caitlin you still say you don 't know anything ?
who sold billy that drug ?
someone at school
i think they buy it at school but i 'm telling you the truth
i don 't do drugs
that 's good for now
i 'm surprised i didn 't lose any nerve endings the amount of time father peter whacked me across the knuckles with a ruler
hm well you 'r e looking at the UNknown of the christian leadership award four years running
well until i discovered boys that is
and then i was hiking up my uniform skirt
sister beatrice caught me one day and she said the shorter the skirt the longer the confession
don 't listen to him ladies
i know what you people face out there in the city but this is st angelus
none of our students are dealing hard drugs
do you have any idea who this person is ?
that 's what we 'r e here to find out
that 's not to say that some incidents of marijuana and alcohol use don 't occur okay but vice principal hoffman here is trained and she knows the signs
i test if i see fit
and get those few proper help
we don 't have any
it 's not in our budget
and the lord handles surveillance here at st angelus
and you have 450 students here so we simply don 't have the time
but the school UNknown here are on school property
so we 'd like to take a look at them with your permission of course
you want to search everyone 's locker ?
well three kids are dead father
i mean if you want to cause an epidemic
of course not
talk to my superior
it 's a long way from st UNknown 's
for both of us
the police need access to st angelus high school your excellency
please understand commissioner giving permission to open those UNknown has UNknown
are they more important than seeing that more kids don 't die ?
our parents are protective of their children
if we open the UNknown and treat everyone as a suspect there will be outrage and rightly so
you are criminal by association
by the mere fact that you attended school at st angelus
we need to find out who is manufacturing this drug and seize it
we need to find out who else has it
if we open the UNknown how many parents will pull their kids from st angelus ?
and then there will be one less catholic high school
i don 't want to have to get a court order
it will get out
with respect you can 't afford to be seen to be sweeping another problem under the rug
i UNknown l call father leo
thank you father
what do you got ?
locker 300 another 20 sack of weed
that would be tom ryder
he 's in english classroom 5 c
looks like we found something
what do we got here ?
oh false bottom
glad you can still feel something
three other people are dead
UNknown at UNknown general
not to mention the countless drug charges you 'r e facing
you understand what that means kid ?
now the only way i can help you is if you help me get this poison off the streets
i need the name of your UNknown and the names of any kids you sold the m cat to
wayne give me a name
i didn 't sell to billy
not this time at least
okay who did ?
i don 't know his name
i never met him
timely comics 1949
well it 's bogus
who knew ?
okay okay listen the math you 'r e killing me kid
make an order all right ?
how about 500 ?
sending parcel post at chelsea cod four dollars
parcel post means the mail slot in chelsea
four dollars means it will be waiting for me by 4 00 p m
yeah except it will be waiting for us
good work kid
what kind of question is that ?
an honest one
he was hot
so he 's hot so you just did it too huh ?
we always pushed boundaries back then
the kids today the boundaries they 'r e pushing though so much more dangerous
i just messenger
i just messenger senorita
okay tell you what tell us where this came from we won 't kill you
come here and cuff this mutt
what for ?
you might have got away
you all right ?
this guy UNknown has got a major drug lab in the back
a lot of high end bicycles
hey keep him down here
i 'm gonna put the cat back in the bag
what 'd you lace it with arsenic strychnine ?
you have your facts wrong detective
my brand is pure
i 'm a businessman
oh we 'r e gonna test it believe me
now get him outta my face
since that new UNknown came out but we 'r e on it boss
tomorrow 's press conference has been pushed to 1300 hours and then there 's the UNknown dedication at the police athletic league boxing gym
i imagine you 'r e wanting to wear the uniform for that
what about m cat ?
we 'r e waiting for lab results to come back
well they have
oh you know
hey it 's one beer with your brother all right ?
the old man always said to celebrate your victories
you saved a girl 's life
feel good about it
to the good guys
give me the less bad news
all right the od 's in queens UNknown heads
there 's no connection
it was a lethal dose of potassium chloride
i 'm not really a science geek
it 's a common chemical used in UNknown and and water UNknown
it 's not used in UNknown drugs
they also use it in death row inmates for lethal injections
my three months on the innocents project
that UNknown 's a real son of a bitch huh ?
it 's not UNknown
neither one had potassium chloride
UNknown didn 't put it in there who did ?
the only thing i 'm thinking is that maybe
billy wanted a bigger high and put it in there
maybe somebody else did looking to kill
if that 's true we UNknown e been coming at this all wrong
was it billy UNknown alyson you know one of the friends all four of UNknown m ?
the only person we can ask at this point is alyson UNknown
i 'm gonna go ask alyson now
cause she just got run down on riverside drive going out for a UNknown
you buy next time kid
she 's one lucky girl
she turned and saw it just in time
car clipped her took off
alyson detective reagan
you remember ?
i don 't know
something made me turn back and there was a car coming straight at me
did you see the driver ?
the headlights were in my eyes
how about the car ?
could you make out the model or make ?
it was medium sized uh dark color
it wasn 't an UNknown or anything
new york license plate ?
it all happened so fast
i think i did see a bumper sticker for my school though
i don 't know i could be imagining it
and from what you 'r e telling us now
looks like they tried to hurt you again
oh my god this can 't be happening
look is there anyone you can think of who may have wanted to do something like this to billy to you
caitlin hates me i know that
because of billy ?
you said she hates you
yeah well i 'm all over her hate book
hate book ?
some of the girls have them
they 'r e like UNknown of everyone they hate
i saw it once in UNknown class
there 's some really mean stuff
about billy too
her me and billy were in the same class
it 's hard to believe that caitlin UNknown is capable of murder
she can be difficult moody but
look at this
it 's not in anyone else 's
you know what it is ?
yeah i know
potassium turns violet when over heat
looks like somebody 's catholic school education paid off
by they way hate book
wait UNknown l you get a load of this
i wish that bitch was dead
her and billy both
read this yet dad ?
okay what about with alyson ?
she had billy and you wanted him
no i didn 't want billy anymore
i dumped him okay ?
that 's not what we heard
well all billy ever wanted to do was have sex and get high and it got worse
you two had sex ?
he said it would bring us closer
and i mean i 'm sorry but if you 'r e dating me you don 't need chemicals
and he even admitted to it but he wouldn 't tell me who it was
and i didn 't care anymore anyway
oh so he had a secret lover
all right so where were you between 6 00 and 7 00 last night ?
caitlin has UNknown on friday night
i went shopping in soho
you lied about that too ?
can you verify that ?
can anyone verify that ?
do you have any receipts from your little shopping trip ?
you can ask sara and rachel
they UNknown l tell you everywhere i went
or if you have an account you could go back and follow me yourself
you can follow her on UNknown
she told you to follow her on UNknown
look we got the hate book we got motive yeah
yeah her alibi from last night is very thin
all right we UNknown l check out her alibi
we UNknown l squeeze her friends
if her story doesn 't pan out then we nail her
how do you protect your kids from that ?
we learned about drugs in school mom
oh you knew about that huh ?
i 'm your father
i took UNknown m down to the tombs and locked UNknown m in
what 's the tombs ?
and you guys had all the fun
yeah dad did the same thing to me when i turned 11
he did ?
you know a lot of people think drugs should be made legal
yeah a lot of crazy people
yeah well that 's california
what do you expect ?
well it 's not legal here
and for good reason
i 'm just saying there 's no scientific proof that some drugs are more harmful than say alcohol
well there 's an argument to be made for UNknown
there 's a stupid argument for UNknown
you just watched three kids die
and you you know kids who knew these kids
if drugs were UNknown like alcohol and standards were quality controlled deciding who can sell it and to whom
and to whom ?
where do you get these theories ?
you sit around your dorm in college smoking pot with your buddies and you just come up with this crap ?
look at least UNknown would know what they 'r e getting ; UNknown and dealers would be out of business ; maybe these kids would be alive
we should be able to do what we want
it 's a free country
that 's a little UNknown honey
no it 's not
you think i don 't know that ?
you never take me seriously
i 'm sorry grandpa
she treats me like a child
oh you 'r e not mad at her because she changed her mind about letting you go into town
nobody else could go either after what happened at that party just
she never talks to me
i mean really talks
you know the other night when you were going to the gala she was crying the whole way over to your house and she wouldn 't tell me why
well maybe she 's trying to be strong for you right now
knowing how upset you are about the divorce
maybe your mom was thinking about her
just like you need your mom your mom needs you
to look out for her to understand her and love her
life isn 't fair
look at this
6 07 p m
so last year
and it 's at the exact same time that alyson UNknown was hit with the car miles away
assuming it was caitlin that was sending the UNknown
who ran down alyson ?
what about that secret lover caitlin was talking about ?
if she even exists
well whoever it was they tried to kill alyson UNknown twice so what do they say ?
third time 's the charm ?
let 's hope not
that 's worth a shot
well maybe it is
well you can tell the concerned parents we 'r e investigating a triple homicide at their children 's school
and also a hit and run on alyson UNknown
by examining cars ?
would you happen to know who may have a st angelus bumper sticker on their car ?
the way things are going i won 't be able to give them away
yeah it 's tough stuff father
well that 's just it
looks like somebody removed the bumper sticker here and ran this car through a wash
yeah like a hit and run trying to cover tracks
car 's registered to vice principal carol hoffman
what can you tell us about vice principal hoffman ?
the students love her
she ever have any UNknown issues with billy romero ?
not that i 'm aware of
any UNknown we should know about ?
well he can thank her for not UNknown out UNknown year
how so ?
she UNknown him in science ?
yeah she was a chemistry teacher
before i promoted her
we appreciate it
well actually uh we 'r e not looking for anything
we just wanted to ask you a few questions
why don 't you have a seat ?
i really should be getting back to my office
oh it won 't take long
so father leo says that uh you taught chemistry here
good student ?
he did some extra credit
ms hoffman you 'r e an intelligent woman
i think you know what we 'r e getting at with these questions
i 'm going to go get father leo
no no no
shut your mouth
you 'r e UNknown ?
he was so disgusted with himself that he had to take drugs just to have sex with you ?
is that it ?
i begged him
i told him he was making a big mistake
so if you couldn 't have him then no one could ?
he wouldn 't even look at me !
he wouldn 't talk to me
i didn 't think he 'd share it
to have somebody
i didn 't need to see him all the time just once in a while
let 's go
or am i just UNknown for a time that never existed ?
little bit of both i think
and human UNknown
heal the wounded bind up those who are bruised and reclaim the sinners
the UNknown motto above my door at st UNknown 's
easy to say
he 's agreed to let me hold a press conference
no more sweeping things under the rug
you may need divine intervention
the press will be more interested in creating heat than shedding light
if you UNknown l have me i would like to stand with you father
just as you UNknown e always been there for the UNknown
thank you francis
UNknown dumped an identity theft on my lap as i was trying to make my escape
i 'm sorry that i missed dinner
you didn 't miss dinner

pops and grandpa and i made dinner

hm well you 'r e looking at the UNknown of the christian leadership award four years running
well until i discovered boys that is
and then i was hiking up my uniform skirt
sister beatrice caught me one day and she said the shorter the skirt the longer the confession
don 't listen to him ladies
i know what you people face out there in the city but this is st angelus
none of our students are dealing hard drugs
do you have any idea who this person is ?
that 's what we 'r e here to find out
that 's not to say that some incidents of marijuana and alcohol use don 't occur okay but vice principal hoffman here is trained and she knows the signs
i test if i see fit
and get those few proper help
we don 't have any
it 's not in our budget
and the lord handles surveillance here at st angelus
and you have 450 students here so we simply don 't have the time
but the school UNknown here are on school property
so we 'd like to take a look at them with your permission of course
you want to search everyone 's locker ?
well three kids are dead father
i mean if you want to cause an epidemic
of course not
talk to my superior
for both of us
the police need access to st angelus high school your excellency
please understand commissioner giving permission to open those UNknown has UNknown
are they more important than seeing that more kids don 't die ?
our parents are protective of their children
if we open the UNknown and treat everyone as a suspect there will be outrage and rightly so
you are criminal by association
by the mere fact that you attended school at st angelus
we need to find out who is manufacturing this drug and seize it
we need to find out who else has it
if we open the UNknown how many parents will pull their kids from st angelus ?
and then there will be one less catholic high school
i don 't want to have to get a court order
it will get out
with respect you can 't afford to be seen to be sweeping another problem under the rug
i UNknown l call father leo

it was a lethal dose of potassium chloride
i 'm not really a science geek
it 's a common chemical used in UNknown and and water UNknown
it 's not used in UNknown drugs
they also use it in death row inmates for lethal injections
my three months on the innocents project
that UNknown 's a real son of a bitch huh ?
yeah and that 's the worse news
it 's not UNknown
neither one had potassium chloride
UNknown didn 't put it in there who did ?
the only thing i 'm thinking is that maybe
billy wanted a bigger high and put it in there
maybe somebody else did looking to kill
if that 's true we UNknown e been coming at this all wrong
was it billy UNknown alyson you know one of the friends all four of UNknown m ?
the only person we can ask at this point is alyson UNknown
i 'm gonna go ask alyson now
cause she just got run down on riverside drive going out for a UNknown
you buy next time kid
she 's one lucky girl
she turned and saw it just in time
car clipped her took off
alyson detective reagan
you remember ?
i don 't know
something made me turn back and there was a car coming straight at me
did you see the driver ?
the headlights were in my eyes
how about the car ?
could you make out the model or make ?
it was medium sized uh dark color
it wasn 't an UNknown or anything
new york license plate ?
it all happened so fast
i think i did see a bumper sticker for my school though
i don 't know i could be imagining it
and from what you 'r e telling us now
looks like they tried to hurt you again
oh my god this can 't be happening
look is there anyone you can think of who may have wanted to do something like this to billy to you
caitlin hates me i know that
because of billy ?
you said she hates you
yeah well i 'm all over her hate book
hate book ?
some of the girls have them
they 'r e like UNknown of everyone they hate
i saw it once in UNknown class
there 's some really mean stuff
about billy too
her me and billy were in the same class
it 's hard to believe that caitlin UNknown is capable of murder
she can be difficult moody but
it 's not in anyone else 's
you know what it is ?
yeah i know
potassium turns violet when over heat
by they way hate book
wait UNknown l you get a load of this
i wish that bitch was dead
her and billy both
read this yet dad ?
okay what about with alyson ?
she had billy and you wanted him
no i didn 't want billy anymore
i dumped him okay ?
that 's not what we heard
well all billy ever wanted to do was have sex and get high and it got worse
you two had sex ?
he said it would bring us closer
and i mean i 'm sorry but if you 'r e dating me you don 't need chemicals
and he even admitted to it but he wouldn 't tell me who it was
and i didn 't care anymore anyway
oh so he had a secret lover
all right so where were you between 6 00 and 7 00 last night ?
caitlin has UNknown on friday night
i went shopping in soho
you lied about that too ?
can you verify that ?
can anyone verify that ?
do you have any receipts from your little shopping trip ?
you can ask sara and rachel
they UNknown l tell you everywhere i went
or if you have an account you could go back and follow me yourself
you can follow her on UNknown
she told you to follow her on UNknown
look we got the hate book we got motive yeah
yeah her alibi from last night is very thin
all right we UNknown l check out her alibi
we UNknown l squeeze her friends
if her story doesn 't pan out then we nail her
how do you protect your kids from that ?
we learned about drugs in school mom
oh you knew about that huh ?
i 'm your father
i took UNknown m down to the tombs and locked UNknown m in
what 's the tombs ?
and you guys had all the fun
yeah dad did the same thing to me when i turned 11
he did ?
you know a lot of people think drugs should be made legal
yeah a lot of crazy people
yeah well that 's california
what do you expect ?
well it 's not legal here
and for good reason
well there 's an argument to be made for UNknown
there 's a stupid argument for UNknown
you just watched three kids die
and you you know kids who knew these kids
if drugs were UNknown like alcohol and standards were quality controlled deciding who can sell it and to whom
and to whom ?
where do you get these theories ?
you sit around your dorm in college smoking pot with your buddies and you just come up with this crap ?
look at least UNknown would know what they 'r e getting ; UNknown and dealers would be out of business ; maybe these kids would be alive
we should be able to do what we want
it 's a free country
that 's a little UNknown honey
no it 's not
you think i don 't know that ?
you never take me seriously
i 'm sorry grandpa
she treats me like a child
oh you 'r e not mad at her because she changed her mind about letting you go into town
nobody else could go either after what happened at that party just
she never talks to me
i mean really talks
well maybe she 's trying to be strong for you right now
knowing how upset you are about the divorce
maybe your mom was thinking about her
just like you need your mom your mom needs you
to look out for her to understand her and love her
life isn 't fair
look at this
so last year
and it 's at the exact same time that alyson UNknown was hit with the car miles away
assuming it was caitlin that was sending the UNknown
who ran down alyson ?
what about that secret lover caitlin was talking about ?
if she even exists
well whoever it was they tried to kill alyson UNknown twice so what do they say ?
third time 's the charm ?
let 's hope not
that 's worth a shot
well maybe it is
well you can tell the concerned parents we 'r e investigating a triple homicide at their children 's school
and also a hit and run on alyson UNknown
by examining cars ?
would you happen to know who may have a st angelus bumper sticker on their car ?
the way things are going i won 't be able to give them away
yeah it 's tough stuff father
well that 's just it
looks like somebody removed the bumper sticker here and ran this car through a wash
yeah like a hit and run trying to cover tracks
car 's registered to vice principal carol hoffman
what can you tell us about vice principal hoffman ?
the students love her
she ever have any UNknown issues with billy romero ?
not that i 'm aware of
any UNknown we should know about ?
well he can thank her for not UNknown out UNknown year
how so ?
she UNknown him in science ?
yeah she was a chemistry teacher
before i promoted her
we appreciate it
well actually uh we 'r e not looking for anything
we just wanted to ask you a few questions
why don 't you have a seat ?
i really should be getting back to my office
oh it won 't take long
so father leo says that uh you taught chemistry here
good student ?
he did some extra credit
ms hoffman you 'r e an intelligent woman
i think you know what we 'r e getting at with these questions
i 'm going to go get father leo
no no no
shut your mouth
you 'r e UNknown ?
he was so disgusted with himself that he had to take drugs just to have sex with you ?
is that it ?
i begged him
i told him he was making a big mistake
so if you couldn 't have him then no one could ?
he wouldn 't even look at me !
he wouldn 't talk to me
i didn 't think he 'd share it
to have somebody
i didn 't need to see him all the time just once in a while
let 's go
or am i just UNknown for a time that never existed ?
little bit of both i think
and human UNknown
heal the wounded bind up those who are bruised and reclaim the sinners
the UNknown motto above my door at st UNknown 's
easy to say
he 's agreed to let me hold a press conference
no more sweeping things under the rug
you may need divine intervention
the press will be more interested in creating heat than shedding light
if you UNknown l have me i would like to stand with you father
just as you UNknown e always been there for the UNknown
thank you francis
UNknown dumped an identity theft on my lap as i was trying to make my escape

loud and UNknown complaint
hey pancake what say we break out the UNknown board ?
double or nothing
what 's with the dark cloud ?
she thinks she 's too old to be baby sat
you know when you were 14 you were doing the baby sitting

we don 't know sir
it 's a new one to us
some kind of designer drug called m cat
do we know the source ?
well we 'r e chasing it down now boss
setting up operations in suspected buy areas
conducting full enforcement sweeps
how 's she doing ?
what else ?
you 'r e entitled to a life
you did right j t
press will be all over this
keep me UNknown
police officer ?
my head 's fuzzy
what drugs ?
where 's billy ?
maybe i better get a doctor
where is he ?
i 'm sorry
she was asking what happened to her boyfriend
i don 't know what to tell her
so you told her ?
i didn 't know what to say
i need to ask you a few questions though
this isn 't real
we got to figure out how this happened
do you recognize this ?
it was supposed to make you feel good
do you know where billy got the stuff from ?
i don 't know anything about any of this
i don 't do drugs
it was just this once
you 'r e a lucky young lady
what happened to the other guys that billy gave it to ?
they didn 't make it
do you understand ?
did you hear any names ?
did anyone say anything to you ?
no nobody said anything to me
they don 't talk to me
caitlin and the others
look your mom 's on her way
you 'r e gonna be all right
nice work kid
i 'm sorry danny
sometimes you 'r e damned if you do you 'r e damned if you don 't
i heard about what you did
saving her life
we don 't know yet
we have to wait on the UNknown screens back from the deceased and the residue on the UNknown so
freaking designer drugs on the street nowadays
it 's a wonder these kids even know what they 'r e putting up their noses
we have to lean hard on every kid at that party to find the dealer
let 's start with the one who threw the party
in the city alone
there 's six of us
i told you UNknown village for chinese and then the movie
you can 't see this movie in park slope ?
it 's at the film forum
it 's a classic
i bet dad would let me
okay this is me UNknown my reins
you can go but you better come back in one piece or i swear i will kill you myself
also the dad bit that will never help your cause
do you understand ?
i know kids that go there
my daughter does not do drugs
well we know she didn 't take those drugs because she 's not dead
now caitlin can you tell us who billy romero bought the drugs from ?
no she can 't
no i can 't
three people died in my apartment
i have to live with that
can 't you see you 'r e upsetting her ?
this is not her fault
look if you want to play the blame game
i 'd hold you responsible
i trust caitlin
it was those kid who took advantage of her
there 's a reason that the legal age of majority is 18
now you 'r e an adult
act like it
i UNknown e done nothing illegal
a 16 year old can be left alone in a secure building
now are we done here ?
no we 'r e not done here
caitlin i 'm going to ask you one more time
where did billy get that drug ?
i said i don 't know
this is outrageous
everybody at that party could be charged for possession of an illegal substance
so just be glad you were away on business or i 'd arrest you
now sit your ass down
caitlin you still say you don 't know anything ?
who sold billy that drug ?
someone at school
i think they buy it at school but i 'm telling you the truth
i don 't do drugs
that 's good for now
i 'm surprised i didn 't lose any nerve endings the amount of time father peter whacked me across the knuckles with a ruler
hm well you 'r e looking at the UNknown of the christian leadership award four years running

setting up operations in suspected buy areas
conducting full enforcement sweeps

you 'r e entitled to a life
you did right j t
press will be all over this
keep me UNknown
police officer ?
my head 's fuzzy

where 's billy ?
maybe i better get a doctor
where is he ?
i 'm sorry
she was asking what happened to her boyfriend
i don 't know what to tell her
so you told her ?
i didn 't know what to say
i need to ask you a few questions though
this isn 't real
we got to figure out how this happened
do you recognize this ?
it was supposed to make you feel good
do you know where billy got the stuff from ?
i don 't know anything about any of this
i don 't do drugs
it was just this once
you 'r e a lucky young lady
what happened to the other guys that billy gave it to ?
they didn 't make it
do you understand ?
did you hear any names ?
did anyone say anything to you ?
no nobody said anything to me
they don 't talk to me
caitlin and the others
look your mom 's on her way
you 'r e gonna be all right
nice work kid
i 'm sorry danny
sometimes you 'r e damned if you do you 'r e damned if you don 't
i heard about what you did
saving her life
we don 't know yet
we have to wait on the UNknown screens back from the deceased and the residue on the UNknown so
freaking designer drugs on the street nowadays
it 's a wonder these kids even know what they 'r e putting up their noses
we have to lean hard on every kid at that party to find the dealer
let 's start with the one who threw the party
in the city alone
there 's six of us
i told you UNknown village for chinese and then the movie
you can 't see this movie in park slope ?
it 's at the film forum
it 's a classic
i bet dad would let me
okay this is me UNknown my reins
you can go but you better come back in one piece or i swear i will kill you myself
also the dad bit that will never help your cause
do you understand ?
i know kids that go there
my daughter does not do drugs
well we know she didn 't take those drugs because she 's not dead
now caitlin can you tell us who billy romero bought the drugs from ?
no she can 't
no i can 't
three people died in my apartment
i have to live with that
can 't you see you 'r e upsetting her ?
this is not her fault
look if you want to play the blame game
i 'd hold you responsible
i trust caitlin
it was those kid who took advantage of her
there 's a reason that the legal age of majority is 18
now you 'r e an adult
act like it
i UNknown e done nothing illegal
a 16 year old can be left alone in a secure building
now are we done here ?
no we 'r e not done here
caitlin i 'm going to ask you one more time
where did billy get that drug ?
i said i don 't know
this is outrageous
everybody at that party could be charged for possession of an illegal substance
so just be glad you were away on business or i 'd arrest you
now sit your ass down
caitlin you still say you don 't know anything ?
who sold billy that drug ?
someone at school
i think they buy it at school but i 'm telling you the truth
i don 't do drugs
that 's good for now
i 'm surprised i didn 't lose any nerve endings the amount of time father peter whacked me across the knuckles with a ruler
hm well you 'r e looking at the UNknown of the christian leadership award four years running
well until i discovered boys that is
and then i was hiking up my uniform skirt
sister beatrice caught me one day and she said the shorter the skirt the longer the confession
don 't listen to him ladies
i know what you people face out there in the city but this is st angelus
none of our students are dealing hard drugs
do you have any idea who this person is ?
that 's what we 'r e here to find out
that 's not to say that some incidents of marijuana and alcohol use don 't occur okay but vice principal hoffman here is trained and she knows the signs
i test if i see fit
and get those few proper help
we don 't have any
it 's not in our budget
and the lord handles surveillance here at st angelus
and you have 450 students here so we simply don 't have the time
but the school UNknown here are on school property
so we 'd like to take a look at them with your permission of course
you want to search everyone 's locker ?
well three kids are dead father
i mean if you want to cause an epidemic
of course not
talk to my superior
it 's a long way from st UNknown 's
for both of us
the police need access to st angelus high school your excellency
please understand commissioner giving permission to open those UNknown has UNknown
are they more important than seeing that more kids don 't die ?
our parents are protective of their children
if we open the UNknown and treat everyone as a suspect there will be outrage and rightly so
you are criminal by association
by the mere fact that you attended school at st angelus
we need to find out who is manufacturing this drug and seize it
we need to find out who else has it
if we open the UNknown how many parents will pull their kids from st angelus ?
and then there will be one less catholic high school
i don 't want to have to get a court order
it will get out
with respect you can 't afford to be seen to be sweeping another problem under the rug
i UNknown l call father leo
thank you father
what do you got ?
locker 300 another 20 sack of weed
that would be tom ryder
he 's in english classroom 5 c
looks like we found something
what do we got here ?
oh false bottom
glad you can still feel something
three other people are dead
UNknown at UNknown general
not to mention the countless drug charges you 'r e facing
you understand what that means kid ?
now the only way i can help you is if you help me get this poison off the streets
i need the name of your UNknown and the names of any kids you sold the m cat to
wayne give me a name
i didn 't sell to billy
not this time at least
okay who did ?
i don 't know his name
i never met him
timely comics 1949
well it 's bogus
who knew ?
okay okay listen the math you 'r e killing me kid
make an order all right ?
how about 500 ?
sending parcel post at chelsea cod four dollars
parcel post means the mail slot in chelsea
four dollars means it will be waiting for me by 4 00 p m
yeah except it will be waiting for us
good work kid
what kind of question is that ?
an honest one
he was hot
so he 's hot so you just did it too huh ?
we always pushed boundaries back then
the kids today the boundaries they 'r e pushing though so much more dangerous
i just messenger
i just messenger senorita
okay tell you what tell us where this came from we won 't kill you
come here and cuff this mutt
what for ?
you might have got away
you all right ?
this guy UNknown has got a major drug lab in the back
a lot of high end bicycles
hey keep him down here
i 'm gonna put the cat back in the bag
what 'd you lace it with arsenic strychnine ?
you have your facts wrong detective
my brand is pure
i 'm a businessman
oh we 'r e gonna test it believe me
now get him outta my face
since that new UNknown came out but we 'r e on it boss
tomorrow 's press conference has been pushed to 1300 hours and then there 's the UNknown dedication at the police athletic league boxing gym
i imagine you 'r e wanting to wear the uniform for that
what about m cat ?
we 'r e waiting for lab results to come back
well they have
oh you know
hey it 's one beer with your brother all right ?
the old man always said to celebrate your victories
you saved a girl 's life
feel good about it
to the good guys
give me the less bad news
all right the od 's in queens UNknown heads
there 's no connection
it was a lethal dose of potassium chloride
i 'm not really a science geek
it 's a common chemical used in UNknown and and water UNknown
it 's not used in UNknown drugs
they also use it in death row inmates for lethal injections
my three months on the innocents project
that UNknown 's a real son of a bitch huh ?
it 's not UNknown
neither one had potassium chloride
UNknown didn 't put it in there who did ?
the only thing i 'm thinking is that maybe
billy wanted a bigger high and put it in there
maybe somebody else did looking to kill
if that 's true we UNknown e been coming at this all wrong
was it billy UNknown alyson you know one of the friends all four of UNknown m ?
the only person we can ask at this point is alyson UNknown
i 'm gonna go ask alyson now
cause she just got run down on riverside drive going out for a UNknown
you buy next time kid
she 's one lucky girl
she turned and saw it just in time
car clipped her took off
alyson detective reagan
you remember ?
i don 't know
something made me turn back and there was a car coming straight at me
did you see the driver ?
the headlights were in my eyes
how about the car ?
could you make out the model or make ?
it was medium sized uh dark color
it wasn 't an UNknown or anything
new york license plate ?
it all happened so fast
i think i did see a bumper sticker for my school though
i don 't know i could be imagining it
and from what you 'r e telling us now
looks like they tried to hurt you again
oh my god this can 't be happening
look is there anyone you can think of who may have wanted to do something like this to billy to you
caitlin hates me i know that
because of billy ?
you said she hates you
yeah well i 'm all over her hate book
hate book ?
some of the girls have them
they 'r e like UNknown of everyone they hate
i saw it once in UNknown class
there 's some really mean stuff
about billy too
her me and billy were in the same class
it 's hard to believe that caitlin UNknown is capable of murder
she can be difficult moody but
look at this
it 's not in anyone else 's
you know what it is ?
yeah i know
potassium turns violet when over heat
looks like somebody 's catholic school education paid off
by they way hate book
wait UNknown l you get a load of this
i wish that bitch was dead
her and billy both
read this yet dad ?
okay what about with alyson ?
she had billy and you wanted him
no i didn 't want billy anymore
i dumped him okay ?
that 's not what we heard
well all billy ever wanted to do was have sex and get high and it got worse
you two had sex ?
he said it would bring us closer
and i mean i 'm sorry but if you 'r e dating me you don 't need chemicals
and he even admitted to it but he wouldn 't tell me who it was
and i didn 't care anymore anyway
oh so he had a secret lover
all right so where were you between 6 00 and 7 00 last night ?
caitlin has UNknown on friday night
i went shopping in soho
you lied about that too ?
can you verify that ?
can anyone verify that ?
do you have any receipts from your little shopping trip ?
you can ask sara and rachel
they UNknown l tell you everywhere i went
or if you have an account you could go back and follow me yourself
you can follow her on UNknown
she told you to follow her on UNknown
look we got the hate book we got motive yeah
yeah her alibi from last night is very thin
all right we UNknown l check out her alibi
we UNknown l squeeze her friends
if her story doesn 't pan out then we nail her
how do you protect your kids from that ?
we learned about drugs in school mom
oh you knew about that huh ?
i 'm your father
i took UNknown m down to the tombs and locked UNknown m in
what 's the tombs ?
and you guys had all the fun
yeah dad did the same thing to me when i turned 11
he did ?
you know a lot of people think drugs should be made legal
yeah a lot of crazy people
yeah well that 's california
what do you expect ?
well it 's not legal here
and for good reason
i 'm just saying there 's no scientific proof that some drugs are more harmful than say alcohol
well there 's an argument to be made for UNknown
there 's a stupid argument for UNknown
you just watched three kids die
and you you know kids who knew these kids
if drugs were UNknown like alcohol and standards were quality controlled deciding who can sell it and to whom
and to whom ?
where do you get these theories ?
you sit around your dorm in college smoking pot with your buddies and you just come up with this crap ?
look at least UNknown would know what they 'r e getting ; UNknown and dealers would be out of business ; maybe these kids would be alive
we should be able to do what we want
it 's a free country
that 's a little UNknown honey
no it 's not
you think i don 't know that ?
you never take me seriously
i 'm sorry grandpa
she treats me like a child
oh you 'r e not mad at her because she changed her mind about letting you go into town
nobody else could go either after what happened at that party just
she never talks to me
i mean really talks
you know the other night when you were going to the gala she was crying the whole way over to your house and she wouldn 't tell me why
well maybe she 's trying to be strong for you right now
knowing how upset you are about the divorce
maybe your mom was thinking about her
just like you need your mom your mom needs you
to look out for her to understand her and love her
life isn 't fair
look at this
6 07 p m
so last year
and it 's at the exact same time that alyson UNknown was hit with the car miles away
assuming it was caitlin that was sending the UNknown
who ran down alyson ?
what about that secret lover caitlin was talking about ?
if she even exists
well whoever it was they tried to kill alyson UNknown twice so what do they say ?
third time 's the charm ?
let 's hope not
that 's worth a shot
well maybe it is
well you can tell the concerned parents we 'r e investigating a triple homicide at their children 's school
and also a hit and run on alyson UNknown
by examining cars ?
would you happen to know who may have a st angelus bumper sticker on their car ?
the way things are going i won 't be able to give them away
yeah it 's tough stuff father
well that 's just it
looks like somebody removed the bumper sticker here and ran this car through a wash
yeah like a hit and run trying to cover tracks
car 's registered to vice principal carol hoffman
what can you tell us about vice principal hoffman ?
the students love her
she ever have any UNknown issues with billy romero ?
not that i 'm aware of
any UNknown we should know about ?
well he can thank her for not UNknown out UNknown year
how so ?

yeah she was a chemistry teacher
before i promoted her

well actually uh we 'r e not looking for anything
we just wanted to ask you a few questions

an honest one

we always pushed boundaries back then
the kids today the boundaries they 'r e pushing though so much more dangerous

okay tell you what tell us where this came from we won 't kill you
come here and cuff this mutt
what for ?
you might have got away
you all right ?
this guy UNknown has got a major drug lab in the back
a lot of high end bicycles
hey keep him down here
i 'm gonna put the cat back in the bag
what 'd you lace it with arsenic strychnine ?
you have your facts wrong detective
my brand is pure
i 'm a businessman
oh we 'r e gonna test it believe me
now get him outta my face
since that new UNknown came out but we 'r e on it boss
tomorrow 's press conference has been pushed to 1300 hours and then there 's the UNknown dedication at the police athletic league boxing gym
i imagine you 'r e wanting to wear the uniform for that
what about m cat ?
we 'r e waiting for lab results to come back
well they have
oh you know
hey it 's one beer with your brother all right ?
the old man always said to celebrate your victories
you saved a girl 's life
feel good about it
to the good guys
give me the less bad news
all right the od 's in queens UNknown heads
there 's no connection
it was a lethal dose of potassium chloride
i 'm not really a science geek
it 's a common chemical used in UNknown and and water UNknown
it 's not used in UNknown drugs
they also use it in death row inmates for lethal injections
my three months on the innocents project
that UNknown 's a real son of a bitch huh ?
it 's not UNknown
neither one had potassium chloride
UNknown didn 't put it in there who did ?
the only thing i 'm thinking is that maybe
billy wanted a bigger high and put it in there
maybe somebody else did looking to kill
if that 's true we UNknown e been coming at this all wrong
was it billy UNknown alyson you know one of the friends all four of UNknown m ?
the only person we can ask at this point is alyson UNknown
i 'm gonna go ask alyson now
cause she just got run down on riverside drive going out for a UNknown
you buy next time kid
she 's one lucky girl
she turned and saw it just in time
car clipped her took off
alyson detective reagan
you remember ?
i don 't know
something made me turn back and there was a car coming straight at me
did you see the driver ?
the headlights were in my eyes
how about the car ?
could you make out the model or make ?
it was medium sized uh dark color
it wasn 't an UNknown or anything
new york license plate ?
it all happened so fast
i think i did see a bumper sticker for my school though
i don 't know i could be imagining it
and from what you 'r e telling us now
looks like they tried to hurt you again
oh my god this can 't be happening
look is there anyone you can think of who may have wanted to do something like this to billy to you
caitlin hates me i know that
because of billy ?
you said she hates you
yeah well i 'm all over her hate book
hate book ?
some of the girls have them
they 'r e like UNknown of everyone they hate
i saw it once in UNknown class
there 's some really mean stuff
about billy too
her me and billy were in the same class
it 's hard to believe that caitlin UNknown is capable of murder
she can be difficult moody but
look at this
it 's not in anyone else 's
you know what it is ?
yeah i know
potassium turns violet when over heat
looks like somebody 's catholic school education paid off
by they way hate book
wait UNknown l you get a load of this
i wish that bitch was dead
her and billy both
read this yet dad ?
okay what about with alyson ?
she had billy and you wanted him
no i didn 't want billy anymore
i dumped him okay ?
that 's not what we heard
well all billy ever wanted to do was have sex and get high and it got worse
you two had sex ?
he said it would bring us closer
and i mean i 'm sorry but if you 'r e dating me you don 't need chemicals
and he even admitted to it but he wouldn 't tell me who it was
and i didn 't care anymore anyway
oh so he had a secret lover
all right so where were you between 6 00 and 7 00 last night ?
caitlin has UNknown on friday night
i went shopping in soho
you lied about that too ?
can you verify that ?
can anyone verify that ?
do you have any receipts from your little shopping trip ?
you can ask sara and rachel
they UNknown l tell you everywhere i went
or if you have an account you could go back and follow me yourself
you can follow her on UNknown
she told you to follow her on UNknown
look we got the hate book we got motive yeah
yeah her alibi from last night is very thin
all right we UNknown l check out her alibi
we UNknown l squeeze her friends
if her story doesn 't pan out then we nail her
how do you protect your kids from that ?
we learned about drugs in school mom
oh you knew about that huh ?
i 'm your father
i took UNknown m down to the tombs and locked UNknown m in
what 's the tombs ?
and you guys had all the fun
yeah dad did the same thing to me when i turned 11
he did ?
you know a lot of people think drugs should be made legal
yeah a lot of crazy people
yeah well that 's california
what do you expect ?
well it 's not legal here
and for good reason
i 'm just saying there 's no scientific proof that some drugs are more harmful than say alcohol
well there 's an argument to be made for UNknown
there 's a stupid argument for UNknown
you just watched three kids die
and you you know kids who knew these kids
if drugs were UNknown like alcohol and standards were quality controlled deciding who can sell it and to whom
and to whom ?
where do you get these theories ?
you sit around your dorm in college smoking pot with your buddies and you just come up with this crap ?
look at least UNknown would know what they 'r e getting ; UNknown and dealers would be out of business ; maybe these kids would be alive
we should be able to do what we want
it 's a free country
that 's a little UNknown honey
no it 's not
you think i don 't know that ?
you never take me seriously
i 'm sorry grandpa
she treats me like a child
oh you 'r e not mad at her because she changed her mind about letting you go into town
nobody else could go either after what happened at that party just
she never talks to me
i mean really talks
you know the other night when you were going to the gala she was crying the whole way over to your house and she wouldn 't tell me why
well maybe she 's trying to be strong for you right now
knowing how upset you are about the divorce
maybe your mom was thinking about her
just like you need your mom your mom needs you
to look out for her to understand her and love her
life isn 't fair
look at this
6 07 p
so last year
and it 's at the exact same time that alyson UNknown was hit with the car miles away
assuming it was caitlin that was sending the UNknown
who ran down alyson ?
what about that secret lover caitlin was talking about ?
if she even exists
well whoever it was they tried to kill alyson UNknown twice so what do they say ?
third time 's the charm ?
let 's hope not
that 's worth a shot
well maybe it is
well you can tell the concerned parents we 'r e investigating a triple homicide at their children 's school
and also a hit and run on alyson UNknown
by examining cars ?
would you happen to know who may have a st angelus bumper sticker on their car ?
the way things are going i won 't be able to give them away
yeah it 's tough stuff father
well that 's just it
looks like somebody removed the bumper sticker here and ran this car through a wash
yeah like a hit and run trying to cover tracks
car 's registered to vice principal carol hoffman
what can you tell us about vice principal hoffman ?
the students love her
she ever have any UNknown issues with billy romero ?
not that i 'm aware of
any UNknown we should know about ?
well he can thank her for not UNknown out UNknown year
how so ?
she UNknown him in science ?
yeah she was a chemistry teacher
before i promoted her
we appreciate it
well actually uh we 'r e not looking for anything
we just wanted to ask you a few questions
why don 't you have a seat ?
i really should be getting back to my office
oh it won 't take long
so father leo says that uh you taught chemistry here
good student ?
he did some extra credit
ms hoffman you 'r e an intelligent woman
i think you know what we 'r e getting at with these questions
i 'm going to go get father leo
no no no
shut your mouth
you 'r e UNknown ?
he was so disgusted with himself that he had to take drugs just to have sex with you ?
is that it ?
i begged him
i told him he was making a big mistake
so if you couldn 't have him then no one could ?
he wouldn 't even look at me !
he wouldn 't talk to me
i didn 't think he 'd share it
to have somebody
i didn 't need to see him all the time just once in a while
let 's go
or am i just UNknown for a time that never existed ?
little bit of both i think
and human UNknown
heal the wounded bind up those who are bruised and reclaim the sinners
the UNknown motto above my door at st UNknown 's
easy to say
he 's agreed to let me hold a press conference
no more sweeping things under the rug
you may need divine intervention
the press will be more interested in creating heat than shedding light
if you UNknown l have me i would like to stand with you father
just as you UNknown e always been there for the UNknown
thank you francis
UNknown dumped an identity theft on my lap as i was trying to make my escape
i 'm sorry that i missed dinner

she 's trying to kick her habit so they won 't take him away
you expect me to watch him ?
it 's just for one night
look i 'm sorry
it 's okay
officer would you see her to her car please ?
the guys started a pool to see who could come up with the best joke
i think he 's our serial killer
got anything this time other than intuition ?
like evidence ?
his early childhood fits the profile
shy UNknown a UNknown
he was caught UNknown two blocks from the corner where sally worked
it 's the classic opportunity offender m o
they only kill when presented with the perfect victim at the perfect time
and if the opportunity is not perfect ?
it 's getting chilly
why is he travelling to one of the worst parts of town to jerk off in an alley ?
you okay ?
i didn 't know you were a cop
that was the idea
he introduced me to the guy who owns the club and that 's when i started you know
and you know he was getting me my medicine so i kind of felt like i owed him
i 'm UNknown
i knew it was wrong but he was such a sweet guy
he hit me in the head with a tire iron
yeah except for that
my aunt ?
she 's a nice lady
what fire ?
i give your aunt a lot of credit
it couldn 't have been easy raising a child under those circumstances
i owe her everything
i did the best i could
i 'd say
turned down a full ride to law school
who wants to be a lawyer right ?
i hear you
for a guy with such impressive brain power why install car UNknown for a living ?
do you like to hunt sean ?
do i like to hunt ?
how do you know about mike ?
talked to a detective back in UNknown
two boys go into the woods deer hunting
only one comes back alive
it was an accident
or maybe you just have a very active imagination
an intelligent but UNknown UNknown
i wonder how you give your imagination a workout
i know what you 'r e trying to get at
and frankly this whole UNknown thing it just seems a bit out of your league
just trying to get to know you better
he 's the guy
what are you doing getting tips ?
goddamn it !
he said he didn 't have to pay
that 's when he started hitting me
i took it and i shot him !
what 's she saying ?
you have to hit me
hit me !
no you don 't
about what ?
such as ?
he 's very effective seems to do fine with people and his relationship is he 's my boss
a very good one
more desk than street time
people resent that ?
i don 't know any family that doesn 't have the occasional disagreement
neither do i
am i ?
i don 't know
carl totally rolled on tulips
and tulips totally rolled on carl
he 's a svengali who got the dancers to go in on his little bait and bash game
carl says tulips organized it
she set up the UNknown
she 's a UNknown not amy fisher
bottom line who 's the ringleader ?
do i have to get involved ?
or nail both of them for kicking shane 's ass
i didn 't get my ass kicked
i got sucker punched
until UNknown UNknown the prom queen 's medical records i take pills get a blood test every 30 days
i 'm sorry
it happened so fast
if he 's UNknown
i screwed up though
well it 's just a bite you know ?
drug kit i 'm on i got no worries
that prick jumped you
what kind of message ?
you change your mind you let us know
what 's a blanket party ?
somebody likes to draw
he is ignored UNknown
maybe you 'd like to read my palms too
look at him
it 's why you became a cop
you thought by having a gun and badge they 'd respect you
that 's why you became a detective
tell me more
when you look in the mirror you don 't see the person you wish you were
just a lowly civil servant that you hoped you 'd never become
i hope you 'r e here to pick him up
i 'm bringing some things to connie
is that where you were all night ?
me and ronnie are helping her
she UNknown on her clothes
it 's ugly
i 'm sorry
i can 't
what the hell 's going on vic ?
what 'r e you talking about ?
i 'm not stupid
these UNknown UNknown were kicking the shit out of her for stealing johns
i gave her my number
i told her to call me if she needed help
six months pregnant screaming crying begging for forgiveness
i show up and find her in a pool of bloody UNknown
she tried to get rid of him with some UNknown and a UNknown handle
i rushed them to mission cross
they did an emergency c section
ten weeks premature
i have some old dresses in the garage
you don 't believe him do you ?
no of course not
so what can i do ?
is there anything that you can give me to prove carl 's guilt ?
i don 't know
victim 's names dates
there 's only one deal to be made here
and i 'd really like to see you get it
i want it
what 's to explain ?
why 'd you bite my partner ?
to give her what i got
you can 't pass UNknown through biting
aren 't you the expert ?
so you were trying to kill her ?
i got it in jail
cops put me in jail so why shouldn 't i give it to cops ?
look at you
wanna give me a big kiss lover ?
i should have bitten both of you
where is it you 'r e from again ?
and we get to monitor interrogation techniques
about three years
that 's right
that 's what people call the UNknown tactics in UNknown
isn 't it ?
i 'd say they 'r e more than nervous
the complaints suggest brutality
i need my detective
so she goes where it 's dirty ?
that 's not a new headline
no it 's not
this one cut your hands off and smiles as she asks you to clap louder
if she keeps digging no one is gonna be happy
i heard danny went home early
the medicine makes her UNknown
i hope she doesn 't end up like watson
no one mentioned him before
what do you expect ?
a cop gets shot in the line of duty and it 's all twenty one gun salutes
some queer in a dress gives you UNknown you end up unemployed and the city 's dirty secret
the guy who bit her couldn 't care less
just because danny doesn 't want to give him a blanket party doesn 't mean this fairy doesn 't deserve one
count me in
let 's go
roped in the other girls who were in on it
consider the UNknown book closed
hey i was doing a little channel UNknown up in observation
i didn 't know we got the spice network
you saw that
hey i talked to the UNknown
they all say the same thing
tulips was behind the whole thing
i 'm not too sure darling
see your dancer friends and carl they have a different hit on who 's calling the shots in your little scam
with their testimony two years is the best i can get for you
i 'm sorry
pardon me ?
enough dna to have you writing parking tickets in UNknown
so am i walking out of here or do we need to call your supervisor ?
do i look okay ?
would you like something to drink ?
let 's talk about you
now how does your father feel about the way that your life 's turned out ?
he 's proud of me
what 's up ?
it 's brutal
only it 's more UNknown
whatever you 'r e after put it on the table
we 'r e a UNknown force
bad guys don 't like to be arrested
UNknown are all they are
so you 'r e not promoting use of force to UNknown your impressive crime statistics
he gets results but not at the expense of the law
he deserves a lot of credit
what about your alleged rape of a 21 year old white girl ?
vic give us a minute
what are you doing ?
a captain with a history of violence commands the district with the highest percentage of brutality complaints
now he wants to be on the city council
that was 15 years ago
hospital records show maureen UNknown had signs of UNknown and burns
i 'm not gonna discuss this
i have a wife and daughter
how would you feel if their UNknown wanted to be their representative ?
there 's not a story here
i UNknown l take that as a no comment
truth is i may not have been a popular guy in school but i got laid
more than a few times
i 'm getting laid now too
and guess what ?
sherlock holmes is getting smoked
truth is i just like to solve puzzles
i would UNknown e told you earlier but i needed time to do a few things
now here 's what i know about you
you 'r e UNknown
you have access to other people 's cars
that way they can 't be traced back to you
because in your business you can 't make any mistakes
did you put a UNknown UNknown player into a green ford taurus five weeks ago ?
i don 't know
customer said you returned it with a broken UNknown
now that does sound vaguely familiar there
you remember sally sean ?
should i dutch ?
instead you decided to stick around and show off
the judge issued a search warrant
for what ?
you 'r e not gonna find anything there
just the standard collection of bondage domination porn
which is why we also got a search warrant for you aunt 's house
you can 't do that
you UNknown the mortgage
this is your aunt 's house
this is the porch

how many more are we gonna find sean ?
the other ones i dumped
i ran out of room under my aunt 's house
it 's pathetic
i killed 22 people
oh i 'm special all right
if you 'r e so special how come a lowly civil servant like me just caught you ?
yes you did
it 's right over here
way to go ron jeremy
simple investigation and you cage everyone except the evil stripper
we got the guy who hit me
and she 's a dancer
so everyone else here is free to bang away
lem here is UNknown chiquita banana

she 's trying to kick her habit so they won 't take him away
you expect me to watch him ?
it 's just for one night
look i 'm sorry
it 's okay
officer would you see her to her car please ?
the guys started a pool to see who could come up with the best joke
i think he 's our serial killer
got anything this time other than intuition ?
like evidence ?
his early childhood fits the profile
shy UNknown a UNknown
he was caught UNknown two blocks from the corner where sally worked
it 's the classic opportunity offender m o
they only kill when presented with the perfect victim at the perfect time
and if the opportunity is not perfect ?
it 's getting chilly
why is he travelling to one of the worst parts of town to jerk off in an alley ?
you okay ?
i didn 't know you were a cop
that was the idea
he introduced me to the guy who owns the club and that 's when i started you know
and you know he was getting me my medicine so i kind of felt like i owed him
i 'm UNknown
i knew it was wrong but he was such a sweet guy
he hit me in the head with a tire iron
yeah except for that
my aunt ?
she 's a nice lady
what fire ?
i give your aunt a lot of credit
it couldn 't have been easy raising a child under those circumstances
i owe her everything
i did the best i could
i 'd say
turned down a full ride to law school
who wants to be a lawyer right ?
i hear you
for a guy with such impressive brain power why install car UNknown for a living ?
do you like to hunt sean ?
do i like to hunt ?
how do you know about mike ?
talked to a detective back in UNknown
two boys go into the woods deer hunting
only one comes back alive
it was an accident
or maybe you just have a very active imagination
an intelligent but UNknown UNknown
i wonder how you give your imagination a workout
i know what you 'r e trying to get at
and frankly this whole UNknown thing it just seems a bit out of your league
just trying to get to know you better
he 's the guy
what are you doing getting tips ?
goddamn it !
he said he didn 't have to pay
that 's when he started hitting me
i took it and i shot him !
what 's she saying ?
you have to hit me
hit me !
no you don 't
about what ?
such as ?
he 's very effective seems to do fine with people and his relationship is he 's my boss
a very good one
more desk than street time
people resent that ?
i don 't know any family that doesn 't have the occasional disagreement
neither do i
am i ?
i don 't know
carl totally rolled on tulips
and tulips totally rolled on carl
he 's a svengali who got the dancers to go in on his little bait and bash game
carl says tulips organized it
she set up the UNknown
she 's a UNknown not amy fisher
bottom line who 's the ringleader ?
do i have to get involved ?
or nail both of them for kicking shane 's ass
i didn 't get my ass kicked
i got sucker punched
until UNknown UNknown the prom queen 's medical records i take pills get a blood test every 30 days
i 'm sorry
it happened so fast
if he 's UNknown
i screwed up though
well it 's just a bite you know ?
drug kit i 'm on i got no worries
that prick jumped you
what kind of message ?
you change your mind you let us know
what 's a blanket party ?
somebody likes to draw
he is ignored UNknown
maybe you 'd like to read my palms too
look at him
it 's why you became a cop
you thought by having a gun and badge they 'd respect you
that 's why you became a detective
tell me more
when you look in the mirror you don 't see the person you wish you were
just a lowly civil servant that you hoped you 'd never become
i hope you 'r e here to pick him up
i 'm bringing some things to connie
is that where you were all night ?
me and ronnie are helping her
she UNknown on her clothes
it 's ugly
i 'm sorry
i can 't
what the hell 's going on vic ?
what 'r e you talking about ?
i 'm not stupid
these UNknown UNknown were kicking the shit out of her for stealing johns
i gave her my number
i told her to call me if she needed help
six months pregnant screaming crying begging for forgiveness
i show up and find her in a pool of bloody UNknown
she tried to get rid of him with some UNknown and a UNknown handle
i rushed them to mission cross
they did an emergency c section
ten weeks premature
i have some old dresses in the garage
you don 't believe him do you ?
no of course not
so what can i do ?
is there anything that you can give me to prove carl 's guilt ?
i don 't know
victim 's names dates
there 's only one deal to be made here
and i 'd really like to see you get it
i want it
what 's to explain ?
why 'd you bite my partner ?
to give her what i got
you can 't pass UNknown through biting
aren 't you the expert ?
so you were trying to kill her ?
i got it in jail
cops put me in jail so why shouldn 't i give it to cops ?
look at you
wanna give me a big kiss lover ?
i should have bitten both of you
where is it you 'r e from again ?
and we get to monitor interrogation techniques
about three years
that 's right
that 's what people call the UNknown tactics in UNknown
isn 't it ?
i 'd say they 'r e more than nervous
the complaints suggest brutality
i need my detective
so she goes where it 's dirty ?
that 's not a new headline
no it 's not
this one cut your hands off and smiles as she asks you to clap louder
if she keeps digging no one is gonna be happy
i heard danny went home early
the medicine makes her UNknown
i hope she doesn 't end up like watson
no one mentioned him before
what do you expect ?
a cop gets shot in the line of duty and it 's all twenty one gun salutes
some queer in a dress gives you UNknown you end up unemployed and the city 's dirty secret
the guy who bit her couldn 't care less
just because danny doesn 't want to give him a blanket party doesn 't mean this fairy doesn 't deserve one
count me in
let 's go
roped in the other girls who were in on it
consider the UNknown book closed
hey i was doing a little channel UNknown up in observation
i didn 't know we got the spice network
you saw that
hey i talked to the UNknown
they all say the same thing
tulips was behind the whole thing
i 'm not too sure darling
see your dancer friends and carl they have a different hit on who 's calling the shots in your little scam
with their testimony two years is the best i can get for you
i 'm sorry
pardon me ?
enough dna to have you writing parking tickets in UNknown
so am i walking out of here or do we need to call your supervisor ?
do i look okay ?
would you like something to drink ?
let 's talk about you
now how does your father feel about the way that your life 's turned out ?
he 's proud of me
what 's up ?
it 's brutal
only it 's more UNknown
whatever you 'r e after put it on the table
we 'r e a UNknown force
bad guys don 't like to be arrested
UNknown are all they are
so you 'r e not promoting use of force to UNknown your impressive crime statistics
he gets results but not at the expense of the law
he deserves a lot of credit
what about your alleged rape of a 21 year old white girl ?
vic give us a minute
what are you doing ?
a captain with a history of violence commands the district with the highest percentage of brutality complaints
now he wants to be on the city council
that was 15 years ago
hospital records show maureen UNknown had signs of UNknown and burns
i 'm not gonna discuss this
i have a wife and daughter
how would you feel if their UNknown wanted to be their representative ?
there 's not a story here
i UNknown l take that as a no comment
truth is i may not have been a popular guy in school but i got laid
more than a few times
i 'm getting laid now too
and guess what ?
sherlock holmes is getting smoked
truth is i just UNknown e to solve puzzles
i would UNknown e told you earlier but i needed time to do a few things
now here 's what i know about you
you 'r e UNknown
you have access to other people 's cars
that way they can 't be traced back to you
because in your business you can 't make any mistakes
did you put a UNknown UNknown player into a green ford taurus five weeks ago ?
i don 't know
customer said you returned it with a broken UNknown
now that does sound vaguely familiar there
you remember sally sean ?
should i dutch ?
instead you decided to stick around and show off
the judge issued a search warrant
for what ?
you 'r e not gonna find anything there
just the standard collection of bondage domination porn
which is why we also got a search warrant for you aunt 's house
you can 't do that
you UNknown the mortgage
this is your aunt 's house
this is the porch
just dug two bodies out of
how many more are we gonna find sean ?
the other ones i dumped
i ran out of room under my aunt 's house
it 's pathetic
i killed 22 people
oh i 'm special all right
if you 'r e so special how come a lowly civil servant like me just caught you ?
yes you did
it 's right over here
way to go ron jeremy
simple investigation and you cage everyone except the evil stripper
we got the guy who hit me
and she 's a dancer
so everyone else here is free to bang away
lem here is UNknown chiquita banana
i 'm tired of you saying it
oh so once again i 'm the asshole
just leave UNknown out of this all right ?
i dig her
i don 't wanna keep anything from you
who is this woman ?
maureen was a girlfriend at UNknown
her father is chester UNknown
the publisher ?
pleasure pain kind of thing
i couldn 't
she grabbed my roommate 's UNknown
i didn 't get this scar rock climbing
what kind of charges ?
my god david

babe you just say the word and i will step away from all of this
let the bitch come after you

you need help
someone will love him
he needs his mother
there you go

previously on the shield
it took you over an hour to show up
where 's the police ?
where are you ?
i know you 'r e angry
this is a serious problem
wouldn 't be no problem in beverly hills
i was in a hit and run tonight
that 's his buddy
yeah if i keep quiet
you call me anytime
nothing you haven 't done
when were you gonna tell me you 'r e UNknown a UNknown ?
i didn 't wanna get her involved
who is she ?
its sole purpose ?
you UNknown e been UNknown police resources to crash land value ?
your mistress has been buying up property in this area like disney
she never checked into the bungalow
another lie ?
or slashed her
but ben 's already here
UNknown 's there ?
you should UNknown e left UNknown out of it
pack bags for you and the kids
you 'r e not staying here
the men are coming under increased attack
it 's time to pull back or turn them loose
i wish i knew
one tango 13 respond
hey wait a minute
you might need backup
keep them comfortable and calm
you got it
they 'r e not
i have to find out a few things
i wanna go home
what are you mixed up in ?
this doesn 't happen to other cops families
what are you doing that 's worth making us go into hiding ?
i just need the four of you to stay here
all right ?
we 'd still be at the park if you had
guess we UNknown l never know
hey was that a false alarm or what ?
oh my god !
up there !
when the units responded they opened fire
danny and julien were there
they 'r e okay
yeah looks like it
get in line
who 's it registered to ?
hey hey hold up
i don 't know
your cell was used to lure them there
i say i lost my cell
why don 't you tell us for the third time you got no idea how ?
don 't get all surly with me
ain 't a crime to lose your cell phone
you kept insisting it 's a waste of time
maybe i was wrong
UNknown UNknown used to work in accounting for the department
what our department ?
did you cut through the paper trail ?
all the land UNknown went through the same UNknown company
did you talk to them ?
without a warrant they won 't let me
how about letting me take a shot at it ?
UNknown 's not at home or his office
the guy 's a goddamn ghost
he 's gotta be somewhere
who knows where he UNknown l be next ?
your house again ?
maybe he 's hiding with the mistress
oh come on
he threatened your family
will you stop making threats and start helping me find the guy ?
now dig in
if UNknown 's gonna cash in on these deals he needs the girl 's signature
when we find this UNknown we find him
though i walk through the midst of trouble your hand will revive me
you will stretch out
i almost lost my partner last night
i 'm just thankful
excuse me ?
you UNknown e either had a phone lost or UNknown by each and every one of them
always on the first of the month
you wait a few days report it missing
meanwhile half of union station is calling up UNknown
wait a minute man
i wouldn 't get mixed up in no cop killings or nothing like that
i mean you guys are the real heroes out there right ?
stop kissing ass and give us a name
his name is UNknown
those jews ?
he 's a real jew from jerusalem or something
there 's been another 911 shooting
they 'r e both dead
you see that ?
wanna try the smoke out ?
what report ?
she didn 't see the crime but she did see another witness
she 's gonna be here in a few minutes to identify you so you may as well come forward right now
you stop !
i didn 't do nothing man
you can 't do that
come on !
you just gotta get that rock off me
the whole truth first
now can you take the dope with you ?
our artist just finished
someone 's gotta know these guys
no one talks to the press but me
i want every off duty officer scrambled and in this building within 45 minutes
UNknown why are you sitting there ?
i 'm working a hit and run
half the district 's on fire
there 's no other case
you and UNknown will run the investigation
i was handling this personally
you had command of the riot squad and a lady got trampled to death
the UNknown last night i stayed out of it and now i got two more dead
i can 't afford your leadership now
we 'r e making progress
but do it downstairs because i 'm taking over your office
pete i need the case file duty roster and a cup of coffee not too much cream
pete could you wait for a minute outside please ?
stay close in case i need you though
what do you want vic ?
you threatened my family
you kept digging into UNknown and our land deals
i was just UNknown you
you know what you did
you know what i 'm gonna have to do
you 'r e not doing anything
trust me i got something on you
call me friend ?
do what you do best
find these cop killers
i wanna get some of the UNknown boys here until we catch these UNknown
that 's all for now
UNknown 's really got you spinning huh ?
i mean blame this whole mess on you and then yank you off it
we get these guys he 's the hero
either way you 'r e the goat
guess you can kiss that city council seat goodbye
you here to pile on ?
what if i told you there was a way to flip things around make you the hero ?
maybe even put your political career on track
UNknown diverted police units from that part of town so crime would rise and he could buy property at a discount ?
led to the murder of those two women the riots the cop UNknown
when he killed that kid in the hit and run with his mistress he was afraid it 'd get out
if that 's true why don 't you go upstairs and arrest him ?
because i can 't prove it
this land deal is a paper trail nightmare
i can 't begin to crack it
your UNknown you could
it 's not
he had the car fixed
and one of the witnesses was already killed in a gang hit
what about the woman in the car ?
find her she can give him up for the land deal and the hit and run
find her yourself
and why should i do all your UNknown ?
because when i find these cop shooters l UNknown l let you bring them in
that way you get the credit for taking down UNknown and them
sounds like a nice headline to me
a little too nice
i don 't expect you to trust me
but i know you 'r e too curious not to check in on it
trying to put at t out of business UNknown ?
each and every one of these phones is either stolen or UNknown
i am as shocked as you are to discover that
i don 't know
they killed three police officers and put the fourth in a hospital
give us the numbers of the phones
of course of course
i 'm giving a reward to whoever id 's these three
how 'r e my kids ?
i don 't know
day or two ?
i got things coming at me from every direction
i don 't need more problems
what 's happening to this family is the problem and you won 't tell me why
just do nothing
just sit there and do nothing
is that so hard ?
i 'm not your prisoner
look i UNknown l tell you when it 's safe
don 't bother
people 's nerves are shot
they need an escape
killing cops ain 't
a lot of people think the cops had it coming
i say we need to work with the police
i 'm glad you feel that way
i need a line on these guys
i hear anything
something happens you UNknown l be my feet and hands too
you UNknown l have to get off your corner and get involved
UNknown sometimes brag about this
they do we need to know
i UNknown l get involved see who 's talking
you do that
well who can release that information ?
you got a minute david ?
nerves get a bit raw at a time like this
yes they do
but until recently i figured he meant well
now i 'm not so sure
what are you talking about ?
there was a dead kid the other day
i UNknown e got a source though says it was mackey
and he has a lot of friends who don 't wanna see him hang
you 'r e the only one i can trust with this

i UNknown e done well lately
thanks to your corporation in the UNknown
that 's quite the shell game
if you were going to arrest me you would UNknown e taken me in
not back to my place
sure you don 't want a drink ?
how does it work this land scheme of yours ?
i speculate real estate
unless your boyfriend keeps police resources from there so it stays a slum so you could buy it cheap
wow i should UNknown e thought of that
i 'm sure you did
seems a bit complicated for UNknown
i don 't know a UNknown
you worked in his office for two months
i bet you showed him how to park pension funds into your account to make your purchases
now let 's talk about your boyfriend 's hit and run
i understand your anger
your father 's a heroin addict your mother left when you were 9
am i missing any of the broad strokes ?
the two women who were murdered across the street from you
did you know them ?
saw them sometimes
UNknown knew the women good
they looked after her
the police didn 't kill those women
wally UNknown did
so you kill three people ?
i don 't care how right you think you are
i don 't care what kind of bad life you had
what you did was wrong
it 's as wrong as it gets
vic this is UNknown UNknown
i UNknown e been looking for you
i UNknown e been right here
she has a lot of interesting things to say about our assistant chief
so much for loyalty huh lady ?
ben 's in love
you didn 't think i 'd find out about the murder ?
what murder ?
that was a gang hit
are you in a gang now ?
what is she saying i killed jesus ?
she says a cop buddy cleaned it all up for UNknown
i wonder who that is
you 'r e both filthy in this
hey i had nothing to do with killing that UNknown kid
so if i checked out your place i wouldn 't find the murder weapon
no way in hell
UNknown thinks we UNknown l find something
i thought he was there
he must UNknown e planted the gun there
and why would UNknown have a murder weapon to an unsolved gang hit ?
because he killed jesus
i was in the room when he did it
i found him
and we all know how squeaky clean you are
UNknown had you get this warrant ?
that 's right
you haven 't searched my house ?
i talked UNknown into letting you catch these cop killers first
and then we 'r e moving on you
now are you gonna help UNknown frame me ?
or are you gonna go with me and nail these bastards ?
you sure the shooter 's inside ?
UNknown did the trick
said the guy told them to get lost waved a gun around
all right ladies
if not they killed rudy patrick and chris
i ain 't about the romance i 'm all about the finance
now put your hands on your head !
get down !
i 'm not gonna tell you again !
everyone all right ?
he caught three cop killers cleaned up your mess and you can just stab him in the back
my mess ?
mackey 's just covering his ass
the land schemes ?
you gonna try laying those at his door too ?
don 't come near this david
especially without any proof
get out of my office
if you won 't serve this i UNknown l find someone who will
you 'r e fired

i 'm not like you

i 'm always trying to get you to open up but you never pry
why is that ?
your family 's gone man
two of the shooters have been detained the other is dead
captain can you comment on the arrest of assistant chief ben UNknown ?
the facts will show that assistant chief UNknown chose a path that led to tragic circumstances for the city
i know you UNknown l wanna find us but if you still have love for me you won 't try for a while anyway
i 'm sorry

in my experience people hate being told who to vote for
i wouldn 't declare me the winner quite yet
i UNknown e enjoyed my UNknown status up to now
let 's focus on what today 's events really mean
three officers gave their lives in defence of an institution that their boss betrayed for personal gain
it 's a scandal and an outrage
the curse of corruption has left its mark on this department
now we start the difficult task of healing

now my wife can come
she 's already here

he never harmed in the wide world 's span
a soul by deceit or UNknown ;
his eyes though sometimes would blaze and fret
most when the storm was nigh
and now all i UNknown e heard about UNknown i UNknown l try
to tell from the first to last
with land UNknown he was never at ease ;
no better by far then to dwell on the seas
on the mighty UNknown and the flow
in autumn when wild geese were singing south
he met with their flying UNknown
a UNknown fell on the sailor 's breast ;
life lay astern with fire and zest and ahead lay a winter 's gloom
they anchored and off his UNknown went
with leave for a wild UNknown
he watched them with envy and UNknown
while he stood by his silent house
indoors there were two bestowed ;
his wife sat and span in the peaceful light
but the crib held a rosy healthy mite
a baby girl and it UNknown
that instant and UNknown 's mind men say turned sober upon the spot
he would sing all his happiest UNknown there
where little anna UNknown his brown hair
and lay in his folding arm
life UNknown along till the year of war
in eighteen hundred and nine
the tale 's still told of what people bore
where want and distress combine
cruisers from england UNknown each port
by land there was UNknown far and wide ;

two powerful arms were no longer support
with death and disease outside
then UNknown UNknown for a day or two
but his miseries quickly go ;
he thought of a comrade ancient and true
the sea 's great UNknown and its flow
the smallest dory there was to hand he chose for his UNknown trip
sail and mast he left home on land such gear he thought best not ship
when winds stopped UNknown quite so wild
UNknown UNknown UNknown for his wife and child
crossed the sea in an open boat !
the UNknown reef was the devil to clear
but worse he 'd the english blockade to fear
its look out 's eagle eyed gleam
to be continued
he gathered his precious stores
here was the staff of life to hand ;
and his wife and baby call
the fourth morning at dawn by sun 's first rays
a blurred misty line to scan
near home at last ;
that instant the word froze on his lip ;
g sling 's the UNknown with hidden top just east of the UNknown sound ;
the english officer shouted stop !
he UNknown an UNknown let it drop and stove in the dory 's shell
there on the innermost beach ashore watches my wife at our pitiful door
and waits with our baby for bread !
he dived and he swam and he dived yet again ;
in two feet depth all that treasure sank
they lifted him out and over the side
he offered his sorrow they sold him their UNknown
then UNknown fell silent all hope was past
he locked up his grief in his soul
he UNknown in prison for many a day
for all of five years say some
his shoulders rounded his hair it turned grey
from dreaming about his home
then eighteen fourteen came and with it accord ;
a swedish UNknown brought home onboard
norway 's prisoners and UNknown too
back at the jetty he came ashore a pilot by king 's decree ;
but few recalled in the UNknown they saw
the youngster who UNknown the sea
his house was a stranger 's ;
and how they UNknown those two inside he soon found
the husband UNknown them and nobody cared
they came to the plot that the UNknown shared
in the parish burial ground
to be continued
as pilot out there on the isle
his eyes though sometimes would blaze and fret
when the reef to the breakers ran high
and then people sensed he was troubled yet
and then there were few who felt no threat
with UNknown UNknown by
there was a stir where the pilots sit
an english yacht being carried in with UNknown torn and UNknown split
close reached to the weather a cutter UNknown
like a hero he seized on the wheel ;
preserve us alive from the breakers roar
i UNknown l make you as wealthy as wretched before
the pilot let go of the craft
his cheeks they went white and his mouth shaped a sound
like a smile that at last can break free
the yacht was UNknown and ran squarely aground
his lordship 's queen of the sea
abandon the ship !
my lord and my lady stay near !
to UNknown he UNknown at g UNknown 's top
and to UNknown at UNknown swell
he let go helm and the UNknown UNknown
he UNknown an UNknown and let it drop
and stove in the cutter 's shell !
anna my child ! she cried out in dread
to be continued
UNknown of the arc of rough seas
there 's no cause for grief !
a sunken dory supplies our relief three UNknown casks our dock
he knew now the sailor that on his knee
had UNknown on his deck and wept !
you sailed at ease in your mighty UNknown
i UNknown in my humble boat
i UNknown for my own in my forehead 's sweat
you robbed them of bread and could mock me yet
and over my salt tears gloat
it 's time for my vengeance to strike beware !
stand back there my lord !
one step if you dare
and your wife and child is the price !
but UNknown 's forehead showed peaceful and fair
and now UNknown UNknown 's himself again
like a rocky stream flowed my blood till then ;
for i had to i had to repay !
the years i spent in the prison 's roar
they bred my heart 's UNknown
but now it 's over ; we two are even
when daylight had broken then all was well ;
long lay the yacht in port
one day milord and lady came by
no rescue came in the nick out there
from this little mite by me
the yacht then headed for UNknown sound
with norway 's own flag for wear
he lay to the sun and the winds keen weight
and that 's why the grass was so stubborn straight
but with wild field flowers between
UNknown UNknown by henrik UNknown
he never harmed in the wide world 's span a soul by deceit or UNknown ;
his eyes though sometimes would blaze and fret most when a storm was nigh
and now all i UNknown e heard about UNknown i UNknown l try to tell from the first to last
with land UNknown he was never at ease ; no better by far then to dwell on the seas on the mighty UNknown and the flow
in autumn when wild geese were singing south he met with their flying UNknown
a UNknown fell on the sailor 's breast ;
life lay astern with fire and zest and ahead lay a winter 's gloom
they anchored and off his UNknown went with leave for a wild UNknown
he watched them with envy and UNknown while he stood by his silent house
indoors there were two bestowed
his wife sat and span in the peaceful light but the crib held a rosy healthy mite a baby girl and it UNknown
that instant and UNknown 's mind men say turned sober upon the spot
he would sing all his happiest UNknown there where little anna UNknown his brown hair and lay in his folding arm
life UNknown along till the year of war in eighteen hundred and nine
the tale 's still told of what people bore where want and distress combine
cruisers from england UNknown each port by land there was UNknown far and wide ;
the poor people starved the wealthy went short
two powerful arms were no longer support with death and disease outside
then UNknown UNknown for a day or two
but his miseries quickly go ;
he thought of a comrade ancient and true the sea 's great UNknown and its flow

he UNknown an oar butt and let it drop and stove in the dory 's shell

well the more the better
i wish every UNknown in washington could see this place
deborah they 'r e here already
lord knows when the congressional committee will arrive
i don 't blame them for being early
you and i know what this means to them uncle
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
they haven 't left fort scott yet
well let me know
let them smoke if they UNknown e got anything to smoke which i doubt
at ease !
good morning friend thomas
that 's pretty stylish for a quaker
i made it just for this great day
it 's mighty pretty
well you can 't expect speed from UNknown but they ought to be here any minute now
well i 'd offer to help you but i can see you don 't need it
oh don 't i now ?
well the leg on the senator 's chair seems to be stuck
senator huh ?
there we are
i think i UNknown l put him at the head of the table
he 'd like that
let us know when those gentlemen from the east arrive
i don 't know sir
you don 't know sir
just came in from fort reno sir
i UNknown l be damned !
congressional committee delayed by bumpy roads and dust storms
decided to return to reno in order to rest up for the officers ball tonight
you mean they 'r e not coming here at all ?
how long do they expect me to wait to build some barracks out here ?
archer i 'm going to fort reno see to it
friend major please will you tell them about the medicine and the food the indians need ?
and all the things that were promised ?
uncle you must make him listen
how can i ?
you UNknown e been here from the beginning
you UNknown e watched them die of smallpox and measles and malaria
you UNknown e watched them starve
haven 't you anything to say ?
nothing that you can 't say better
major braden !
i 'm asking you to make them realize that over a thousand cheyenne were brought here and only 286 are left alive
miss wright my responsibility to the indians is only to guard them
when you have reached my age you will have realized that it pays to stick to your own knitting
that 's exactly what i intend to do
dull knife !
the indian bureau is still pledged to provide you with adequate clothing and rations
you are still pledged to abide by the law
the white man remembers nothing
you spoke the truth for us
this we will not forget
but there will be no more school
the white man 's words are lies !
it is better that our children not learn them
it is not the words but who speaks them
has speaking white men 's words made you a liar ?
our words were learned long ago
when some white men still spoke truth
you 'r e gonna be pretty lonesome friend school teacher
friend thomas you know i came here to carry out a task
i can 't leave now
UNknown in this schoolhouse won 't help
it will show them that i 'm on their side
not unless you can change color
you know what they call whites ?
and means spider !
and why shouldn 't they ?
how many UNknown have you fought ?
how many have you killed ?
deborah look will you take the UNknown off just for once ?
you claim no self respecting quaker could fall in love with a soldier but you UNknown e fallen in love with a whole tribe of them
have you ever seen a cheyenne ?
of course i have
all you UNknown e seen is reservation indians looking pitiful as fish out of water
but give them a chance they 'r e the greatest fighters in the world
will you listen to me ?
it takes a blue coat to make a white man a soldier
but a cheyenne is a soldier from the first slap on his bottom
war is his life
and he 's meaner than sin
possibly you can only think of the past but i 'm here to think about the future
want some help ?
and if anything happens ring the bell
spanish woman where are they going ?
what about the children ?
they are cheyenne
we will do what we can
they are cheyenne
he UNknown l never make such a trip
there will be no more dying in this place
they UNknown e skipped
i UNknown e waited since i was 10 years old for this chance
then you 'r e a damned idiot
i want d troop ready and mounted in 10 minutes
e troop and wagons to follow under your command
you brought the wagons along too fast mr scott
draft animals can 't stand it
they can rest up tonight
they can ?
we 'r e gonna keep moving
that 's fine with me sir
scott tell me something
it 's just a private matter sir
nothing that affects an officer 's conduct is private
my father died in the UNknown massacre back in UNknown 6
mother and i were at the fort when they brought his body in
i was only 10 years old
until that time i never wanted to be a soldier
well that doesn 't give you a personal license to kill indians
the job of this army is to keep the peace
i understand sir
and they won 't unless they cross the river
so if you provoke trouble l UNknown l see that you lose those shoulder straps if i have to tear them off myself
they haven 't jumped the reservation
they haven 't crossed the river yet
sir i most respectfully object to
put it in writing
i think war
he UNknown l listen to you
i can do nothing
troop halt !
take a look up that canyon
go on !
on ride into line !
on ride into line !
cannon forward on the double !
prepare to dismount !
all soldiers to the rear !
go back to your troop the majority of those people are women and children !
maybe 50 or 60 warriors
archer you 'r e under arrest
number one gun fire !
number two gun fire !
fire number one
is he ?
does it ever matter who fires the first shot ?
those dirty murdering
pick up the horses
shut up !
UNknown brown get the horses off the wagons
my son says the soldiers do not follow
dull knife you know the soldiers will have to follow us
have you thought what will happen to your wife and son ?
there will be war
but i want them to be born where i and all my people before me were born
even a dog can go where he likes but not a cheyenne
you may go where you like
bloodthirsty savages on the loose
burning killing violating beautiful white women !
it 's not news anymore
we 'r e gonna take a different tack
from now on we 'r e going to grieve for the noble red man
we UNknown l sell more paper that way
now see to it !
we assure you there 's nothing personal about our proposed UNknown
the entire senate has the greatest respect for you you know that
but all i know is that you 'r e trying to snatch the indian bureau away from my department and hand it over to the army
mr senator ?
an UNknown ?
what are driving at sir ?
well just this
well it 's strictly a matter of economy
the army has to be out there anyway
oh so that 's all it is
i was afraid perhaps that some of the dollar patriots who are sleeping on my doorstep might have been sleeping on yours
sir are you questioning our honesty of purpose ?
no more than i question theirs
their honest purpose is to grab every acre of land the indians once thought they owned
you can 't say that 's army policy
well i can say it amounts to the same thing
the smaller the reservations the easier they are to guard
you let the army have its way and they UNknown l end up the size of postage stamps
exactly what the land UNknown want
we UNknown l be late for that committee meeting
excuse us mr secretary
all you ever knew is that they were human beings with the rights of human beings
and it was worth an arm to you
carl i UNknown l stall this UNknown but unless those cheyenne are found soon or if you make one false move god help you
god help me
this i say
never has the UNknown of a straw come between us
we still think as one
as war chief i may raise my hand only against the enemy
we still think as one
that is why i must sleep with no wife saving all my strength for a fight against the soldiers
but your son tries to steal my youngest wife
this cannot be
and my blood has never been bad
he is of your blood but he is not you
troop halt !
here 's what i want
their backs are to the wall !
and a lot of flat land to cross before we get there
i 'd rather force them to attack us
well they ain 't done nothing foolish yet
then you move out with the rest to cover the right flank
any questions ?
take the point
hurry up there
forward at the walk
as you were
they 'r e at the wagons
get the guns
let 's go
i 'm sorry sir
and i sure would like to kill me an injun
can 't you gut eaters talk any UNknown ?
i dare you homer
all them old timers back home a UNknown about how many scalps they UNknown e took
jessie that 's one of them there one of them there cheyenne
we better UNknown and get that herd out of here
let 's go
g o o d good
g o o good
let go of my colt !
my colt my colt !
soon she will see one again
before the cold
bellies will be full and no longer will we be alone
our friends the dakota ?
always it is so
very very soon
UNknown attack settlers and massacre them !
cards gentlemen if you please
oh was that an ace ?
i 'm blind as a bat
now marshal you can see right through to my ace in the hole
what 's your ace worth major ?
sure over in the corner playing poker
excuse me mayor
you bet 25 bucks ?
dr holliday ?
don 't do that
you thought this was the prettiest dress you ever saw
why you couldn 't take your eyes off it
now i 'm ace high
doc what do you do ?
madam ? !
what kind of a marshal are you ?
i UNknown l call
well as i understand it a mademoiselle is a madam who ain 't quite made it yet only younger and UNknown
i 'd call it a compliment
you 'r e out huh ?
oh you would would you ?
our brave marshal !
yeah the only trouble is she thinks she knew me back in wichita and i just plain can 't remember
that makes for a very embarrassing situation
all right the deuces bet bet the whole lot
oh about a corporal 's squad
a corporal 's squad ?
oh don 't worry mayor we UNknown l cut them indians down to our size
why you can 't leave this town unprotected like this
well listen i tell you i 'm gonna have your command
we UNknown l see you when we get back
i tell you i 'm gonna write to washington
and when they get my letter you can 't leave a town like this unprotected
aren 't horses in here a bit unusual ?
what horses ?
bottle of UNknown there
you rushing for a train ?
plenty and then some
all but a corporal 's guard has gone west to fight the cheyenne
but we showed them how the cow eats the cabbage didn 't we boys ?
if you don 't believe it take a look at that
after they killed poor pete we was like the lord and his avenging sword
injuns huh ?
wyatt you gotta listen to me !
quiet down there
something about indians
that 'd look real nice
give this place some tone
don 't look at me
i sometimes decorate cards
well just listen to this
several UNknown murdered
UNknown trains robbed
that is light
are you claiming you can judge the weight of one single card ?
let me see them
now you all know that we depend upon them texans coming up here with wages in their pockets
they haven 't been coming up as much as they UNknown e been
and if this kind of stuff keeps up they won 't be coming at all
bless my soul
every citizen of dodge stands ready to go out
gentlemen i swear i didn 't palm it
major where is the card ?
a new deck
now did you ever in your whole life read anything true in that paper ?
you calling me a liar ?
take a look at them apples
well you fellas drove a herd up here where is it ?
we got them grazing about a mile outside of the town here
well if you 'd run into a flock of cheyenne your herd would be bulging in cheyenne bellies by this time
then you are calling me a liar
gentlemen i open for 10
you gonna take that back or ain 't you ?
i UNknown l see that and i UNknown l raise it
answer me !
take that back now !
i don 't doubt your word
i just question your eyesight
you question my eyesight too mister ?
kings say 20
something smells of fish
i 'd purely love to have your scalp too
now texas you 'r e just talking yourself straight into the UNknown
i seen you operate on a horse once and you gonna give him a hand
it 's awful noisy in here
what about you ?
oh why did you shot him ?
while you 'r e thinking it over major
all right come on
oh no wyatt not the bar !
he UNknown l bleed all over it !
take him outside
it 's genuine UNknown wyatt !
blood will stain it
all right put him up on the bar
no not the bar

this is genuine UNknown from st louis
it 's gonna stain
hold it up high
don 't even blink
keep your eye right on homer

grant took richmond with less than that
well it never hurts to be prepared
well now mayor hold on

and the doctor here and me we UNknown l go forth and assume
ladies and gentle

southwest of course

there they are
but let 's get the hell out of here ?
come on grab
yes sir i told them we 'r e all scattered up and down the line
i haven 't even seen the captain in two days
there UNknown e been too many of these false alarms
we UNknown l have to wait until we can swear we saw them trying to cross the tracks
lf they haven 't crossed already
they can 't have done that
nobody could not even a rabbit could get through
you 'r e not talking about cheyenne
well tomorrow come sunup i 'm sending out my own patrols both sides of the river
have a snort
see that nice shiny boot ?
i UNknown l bite why ?
to hide whiskey bottles in
so climb off that high horse and drink me a little toast
you 'r e re UNknown as of right now
oh no i ain 't
oh yes you are
what have they got ?
they UNknown e got cossacks
you know what a cossack is ?
now he kills poles just because they 'r e poles
like we 'r e trying to kill indians just because they 'r e indians
i was proud to be an american soldier
but i ain 't proud to be a cossack
UNknown you UNknown e fought indians before
i fought indians who wanted to fight me
not just some poor starving blanket heads trying to go home !
all right mr UNknown
well sure tom
see you around
they must UNknown e UNknown when they heard you manure UNknown was coming
well sure i can read
means they UNknown e crossed
what sir ?
sergeant UNknown sir reporting for duty
sign me in
did the surgeon release you ?
i slipped away sir
well he slipped away too sir
what sir ?
well thank you sir
fort robinson is near here
lf we go there
we will die before we reach our homeland
there was hope in your heart when we started
where has it gone ?
maybe the hunger UNknown at our bellies has clawed my hope away too
why was i given this ?
if we go on the children will die
if we go to fort robinson you will speak for us ?
yes of course
off to your right
make them comfortable
would you be pulling the curtain ?
that must have been a terrible terrible journey
well it 's exhaustion and UNknown
oh it 's a horrible leg altogether
but we UNknown l feed her and keep her warm
and i 'm afraid after a while i 'm going to have to operate
captain archer sir
UNknown cooper knew little about indians but his books first made me interested in them
captain UNknown UNknown to mention that most of them are written in german
so captain you don 't believe that the indian should be wiped off the face of the earth along with the buffalo ?
no of course not
friend captain i 'm so happy to be warm and comfortable that nothing could bother me
but they surrendered voluntarily
they escaped from a reservation and are to be returned there
murder 's not routine
captain the fort area is restraint enough
where can they even try to go in this weather ?
this order came to me and to me is the responsibility
i can take no chances
you claim to be a doctor
you gonna let him put those women and children in a warehouse at 10 below zero ?
what are you gonna do about it ?
what are you gonna do about it ?
as ordered sir
all messages must be cleared through me
i read your report captain
it doesn 't begin to give a picture of this situation
well one must be tactful with higher authority
would you have me call them fools ?
they have given me an order
accept no more messages from this officer
he UNknown l accept this one because you can 't refuse to allow it
i have a month 's leave
i 'm requesting two weeks of it
i 'm not required to tell you why
lock the door
we will not go back
you have no other choice
if you try to force us
first i die
who in here speaks english ?
besides this ?
but the order stands
and you will further tell them that their chief this chief is brave but no longer wise
they must obey just as i obey
they will not go back
life there is not life
they will die here
they will die here
they will not go back
see that ?
but he 's young and strong thanks be to god so he got over it
i 'm throwing him out tomorrow
now what 's this huh ?
i UNknown l need it
you 'r e going away ?
i hope you UNknown l be here when i get back
t r a l n
miss wright if you please
i hope you know what you 'r e doing sir
let 's go
were you also told that the secretary is a very busy man ?
well sir i am also a very busy man
and what is your name ?
look sir i have to get back to fort robinson
fort robinson ?
come with me
yes that 's right
excuse me but i have an appointment with mr UNknown
the secretary judge
i didn 't recognize you
for what purpose ?
i 'm not supposed to discuss this outside of channels
well if it concerns the indians at fort robinson i 'm the channel
i 'd like to know why you 'r e risking your career your commission by questioning superior authority
i 'd like to know confidentially the truth
i don 't often manage to hear it
those indians are dying of cold and starvation in that prison
i only heard they were being what 's the word ?
and you 'd like me to do something about it ?
sir i only know what those cheyenne have gone through
if the people had seen it they wouldn 't have liked it
the people ?
they need your help sir
there 's a train at 7 this evening for the west
you UNknown l be on it
they sound like a thousand UNknown out there UNknown over the grave of UNknown
young lady you don 't seem to realize what you 'r e asking of me
you know the army is the only living that i have
now you listen to me for a minute and i UNknown l explain it to you
look when i was studying medicine on the continent it was read a book look at a corpse and say thank you for the license
well the civil war changed all that
civil war was my salvation
i stepped right off a boat and straight into uniform and i had a good sense to stay there
now all i UNknown e done ever since is hand out blue pills and give doses of castor oil
man alive i
you use the word lightly
now listen to me miss wright
you 'r e a quaker and you 'r e dedicated to self sacrifice while i 'm dedicated to self preservation
you want me to go out there don 't you ?
yeah and take me future me career and me pension and throw it down the drain
is that what you want huh ?
yeah well that 's exactly what i 'm going to do
captain you UNknown e got trouble on your hands
they have nothing to fight with
their bare hands maybe
none of them had to die
they could UNknown e walked out of there any time they liked
i have simply been the instrument of an order
an order i did not agree with
you say that as if you UNknown e memorized it
why don 't you talk to those indians ?
that is where the blame is
first it was the order from headquarters
now it 's the indians
everybody is to blame but you
i will not stand for any more insubordination
the truth of the matter is that you UNknown e
get out ! let this become a test of wills between you and the cheyenne
you have made it your own personal fight
you are a liar
i am a soldier
all my life i have given and taken orders
what would be this world without orders huh ?
what would be ?
well i will not let that start here
you are under arrest
you are mistaken captain
the regulations state that when an officer
yeah i know the regulations
due to UNknown
what did you see in this ? he may be removed
i am doing just that
you are the one with brain disease not me
i am doing just that sir
you UNknown l be court martialed and shot !

you are confined to quarters
mr peterson i am taking full responsibility
back to work !

well i 'm glad to see you mr secretary
riding all night didn 't help my lumbago
is that coffee i smell ?
yes i know i know
you 'r e all set
but not before i UNknown e had a chance to talk to those indians
well now this is hardly a civilian matter mr secretary
army coffee hasn 't improved in all these years
i have my orders from general sheridan sir
one question colonel
women children ?
then you UNknown l be pleased i came
the orders have been changed ?
the ground that you 'r e standing on is property controlled by the department of the interior

colonel i know i may be on shaky legal ground but that 's for the courts to decide
you ever had lumbago ?
no sir i UNknown e
they both speak english sir
but i 'm not here to make any promises
i 'm asking you to take a gamble

you keep us talking
you deserve to go back to your homeland and stay there in peace
i 'm sure that the people of this country will understand and will agree when they hear the facts
now will you take the gamble ?
the people ?
who will tell the people about fort robinson ?
you can have another greater victory here right now
he speaks the truth
maybe we can start a new custom

45 00 40 04 218 00 40 10 204 this time UNknown accepts his offer
prince UNknown we are honored with your return
it will be a pleasure to kill you
please my friend give it to me
what the humans do it 's in their nature honour the deal as we have done
the golden army !
wake up the army ?
but our fields will be flooded with blood
let the army to rest
if our end is near let us walk
for the last time i ask you my son
is this the path you want to take ?
then you leave me no choice
is there something you want to tell me ?
don 't do it
my son will you turn off that wretched puppet ?
brush your teeth
beg your pardon ?
howdy UNknown is real
you have to say good night
it 's not even a chimney pop
oh he has his ways
then i UNknown l wait up watch him do it !
no no no no stories tonight
and then i UNknown l brush my teeth i promise !
it is said that at the dawn of time man beast and all the magic beings lived together under the UNknown the father tree
but man has been created with a hole in his heart
a hole that no possession power or knowledge could fill
and in his infinite greed man dreamt of UNknown his dominion over the entire earth
the blood of many an UNknown ogre and UNknown was split in that wall with man
and king UNknown the one armed king of UNknown watched the slaughter in dread and despair
build me this army the king said
so a magical crown was forged that would allow those royal blood to command the golden army if UNknown
i 'm the king UNknown leader of the golden army
is there anyone who disputes my right ?
in his throne room no one challenged his word
most likely a challenge must be answered
but do you want to hear the end of this story or not ?
and the next time the humans marched they felt the earth tremble beneath their feet and saw the sky UNknown with monstrous shapes
the golden army had no remorse felt no loyalty or pain
and king UNknown 's heart grew heavy with regret
so he called a truce and divided the crown in three pieces
one of the humans and two for himself
in exchange man would keep to the cities and magical beings would own the forests
this truce will be honored by their sons and sons of their sons until the end of the time
but prince UNknown did not believe in the promises of man
and it is said that he went into exile UNknown to return the day his people needed him most
so the golden army laid dominate locked inside the earth waiting
and there it is to this day waiting the day the crown is made whole again silent still and indestructible
what does it mean UNknown ?
in des UNknown i UNknown
it means no one can destroy that
go to sleep my son
but it is just a story right pops ?
is it now ?
how long have you been there my friend ?
they are over there
i UNknown l go up first you UNknown l follow
and remember mr wink don 't be shy

so what have you said before about us going anywhere ?
anywhere you and me
clean air green hills
it 'd be great for the baby !
excellent the tobacco millionaire shall i take notes ?
no i will dictate in the UNknown of time
there 's a young lady wishes to see you mr holmes
this is not a convenient moment !
she 's very well spoken a genuine lady
it is a matter of great urgency mr holmes or i would not be troubling you on a saturday evening
perhaps you could uh delay your chemical reaction holmes
very well miss smith you must tell us your matter of great urgency
it is obviously not your health
so ardent a UNknown must be full of energy
yes i bicycle a good deal
slight UNknown on the side of the soles caused by the friction of the UNknown
oh yes !
i take my bicycle on the train with me as i did today
you will excuse me but it is my business
yes i nearly fell into the error of supposing you earned a living by UNknown but of course it is obviously music
you will observe watson the UNknown finger ends which is common to both UNknown
there is a UNknown about the face however which the typewriter does not generate
this lady is a musician
why yes mr holmes i teach music !
in the country i presume from your complexion
near UNknown on the borders of surrey !
but please let me explain why i am here
i am an only child and my father died some years ago
his name and profession ?
james smith he conducted the orchestra at the old lmperial theater
ah the old lmperial holmes
i think you wish to tell me that you and your mother are very poor not UNknown your obvious grace dignity and talent
we were very poor
you can imagine how excited we were for we thought that someone had left us a fortune
i went at once to the lawyers whose name was given in the paper
now this is miss violet smith
the solicitor introduced me to two men a mr carruthers and a mr woodley
they were on a visit from south africa
i wish i could tell you your uncle left you a vast fortune but as i said
he died in extreme poverty
however i myself am not without means
my mother and i never sought charity
no nor do i offer it
your uncle ralph said you were very musical do you teach music ?
so you see i do not offer charity
a job he wants to give you a job !
whereabouts in london do you live mr carruthers ?
i don 't
i couldn 't possibly leave my mother on her own
i will pay you 100 pounds a year
a hundred a year ?
oh at least !
so this is one of your weekend visits to london ?
for a while it was quite perfect
every monday morning i would take the train to UNknown and then bicycle from the station to the house
the little girl 's name was sarah and she was delightful as well as being a very good pupil
that was very much better sarah
may i try it again ?
of course that 's why we 'r e here
mr carruthers was UNknown of my work and an extremely kind and considerate host
miss smith i never guess
tell me about his visit
he arrived and was to stay for a week
but to me it seemed like three months
oh that odious red mustache !
one evening after dinner
a gentleman to see you sir
will you excuse me ?
that 's better
it 's better to get the old folk out of the way
i don 't regard mr carruthers as old
oh yes but he isn 't young
oh i don 't believe that for a moment
what don 't you believe ?
when women say they wish you wouldn 't do something it generally means the exact opposite
i mean precisely what i say !
mr woodley will you please leave me alone !
whatever do you mean ?
i 'm not very well up on the social graces but i 'm prepared to learn if you 'r e prepared to teach me
oh this is absurd !
it isn 't absurd !
i 'm asking you to marry me !
i mean it it 's from the heart
money isn 't a problem
i did very well out in south africa
whatever you are accustomed to i can give you better better that you 'r e accustomed to ; jewelry diamonds
you want diamonds oh i can give you diamonds
i don 't want diamonds !
oh you think about it
i won 't rush you
i UNknown e thought about it and the idea is UNknown
well you can 't blame me for trying !
you 'r e very beautiful
listen just to show there are no hard feelings what about a little kiss to be going on with hmm just a peck on the cheek
mr woodley will you please stop it !
oh i told you before about women who say stop it
mr carruthers will you stop him !
get out of this house !
all right !
i can only offer you my most sincere apologies for what has happened
if i give you my assurance that it will not happen again for my daughter 's sake will you stay ?
yes i will stay
the blackguard !
no he continues to be polite and considerate and courteous
now miss smith please please continue
yes there is something else
oh it may be a mere fancy of mine but it seems to me that mr carruthers shows a great deal of interest in me
oh he has never said anything he is a perfect gentleman but a girl always knows
so i believe
he is a kind and generous employer but i am already engaged
oh the name of this very fortunate young man is ? !
we 'r e to be married at the end of the summer
we wish you joy
it is an intriguing story to be sure but i sense you are frightened and do not understand why
you seem well capable of protecting yourself
please help me mr holmes !
what is it ?
there is one very quiet and lonely stretch of road that lies between UNknown heath on the one hand and the woods of UNknown hall on the other
two weeks ago today i was passing this place when i UNknown to look back and saw a man also on a bicycle
the following monday when i returned he was there again
have you mentioned this to your employer ?
but they UNknown e not yet arrived
and this morning ?
i slowed down but he did the same
then i stopped completely but he did the same
so i laid a trap for him
there is a sharp turning of the road and i UNknown very quickly towards this and then stopped and waited
but he seemed to disappear into thin air
can you describe this man ?
i realize that you UNknown e only seen him from a distance
young old ?
now let me see if i have the geography correct
here is the road with a sharp bend in it here
on this side UNknown heath and on the other the woods of UNknown hall
how long did you wait for him here around the bend ?
oh no more than two minutes
so he could not have retreated back down the road
are there any side roads ?
none along this stretch
oh the heath is totally flat and bleak
i think i would have noticed him
so by a process of UNknown we arrive at the fact that he made his way towards
oh he 's a rich man
but no carriages or horses
well at least he 's very well off
he goes into the city two or three times a week and he sometimes refers to his gold shares
yes i see
i am extremely busy just now but i will find time to make inquiries into your case
thank you mr holmes
i 'm sure we shall have nothing but good news for you
i do hope so dr watson
very lovely girl
you really think she may be in some danger holmes ?
i selected the only available cover and waited
watson you have wasted your time
i thought i did rather well
no your hiding place was ill chosen
you should have been in the bracken on the other side of the road
then that way you would have had a close view of this fascinating solitary UNknown
you describe him as bending low over the handle bar ?
yes quite low
oh know you really have done remarkably badly
he goes back to the hall and you come all the way back to london to call on a house agent
well i found the information i was seeking
you found the name UNknown which UNknown nothing to my mind
well we know he 's elderly and respectable
and therefore unlikely to be the energetic UNknown that UNknown away from that athletic young girl
well what should i have done ?
gone to the nearest public house
that is the center of country gossip
they would have given you every name from the master to the scullery maid
instead of which you give me UNknown
so what have we gained by your expedition
the fact that the girl 's story is true ;
i never doubted that
i never doubted that either
the hall is UNknown by a man called UNknown
who is the better for that ?
i shall go back tomorrow and visit the public house
no my dear sir do not commit yourself to UNknown because you are temporarily depressed
we can do nothing useful until saturday
did i really do remarkably badly ?
i need to practice it more
no i don 't mean the music
violet i have a question to ask you
now carruthers has proposed marriage to her
of course he didn 't know about cyril
are you going to UNknown ?
i want to test one or two theories which i have formed
shall i come with you ?
no that will be neither useful nor necessary
try the nearest public house always a good center for country gossip
thank you watson capital notion !
ah good afternoon landlord
that 's most generous of you sir but i couldn 't
i haven 't done anything to warrant such generosity
i 'm about to give you the opportunity
i need some information
neither am i i prefer facts
tell me about the people at UNknown hall
you mean mr UNknown sir ?
you just missed him
is he an elderly respectable gentleman ?
oh he 's elderly no doubt
far be it from me to speak ill of people behind their backs but i 'm none too sure about respectable
that 's doctors that are struck off
tell me about the other people up at the house
well they 'r e just domestic staff and they 'r e all local and god fearing
oh they 'r e a warm lot
that 's good
they don 't come down well in the village i can tell you
there was one fellow in particular
particularly warm is he this fellow ?
he is very particularly sir
i UNknown l wager he has a red mustache
hey do you know him ?
i never met the gentleman
well now is your chance
our landlord keeps a very respectable house and your language is not welcome
who do you think you are ?
what the hell do you want coming here asking all them questions ?
you 'r e quite right landlord clearly not a gentleman
oh i 'm as much a gentleman as you are
everybody here will bear witness to the fact that i am acting in self defense
only a ruffian deals a blow with the back of a hand
a gentleman uses the straight left and i sir am a gentleman !
it was absolutely delicious watson
so i see
i emerged as you see
and the UNknown ruffian ?
mr woodley was taken home in a cart
there 's that horrible man again
which man ?
but do not worry i have told him quite firmly he 's not to set foot inside the house
dear mr holmes
the odious mr woodley has UNknown at UNknown grange
ah but at least she won 't be UNknown to the station
so finally the rich mr carruthers has acquired a horse and trap
tomorrow holmes all her troubles will be over
why do i worry about that word
which word ?
it 's acceptable weather for the time of year
now who would want to harm that dear girl on such a morning ?
i hope nobody
i 'm talking about my hope not my UNknown UNknown
she must be traveling by an earlier train
i give her a margin of half an hour but she UNknown l be past UNknown hall before we can possibly meet her
so what can we do ?
we could run
it 's abduction
stop that horse
up there !
where is miss violet smith ? !
that 's what i 'm asking you
you were in her cart !
it was on the road there was no one in it !
somebody seems to have gone through this way !
we must find them !
that 's peter the groom he was taking her to the station
he 's alive his pulse is strong
mustn 't be left lying there too long
let him lie we can 't do him any good but we might save her from the worst fate that can befall a woman
where are you going ? !
the house !
they went this way to the left
are you sure ?
for as much as john and violet have consented together in holy wedlock and have witnessed the same before god and this company
and have declared the same by the giving and receiving of a ring and the joining of hands
i pronounce that they be man and wife together
welcome to the party gentlemen
let me introduce you to mrs woodley
don 't carruthers !
you 'r e too late
she is my wife !
no she 's your widow
i told you what i 'd do if you molested her !
by the lord i 'm a man of my word !
when you hired me nobody told me there 'd be any of this damn nonsense !
drop that pistol
give me that revolver we UNknown l have no more violence
who are you to be giving these orders ?
yes sir i reckon i am
then give this note to the superintendent of the police station
in the meantime
how are the patients doctor ?
miss smith 's very well considering the foul way she 's been treated
and woodley ?
what i UNknown l go upstairs and finish him off
no sit down in that chair carruthers
you 'r e right
but do you tell me that girl is to be tied to roaring jack woodley for life ? !
you needn 't concern yourself about that
i married them till death do them part
under no circumstances can she be considered his wife
are you sure ?
in the first place we are very safe in questioning mr UNknown 's right to UNknown a marriage
i have been ordained
i think not
oh we had a license
i have it here
but in any case a forced marriage is no marriage indeed it is a very serious felony as you will discover
now while we are waiting for the police mr carruthers you might tell me your story
if you squeal on us bob carruthers
i UNknown l serve you as you served jack woodley !
there 's no need for you to get over excited
the case is clear enough
well if it 's clear enough why don 't you tell us
in the first place the three of you came across from south africa
wrong i UNknown e never even been in south africa !
it 's true
very well you and woodley had known ralph smith in south africa
you had reason to believe that he would not live long and you found out that his niece would inherit his fortune
how 's that ?
well as he was still alive UNknown only just and a wealthy man who i suspect had made no will
ralph smith could neither read nor write
so you and woodley came over here and hunted up the girl knowing she was the next of kin and that you would share the plunder
i was due a share for services rendered
and carruthers you made the mistake of falling in love with her
the first time that ever i knew what love was mr holmes
why didn 't you tell her of the danger she was in ?
because because she would have left me and i couldn 't bear to face that
oh what will happen to my daughter sarah ?
we UNknown l see she 's well taken care of
you see even if she couldn 't love me it meant a great deal to see her about the house and hear the sound of her voice
you may call it love mr carruthers
i should call it selfishness
maybe the two things go together
but i tried to protect her
i never once let her go past this house where i knew those rascals were lurking without following her on my bicycle to see she came to no harm
i kept my distance and wore that beard so she should not recognize me
then i presume the cable arrived ?
cable what cable ?
what old man ?
woodley came back again to ask me to stick to the bargain
one last detail why was woodley chosen as the prospective husband ?
i am ashamed to say it
we played cards for her
holmes i have the results of the trial
listen to this the judge in UNknown up said
go on then
UNknown seven years and carruthers in view of the eloquent speech i made on his behalf at the trial probably six months
that is exactly right !
well i have certain advantages watson
largely the fact that i sent out for the early edition
an UNknown advantage
looking after young sarah carruthers while her father is in custody
her piano playing is improving and she wants to take up UNknown
a splendid day all round wouldn 't you say ?
there is more splendor yet to come
more splendor what do you mean ?
is that the answer holmes ?
yes that is the answer watson
well let me think
great success thanks to the perfect mastery of the eldest russian director UNknown who adapted the work of the great writer
several years have gone by
the UNknown art has made huge progress
and yet father UNknown still stands as an important UNknown in the cinema history of our country and has lost none of its artistic value
the father of prince UNknown UNknown of the guard in retirement had pronounced as he lay dying his wish that his son followed a career in the army
and would have been an outstanding cadet if not for his violent temperament
these chops are UNknown !
nikolai UNknown often came to visit the regiment
with 18 years old UNknown was promoted to officer of the aristocratic regiment of the guard
and as always
but he had one secret goal to obtain the most brilliant position in high society
countess UNknown one of the empress favorite maids of honor was at first very cold towards him
the dances will soon begin
first the UNknown
you are dancing you are having fun i am pleased very pleased
you have promised me the UNknown countess
i am tired
she is nikolai 's mistress
people are beginning to talk about us
it would be good if you could find a husband
but maybe it is possible
i understand your highness
two months after UNknown proposes
look how beautiful it is over there
i would like to receive an answer
as mother wants it
mother and what if he finds out ?
but if he loves you truly he will forgive you if he finds out
on the wedding 's eve
you know in the beginning i wanted to get closer to you in a way not entirely UNknown but then
you are not angry at me ?
i must say everything
by marrying me you wanted to smother all this
on the same day
my decision is firm
i must speak to the father superior
three years later prince stepan UNknown went into holy orders by the name of UNknown
four years later UNknown was transferred to a large monastery in the capital
tomorrow will you celebrate the mass ?
the superior was a skillful man that had achieved his UNknown career with the aid of his relations in high circles
and couldn 't i see my old comrade father UNknown ?
it 's that prince UNknown
i 'm happy to see you in this angel appearance
abbot you expose myself to temptations
in order to avoid any temptation
UNknown becomes a hermit in the far away UNknown desert
in the nearby town
i can 't stand it
i 'm bored
careful it 's loaded !
this is the road to UNknown
i UNknown l spend the night over at UNknown 's
dear lord why won 't you give me faith ?
come get me at three o UNknown lock in the morning
allow me to come inside
i 'm freezing
i 'm looking for a refuge
i wandered away from the path and if i hadn 't stumbled upon your cell
don 't come in
don 't come in
listen help me !
what 's wrong ?
go away !
you have really won you bet
cure him father
next to father UNknown cell some monks set up a big church was built
little father don 't leave us
until tomorrow today i can 't
but you don 't look like a monk today my precious
in the evening the merchant ordered his daughter to prepare
holy father !
it 's been two years since she lost her reason
she doesn 't go out during the day she 's afraid of the light
i have seen you in my dreams
i saw that you would lay your hand on my chest here like this
what 's UNknown you pull yourself together !
really now !
give me the axe
i 'm going to UNknown to see father UNknown
UNknown is not longer there
not any more
god was not there
he was UNknown among the UNknown judged and sent to siberia

but you don 't look like a monk today my precious
in the evening the merchant ordered his daughter to prepare
holy father !

give me the axe
i 'm going to UNknown to see father UNknown
UNknown is no longer there
not any more
god was not there
he was UNknown among the UNknown judged and sent to siberia
you 'd think i 'd never done this
come with us tonight as we travel along with
i UNknown l get there
that wasn 't bad
traveling along with that special breed of hero we like to call the fire department
we should have come earlier
we could be going with them
well that 's cool
you prefer bob or robert ?
bob 's good
this might surprise most people but 85 percent of the calls we go out on are medical
it can be anything from chest pain to more serious things
how do you handle that with ambulances and hospitals ?
most ambulances you see are fire department
i didn 't know that
at least that 's the direction it 's going
one more question something i 'm sure we 'r e all wondering
do UNknown still slide down those fabulous poles ?
we sure do
i 'm glad i didn 't wear a skirt
that could really hurt your legs
tell me bob how do you get down when you 'r e wearing a skirt ?
we 'r e going to the dining hall
wherever they go you go
we UNknown l talk after
well would you like some ?
firemen are really good cooks
yeah that 's what i hear
yeah i 'm game
you filming this ?
pretend it 's not even there
give me a level ?
just talk free
i don 't know what to say
i mean am i gonna have this thing on all the time ?
yeah just watch what you say
we UNknown l hear everything
but it helps if you 'r e not dropping f bombs
it 's gonna be a long night
so this thing ?
that 's what it is
can you get it ?
we use this in the
the firemen would use this
we should bring it down ?
so this was used in the UNknown UNknown and the UNknown UNknown
oh my god
and then when they got to that windowsill they would hook it again
and then pull themselves up
you see this ?
they stopped using it around
hold it up higher
yeah and rope
those are little UNknown
the fires were bigger and they were smaller
don 't tell captain we took this down
i 'm not gonna tell him i touched it
i wanna introduce you to somebody
this is wilshire
well there 's a reason why the UNknown were in cartoons
the fire department has a great sense of tradition
yeah we do
important when the fire trucks were horse drawn
now they 'r e used as UNknown
but what they 'r e trained to do is run in and stop the traffic
kind of like UNknown
sort of like what a siren does today
okay well wilshire can show you what to do in case you catch on fire
stop drop and roll
i 'm on fire
tell me what to do
so it 's stop drop and roll in case you catch on fire
you all hang out a lot ?
yeah we definitely live together
i UNknown l show it to you
it 's nice right ?
exciting i guess
not if you 'r e losing
every time you know we go respond to a call the points reset
depending on which side you 'r e on it 's sort of nice
works in your favor from time to time ?
not in my favor
i never lose
i can see you doing that
the pole hole is over here
the pole hole
you got the locker room here
our viewers always like to see action so maybe we should go into the locker room
let 's go in the locker room
you got it
okay towel up guys
female on the deck
he 's got one major talent so come this way
he 's got a huge talent
we 'r e not using this
oh my god
this is adding a whole new meaning to the term fireman 's hose
hey hit the floor
plenty of female UNknown
yeah it 's a lot harder than it seems
keep the door closed
i bet you 10 i can do it better
you all can be my witnesses
that 's too easy
i think we 'r e done here
we got everything we need
here we go
behind the line
you wanna go back outside ?

what we UNknown l do is we UNknown l roll him on his side
we just have to be really careful
what time is it ?
one thirty seven
they UNknown e given us no information cut off communication from UNknown UNknown and cell phones to the building 's cable and internet
the people trapped here myself included can 't help but ask why

i basically got a pharmacy up there
you can 't arrest me for that because of self UNknown
sir you are the least of my worries right now okay ?
all right i was just asking
i 'm going
no i UNknown e never seen anything like this
mostly because i 'm a vet
i don 't usually treat people
dogs and cats mostly
how are the injured men doing ?
they both lost a lot of blood and the fireman over here he 's got a bunch of broken bones and probable internal bleeding
apparently mrs UNknown attacked and bit them in some kind of a fit
but honestly i find that a little hard to believe that an old lady could do something like this to two grown men
how old are you UNknown ?
with my mom and my dad and my dog max
where is he ?
you sound a little sick yourself
you know what ?
it UNknown the audience when people talk from off camera

she has a fever she 's confused
she has some degree of paralysis and delirium
these are all UNknown symptoms
are you sure ?
are you trying to tell me these people have UNknown ?
tears saliva fever
but here 's the thing
UNknown takes months for symptoms to show
this is taking minutes
how does UNknown spread ?
through bites ?
blood saliva any UNknown UNknown
so if you get their blood on you you 'r e okay
but if you get their blood on you and it gets into a cut into your mouth eyes then you 'r e not okay
how 's it cured ?
no there 's no cure
people get shots in their stomach
before symptoms starts showing

you 'd think i 'd never done this
come with us tonight as we travel along with
come with us tonight as we paint the town red on
sorry a little off my a game
i UNknown l get there
that wasn 't bad
on tonight 's we 'r e in los angeles traveling along with that special breed of hero we like to call the fire department
we should have come earlier
we could be going with them
well that 's cool
you prefer bob or robert ?
bob 's good
this might surprise most people but 85 percent of the calls we go out on are medical
it can be anything from chest pain to more serious things
how do you handle that with ambulances and hospitals ?
most ambulances you see are fire department
i didn 't know that
at least that 's the direction it 's going
one more question something i 'm sure we 'r e all wondering
do UNknown still slide down those fabulous poles ?
we sure do
i 'm glad i didn 't wear a skirt
that could really hurt your legs
tell me bob how do you get down when you 'r e wearing a skirt ?
we 'r e going to the dining hall
wherever they go you go
we UNknown l talk after
well would you like some ?
firemen are really good cooks
yeah that 's what i hear
yeah i 'm game
you filming this ?
pretend it 's not even there
give me a level ?
just talk free
i don 't know what to say
i mean am i gonna have this thing on all the time ?
yeah just watch what you say
we UNknown l hear everything
but it helps if you 'r e not dropping f bombs
it 's gonna be a long night
so this thing ?
that 's what it is
can you get it ?
we use this in the
the firemen would use this
we should bring it down ?
so this was used in the UNknown UNknown and the UNknown UNknown
oh my god
and then when they got to that windowsill they would hook it again
and then pull themselves up
you see this ?
they stopped using it around
hold it up higher
yeah and rope
those are little UNknown
the fires were bigger and they were smaller
don 't tell captain we took this down
i 'm not gonna tell him i touched it
i wanna introduce you to somebody
this is wilshire
well there 's a reason why the UNknown were in cartoons
the fire department has a great sense of tradition
yeah we do
important when the fire trucks were horse drawn
now they 'r e used as UNknown
but what they 'r e trained to do is run in and stop the traffic
kind of like UNknown
sort of like what a siren does today
okay well wilshire can show you what to do in case you catch on fire
stop drop and roll
i 'm on fire
tell me what to do
so it 's stop drop and roll in case you catch on fire
you all hang out a lot ?
yeah we definitely live together
i UNknown l show it to you
it 's nice right ?
exciting i guess
not if you 'r e losing
every time you know we go respond to a call the points reset
depending on which side you 'r e on it 's sort of nice
works in your favor from time to time ?
not in my favor
i never lose
i can see you doing that
the pole hole is over here
the pole hole
you got the locker room here
our viewers always like to see action so maybe we should go into the locker room
let 's go in the locker room
you got it
okay towel up guys
female on the deck
he 's got one major talent so come this way
he 's got a huge talent
we 'r e not using this
oh my god
this is adding a whole new meaning to the term fireman 's hose
hey hit the floor
plenty of female UNknown
yeah it 's a lot harder than it seems
keep the door closed
i bet you 10 i can do it better
you all can be my witnesses
that 's too easy
i think we 'r e done here
we got everything we need
here we go
behind the line
you wanna go back outside ?
see what they 'r e up to ?
why not ?
will you turn up his mike ?
you didn 't catch no eye
here give me some of that
i UNknown l tell you all right ?

that 's how you do pick and roll
oh yeah ?

scott i am still living the dream
keep calling out numbers
well jake 's the engineer

when i see a girl i rate them
so if i say there 's a eight at 3 o UNknown lock the guys know they better look to the right

a 35 mm copy provided by UNknown UNknown 's family was screened then
in UNknown rosario 's film society rendered it into a 16 mm copy
the technician fernando UNknown UNknown was in charge of the project
since the 35 mm copy is considered lost the new restored cut had to be made from the 16 mm version preserved by the UNknown del UNknown
according to film society member alfredo UNknown and historian jorge miguel UNknown the original cut had several colour tones something usual in those days
those colour tones were lost during the 16 mm UNknown in which only b w film was used
in order to restore that
UNknown 's notes were checked and also the UNknown of film society member UNknown UNknown who was able to observe the original film
UNknown extension was also improved
in the 16 mm version UNknown extension had been distorted because UNknown UNknown had to copy almost all UNknown from stills choosing the most clearer ones
some UNknown formerly UNknown due to poor contrast were also restored
a new title was made inspired in the original design and a likely correct speed for projection was estimated
the last UNknown UNknown by dr UNknown UNknown
prologue UNknown and the UNknown
the newspapers widely reported the sad events that took place there
la UNknown buenos aires
seriousness of the events
it won 't be the sick poetry imported from paris nor the pulp fiction nor the romance
it will be the story of a strong and heroic american tribe which spread legends through the UNknown jungle
former deputy dr UNknown and dr UNknown debate about the script of this film
mr UNknown thinks that
a UNknown UNknown woman
the tribe 's old chief UNknown lopez
the rebel chief salvador lopez leader of the UNknown UNknown
don UNknown UNknown the tribe 's UNknown poet
he like don quixote rides a skinny horse
juan UNknown n a crazy UNknown UNknown who does a forward roll howls like the fox and cries like the UNknown southern UNknown
the UNknown ancient owners of that land were UNknown
they fish s UNknown UNknown UNknown using a UNknown a kind of harpoon made of UNknown and a piece of iron or hard wood
they use modern weapons for hunting UNknown UNknown UNknown and wild ducks that UNknown the nearby UNknown
they use UNknown for hunting ostrich a highly profitable activity given its tasty meat
they hunt UNknown a dangerous animal that lives in water UNknown such as UNknown and streams
they use a thick fishing line a spear and meat
the UNknown eat the meat through the night
the UNknown are UNknown in the local ranches of san javier
they get drunk at the local UNknown as tavern
the white people pushed them to drink
now they punish them and even take them to jail for drinking
while the UNknown were living in misery the tribe 's old chief bernardo lopez was living like a king in the land that the government had given to him
rosa UNknown a beautiful half breed girl was his loving companion
jesus salvador the old chief 's brother missed the old days when he would roam in the woods
he regretted the day when he and his people were UNknown to san javier by a UNknown missionary brother
who he was secretly in love with
the tribe 's poor living conditions the hatred he felt toward his brother and his love for rosa UNknown him to dream of becoming the UNknown 's chief
salvador visits bernardo in order to convince him of taking care of the people
bernardo sleeping all day long ; our people are hungry
go talk to the police chief and get our land back
i won 't make chief UNknown angry !
i won 't ask for anything !
take this necklace made of UNknown and UNknown teeth
wear this and you will defeat the white and become chief !
i bless you jesus our savior !
act ii the conspiracy
the reason why i have summoned you is that i am tired of working for the UNknown tired of suffering
bernardo is not helping the indian
the UNknown have taken our land
our people are starving
UNknown have lots of arms
UNknown and winchesters
we can 't fight them !
UNknown will bring troops from santa fe in order to defeat us
chief UNknown is mean
he has forbidden the ball
the police chief has been taking away our daughters and sisters
together we can defeat the UNknown !
saint francisco javier will protect the UNknown
the bullets will turn into mud
the indian will fight using indian weapons
the UNknown will turn into pigs and the town will be ours
their women and houses will belong to us !
juan and UNknown s are cowards just like chief bernardo
they fear the gringo
i will be his woman
you will be chief salvador 's wife and the gringo 's daughters will be your servants
the UNknown messengers were quickly sent to santa rosa and san mart n in order to spread the news about the UNknown revolt
several UNknown families UNknown to san javier in a two year period
strange ceremonies were held at night
each indian swore to be loyal to the UNknown cause and to keep the rebellion a secret
they left an amulet in the chapel the same they would wear the day of the battle
those UNknown who were still loyal to chief bernardo took care of his affairs
jesus salvador was proclaimed chief by the tribe UNknown
the day of the uprising was approaching and that year the UNknown pushed the boat out to celebrate san javier 's day
the UNknown celebrated through five days and nights
the executed their traditional dances
the dancing partners
they were bailed out if they paid in money cigars or alcohol
the UNknown sang amusing and kind of UNknown tunes though they were not refined
mr san javier !
us the poor ones !
turn around again UNknown UNknown
the turn you have made you UNknown e made it in reverse
dance dance UNknown
dance dance UNknown
your love affairs are like a UNknown
like a UNknown
mr pancho UNknown
rosa who had been forbidden to dance by the chief remained seated among the old ladies absorbed in sad thoughts
she rejected many gentlemen that had invited her to dance
but she couldn 't resist one who didn 't care about bernardo 's orders
bernardo sees that his orders were not obeyed
and forces rosa to comeback home
you were dancing with salvador that thief !
don 't insult him !
i UNknown l teach you !
the next day two of bernardo 's men took rosa to a faraway corner in the islands
rosa was kept in there for several weeks in exile thinking about salvador
UNknown one of salvador 's loyal helpers had tracked her down
every night while the guardians were asleep
UNknown visited rosa and told her about salvador and his plans
chief salvador sends this UNknown national flower of argentina
and UNknown for the day
i UNknown l keep you up to date
they had moved away a large amount of stolen cattle to the islands
several farmers were killed in their own land
not even the bullets could hold the hungry of UNknown back
the land owners and farmers constantly complained to the police chief
the UNknown who prefer mare meat over any other kind would not miss a chance of satisfying their appetite
many UNknown were arrested for committing such crimes
this UNknown urged UNknown s salvador to quickly gather together all his followers
juan and UNknown s salvador brothers were planning to murder chief bernardo
bernardo found shelter at the police station
meanwhile the people in the town became aware of the imminent danger
women and children panicked
the battle was about to start
the sky over san javier turned UNknown black and a tempest broke in the islands
rosa hears the ostrich booming
it was the sign she was expecting
the rebellion had just started and she decides to act
bring some water from the well
there you go !
evil woman !
at noon the UNknown interrupted the communications by cutting the telegraph wire
the governor of santa fe received the following message
thousands of UNknown indians
the newspapers reported out the terrible events
town inhabitants were slaughtered
thousands of UNknown indians
they are attacking the town
meanwhile in santa fe rumor had it that the storm hadn 't have started yet in san javier
gaucho UNknown luna went to see the UNknown in order to claim the horses they had stolen from him
hey you chief of thieves give back the horses you have stolen from me
indian did not steal any horse old luna
how dare you !
they are going to kill luna !
the battle ended
san javier 's brave UNknown went after the fugitives
the wounded UNknown hid in the rushes and tried to heal their wounds
that night in the ranches
the neighbors set the UNknown UNknown on fire
act vi chasing the indian
the capital city sent the police force
several groups went out to watch out the surroundings where the indians had supposedly committed terrible crimes
the defeated UNknown ran away toward the islands heading the gran UNknown avoiding the northern towns
one group of rebels remained standing
commanded by salvador they had changed their objective
they couldn 't conquer the town but they would capture bernardo
they wanted revenge
the police UNknown the group of rebels
UNknown s salvador and his loyal UNknown managed to go in san javier in order to reach the islands
at the sunset the two UNknown
living symbols of defeat approach shack where rosa UNknown was kept prisoner
that poor half breed girl was still tied to the post
all of a sudden an awful scene took place in front of her sad eyes
they were heading gran UNknown the land of the indian taking unknown routes on their way
jesus salvador was the chief of rosa UNknown 's heart
the restless indian who fought against civilization took from it its sweetest legacy
the kiss which was unknown to his people
program max UNknown the end

during our attack UNknown disappeared
as if by magic the little house was quickly rebuilt by our brave soldiers
disturbed by the frightening descriptions of the war
UNknown lines up face to face
UNknown his favourite puppet UNknown ingenious brave
UNknown clumsy UNknown cruel
but UNknown mustn 't surrender
because he 's magical and immortal
desperate situations call for desperate measures

uh it 's UNknown
she went in her sleep
nobody beats stage four trevor
hey i told you you can 't buy weed here
doing you a favor bro
there 's a UNknown and a UNknown UNknown your door
police radio chatter
and at least three different sets of footprints
beat him down dragged him to the safe
pressed his print to the UNknown lock here
there 's blood on the UNknown pad
if this is the same four man crew
that hit the other UNknown it 's a big UNknown
maybe he didn 't want to give up the safe
a gang of heavily strapped guys shove guns in your face
you give up the safe
not if you 'r e trevor knight
he was a pro UNknown out of hawaii
with a rep for hitting the bottle
a real laid back UNknown dude
what 's more laid back than dead ?
when did you find the body ?
uh just before 6 00
trevor has me come in early to pick up deliveries
for shut ins
some of grow ops are offering UNknown
and foot rubs and all kinds of stuff
these gouge marks on the side of your boss truck
any idea who did that ?
probably one of the neighbors
they don 't really like having a dispensary next door
any of them dislike it more than others ?
i couldn 't say man
you know some kid stopped in yesterday
and claimed there was a UNknown in a blue UNknown
casing the place but
do you know how much was in the safe ?
trevor handled the cash
we UNknown l need to see the books
trevor 's wife UNknown 's got the books
uh trevor kept them at home to protect the customers
from what ?
oh like that doesn 't happen ?
why don 't you just give us her address ?
it 's legal dope
or the head scarf speak for itself ?
it 's okay
he and UNknown should UNknown e been back in hawaii
where he could train properly
me and my little friend UNknown
we need to see the financial records of the grow op
i have them upstairs
while he UNknown his UNknown career
i know this is difficult
but can you think of anyone at all
who might have had a dispute with your son ?
i know my son 's reputation
but he gave up fighting
when he quit drinking and married UNknown
he was thinking of starting a family
you 'r e good at that
a UNknown youth and three years in vice
they didn 't have to kill him
it wasn 't my choice to come back to the mainland
it wasn 't my choice to sell weed
but once trevor made up his mind
bank statements and vendor accounts
you happen to know the weekly take at the grow op ?
around 20 000
but trevor never UNknown it as a permanent business
how about the safe ?
you have any idea how much was in there ?
a little over 100 000
the armored car company
but trevor kept missing the pick ups
every time he had to take his mom to the hospital
the company warned us about keeping too much cash on hand
that 's why they insisted we install that safe last month
not that it made a damn bit of difference
so maybe it was a robbery crew
okay we got five jobs over a two month period
hit and split pros
making it open season on drug dealers
state UNknown dealers
and sheriffs jurisdiction
all varied their pickup UNknown
okay let 's UNknown from the UNknown case 100 000 taken from a newly installed safe
who knew how much would be in the safe ?
the victim the wife and the armored car company
including the secretaries
which you installed
he was missing deposits every other week
the safe was better than nothing
that green truck isn 't that your competition 's ?
it used to be
bought out a bunch of the smaller players
we 'r e still UNknown operations
are UNknown and t w z securities
two of those smaller players ?
these operations you consolidated
we 'r e just UNknown everyone 's paperwork
we noticed you used your maiden name
on your job application
when 's the last time you saw him ?
not long enough ago
this is your signature on the visitor 's log
from UNknown 10 days ago yeah ?
husband 's a prisoner there
not so bad that he didn 't rate a UNknown visit
that 's what it says in the visitor 's log
one hour UNknown visit
you used your maiden name to conceal the fact
that you 'r e married to an armed robber
so you could get a job here
we also think that your husband
the armed robber
at the five dope UNknown
UNknown by your company 's armored cars
i want a deal
my husband owed a guy a favor he met inside
was trevor knight in harbor city on the list ?
right at the top

we got a story
until at a UNknown in harbor city
someone dropped a body
and a ticket for a hot shot from the state of california
no you know your rights
i 'm not gonna let you pin a murder on me
what happened in harbor city ?
nothing happened in harbor city
we were never in harbor city
okay yeah we did the other ones okay ?
we heard it was top of your list
i staked it out
chased off a big bad boy like you ?
you 'd bail too if big ass UNknown
shoved a UNknown off UNknown in your face
paint us a picture of this UNknown
sons of UNknown ?
no the dude drove off before i could ask
describe the UNknown 's car
it 's a uh a UNknown
35 old school s o s
pinched for robbery
a robbery crew was casing a harbor city weed store
we think he ran them off
so he could rob the place himself
s i d found three sets of shoe prints on the scene
any idea who he 'd be working with ?
well UNknown 's kind of low man on the UNknown order
could be s o s
could be he UNknown out on his own
any emergency contacts on the booking reports ?
the contact he gave his parole officer
is a UNknown UNknown knight rolling hills
trevor knight 's wife
really ? cause right now it looks like
you and joey UNknown conspired to kill your husband
you didn 't want to move here
you didn 't want to sell weed
and 100 000
are you telling me that joey killed trevor ?
you know different ?
it didn 't last long
it was a mistake
if he gave your name to his p o
joey was trevor 's silent partner
he lent trevor the money to start the grow op 30 000
joey was the only one we knew with that kind of cash
trevor gave him a cut every week
dealing with your ex didn 't bother trevor ?
pro UNknown don 't make anything unless they win
that 's why trevor was training so hard
so he could get back on the circuit
and we could walk away from the grow op
what did joey think of your exit plan ?
i wouldn 't even know how to find him
she UNknown a good story
assuming it 's true
why settle for 10 when you can get 100 ?
the old UNknown who worked for trevor
he might know something about joey
i uh i
why don 't you come on out here ?
and leave your door wide open for days
now it 's all punk ass kids and 30 people fighting
for the same bit of sand
that 's a nasty looking cut on your cheek
and the way you 'r e holding those two fingers
i 'd say they 'r e broke
tripped on something in the parking lot
well that thing you tripped on
didn 't happen to look like him did it ?
you know who that is though
is that who paid you a visit ?
he came in
he thought i killed trevor and took the money
joey told you that ?
funny thing i said i thought he might UNknown e done it
and he just said if he 'd wanted to kill trevor
he 'd done it clean back at the beach
which beach ?
blow that up
we have a warrant !
no don 't hurt him !
ma 'a m get out of the way !
joey we have a warrant for you !
get out of my house !
joey step away from the girl !
you bastards get out !

i can 't breathe !
i can 't breathe !

i didn 't do knight
knight took your woman
UNknown didn 't play up to you to get the 30 000
to open the grow op ?
make you think she still cared ?
maybe she did
knight was my meal ticket
knight was planning to close the grow op
the grow op was nothing
compared to what i was gonna make off of knight 's UNknown
what do you mean ?
i was gonna front all his expenses in return
for 40 of everything
we were negotiating
i was looking to help the guy
how were you gonna help him ?
knight was gonna surf this UNknown next month

so i went by his house to check it out
what 'd he say ?
he said the UNknown was out of line

a week later he comes by apologized again

his favorite was all bashed up
like somebody had taken a hammer to it

trevor didn 't say
too many bodies only so many waves
most of these look like variations of the same tag

hey can 't you people read UNknown ?

the beach is public property from san UNknown
all the way to oregon
or do you need me to come up there and draw you a map ?
it 's only public to the high tide line
this idiot 's out here shaking his fist every day
thinks if he makes it hard enough to use the beach
people will stop trying
you know sharks can 't write
we 'r e trying to help

you know bust his board key his ride
but knight wouldn 't back down
who suggested you visit knight at his UNknown ?
there was all this blood
we we panicked
said we should make it look like a robbery
where 's all e money now ?
that 's right
we also have a search warrant for your house
i need you boys to stand up
i UNknown l be right behind you
don 't answer any questions
are we clear ?
video has been taken to document their physical condition
so don 't even think of getting rough with them
don 't worry mr
your people almost done ripping our home apart ?
just your son 's room and the UNknown areas
don 't worry
to show we haven 't UNknown up your UNknown
did i do something to earn your resentment ?
with all due respect mr
neither is your son
like pat scott
UNknown have the right UNknown safe
in their own UNknown
spare me the greater public good
public good ends when i catch it UNknown on my UNknown
maybe you should UNknown for more public UNknown
you know back in the day
my dad used to pack me and my brothers up in a UNknown
drive to the beach all the way from boyle heights
spend the whole day swimming in the surf
fall asleep listening to the waves
made the rest of the week UNknown
the california promise
if you UNknown l excuse me
i don 't believe your warrant covers this room
people v carlton campbell and logan UNknown
how do you plead ?
the people request the defendant be held
without bail your honor
they also have deep family and community ties
they face counts that carry the death penalty
they have the financial means to flee the jurisdiction
i 'm with ms
my clients had nothing to do with knight 's murder
pat scott acted alone
he somehow used three pairs of shoes ?
the footprint sizes match your clients
lots of people wear sizes 9 and 11
and your star witness is a UNknown liar
what 's this ?
at carlton campbell 's house
it 's always good to see you ricardo
she was drunk
meaning she couldn 't legally consent
meaning you raped her
pushing me to do it
they cheered me on
carlton 's dad covered it up
just like he did with the kid we beat up outside paco paco 's
gray campbell paid off a victim ?
it was just like the thing with knight
we were in it together
and things got out of control
if our only witness is an admitted UNknown
our case just went from thin to UNknown
three dumb kids did not commit the perfect crime
s i d couldn 't find anything at campbell or UNknown 's house
to link them to knight 's murder
no bloody clothes or shoes
next to the fireplace
something must UNknown e been hard to burn
if they needed a boost from lighter fluid
carlton burned evidence in daddy 's fireplace
or daddy burned it for him
the study wasn 't covered under the search warrant
the lighter fluid 's in plain sight
talk to the judge
lab tests from the chimney and fireplace
of a UNknown UNknown
when they killed trevor knight
lot of things e made out of UNknown
the police also found traces of rag paper 25 cotton 75 UNknown
used exclusively by the bureau of engraving
nobody burns money unless you 'r e UNknown rich
or it 's stained with blood
we found the same evidence on the fire tools
along with your fingerprints
your son 's the killer mr
if there 's nothing else
my family and i have done nothing wrong
tell the detectives i 'm filing on mr
we can 't prove he destroyed evidence
i 'm not charging him with destroying evidence
i 'm charging him with willful promotion
of felony gang activity
i 'm doing it because he 's guilty under the law
isn 't that what you always say ?
i actually mean it
i 'm charging him
into testifying against his own son
mr morales if you 'r e wasting this court 's time
with frivolous charges
mr campbell is a member of the moon bay crew
and the people are perfectly willing to offer proof
of his criminal liability
we know the statute ricardo
and sort out whether the people 's charges
warrant a trial
or group of three or more persons
formal or informal
a gang has a common name identifying sign
and members that have engaged in an on going pattern
of criminal gang activity
and UNknown that qualify as criminal gang activity ?
of the UNknown UNknown gang unit
does the moon bay crew qualify as a criminal street gang ?
what is the primary activity of the gangs you UNknown e UNknown
in your 14 years ?
is it drug dealing ?
it 's UNknown is it not ?
correct me if i 'm wrong
but UNknown is still legal in the state of california
i was at the beach
i 'd only moved out from tucson six weeks before
these three boys came up
they were UNknown
one of them his name was carlton
he said they were having a party at his house
with a bunch of other kids
it was this big house up on the hill
what did you do then ?
i went with them to the house
we all started drinking
and people chanting like go go
when i woke up
that i had been raped
did you or anyone call the police ?
i was crying
he said that i should protect myself
he told me how calling the police
would destroy the rest of my life
how rape victims get humiliated
and nobody ever believes them
what did mr
then he drove me to a bus stop
so i could wait for the bus back to long beach
carlton told me what pat scott did to that poor girl
so i went in to talk to her to offer some comfort
i did offer to pay for her medical costs
after all it happened in my house
but i did not bribe or threaten her
well now mr
with your son and his friends to commit a robbery ?
i don 't
i don 't do any of those things and neither does my son
you must recognize this ?
it 's gibberish
in your home why didn 't you report it ?
i had no first hand knowledge
and truthfully it would be up to the girl to report it
since she 's the one who 'd ve to endure the investigation
and your 5 000 convinced her not to
spare us the editorial mr
to a young man named peter markham ?
i UNknown l refresh your memory
this is from the statement given to the police by peter markham
he was assaulted by your son and his friends four months ago
outside a beach cantina in UNknown UNknown
mr markham is from UNknown
he made the mistake of UNknown in UNknown bay
that was a misunderstanding
and the money was for medical expenses
and again criminal charges never UNknown
one has nothing to do with the other
except that you were aware that your son and his friends
were involved in UNknown conduct such as rape
and assault weren 't you ?
i don 't
you UNknown such conduct didn 't you ?
isn 't it a fact your son is 100 financially dependent
on you ?
you pay for his food his housing his car
his UNknown equipment
including charges for spray paint
i don 't keep track of what he buys
but when it comes to keeping strangers out of UNknown bay
when it comes to defending your turf
you and your son 's gang friends are all of one mind
are you not ?
you formed a group called
UNknown UNknown concerned citizens i am correct ?
to organize a neighborhood watch
to petition county government to limit beach access
that 's the prime focus of your group
to keep non residents of UNknown UNknown off the beach ?
off the public beach ?
to keep them off our property
the truth is you don 't really want anybody
who can 't buy into your neighborhood
anywhere near your beach
with their UNknown and their screaming babies
and their 5 beach chairs
you 'r e just trying to make me look like a terrible person
i 'm describing what you are
a thug defending his turf
that gray campbell UNknown in any illegal activity
they failed to show that he is a member of the m b c
failed to show how 186 22 might even possibly apply to him
and why is that ?
because it doesn 't
to stretch the boundaries of the statute
to UNknown an innocent man
the territory they defend through force and UNknown
it 's no different for the moon bay crew
no matter that the turf they defend
is a crescent of water UNknown by UNknown dollar homes
in our state the beach is the great UNknown
everybody 's the same
he drilled that belief into his son
he then UNknown supported his son
as his friends UNknown those who would venture
into their turf
he helped cover it up
when they turned to rape he helped cover that up
he is up to his elbows in their bloody activity
that the people have met the minimum standard
and shown there is sufficient evidence
to take this case to trial
mr campbell will remain free on bond
we are adjourned
because if you don 't
you UNknown l be going to jail with him
or maybe i should just cut a deal with him against you
as a co UNknown in the murder of trevor knight
after all you filled him with so much UNknown
he UNknown another man to death for riding a wave
can he do this ?
you 'r e already part of the gang mr
i came home
trying to burn some things in the fireplace
there was all this money covered in blood
i couldn 't understand how this could UNknown e happened
i just knew i had to fix it
that 's what fathers do
we fix it
we are your honor
with respect to the charge of second degree murder
i hereby sentence carlton campbell
and logan UNknown to a term of 15 years to life
in the state penitentiary
of voluntary manslaughter
in the state penitentiary
when you offered to buy lunch
oh you don 't like the beach ?
UNknown sandwiches lousy parking skin cancer ?
not really my thing
crossing bell rings come on come on come on !
one on one with a train
what did she think that she could beat it ?
to get to the other side
sheriff says we 'r e holding up trains all over the country
the railroad depends on keeping the main line open
we can 't take this back to the garage
yeah well unfortunately his priority is clearing this train from these tracks
you have two hours
suspicious UNknown in town
thanks but you gotta give me some guys
sara 's all you get
all i need
never knew this place existed
the western states historical society
it 's not on a iot of tourist maps
bell stops i had them cut the wires
we need to identify the source of the alarm ray
security company said it was downstairs
the body 's there too
trying to get them to turn some more iights on in here
there are no more iights o 'r UNknown
it 's a UNknown environment
notice how you 'r e not sweating ?
it 's probably 66 degrees in here
35 relative humidity too much light too much heat UNknown the books
the UNknown 's across town
he 's on his way
she looks dead to me
you got first touch
UNknown the skin is UNknown
maybe a blood disease
hey don 't do that
excuse me ?
did he tell you what he was doing here ?
UNknown i wasn 't watching her
i always say good night to veronica because i have to ieave at 8 03 to catch the 8 10 bus
it 's three blocks away
and sometimes the bus comes at 8 08 so i have to rush to catch it
so you went down to the basement to say good night ?
good night veronica
did she walk you to the bus tonight ?
are you coming ?
i have more work to do
then a UNknown pen rolled across the desk fell onto the chair hit the floor and stopped UNknown at the UNknown
then water water falls into her eyes
you mean she was sweating ?
from her forehead
shelley 's frankenstein
she was UNknown ?
mr pratt will you excuse me for a moment ?
i think he 's UNknown
rain man was a UNknown extremely rare
aaron pratt is a high UNknown UNknown man with superior right brain abilities
kinda sounds iike you
man i hate rushing through a crime scene
two years from now no one is gonna care the sheriff turned this into a scoop and run
the call was made above our heads
just document the time in your notes
i 'i i iet you testify on this one
that 's not that far from here
guess i 'i i go caii UNknown control
come on boy
so all you saw was a car trying to beat the signal ?
i 'm putting 55 miles an hour
it 's dark
can 't figure out where
i iooked up and i saw something
i thought it was stopping
i turn my head for one second next thing i know it 's on the tracks
with all due respect we UNknown e got the right of way out here
thanks for your time
i am UNknown evidence
say hello to maverick
as finished as i 'm going to be
you were right
explains the blue face
i found vomit in her throat bloody stool UNknown and some UNknown of the UNknown UNknown on her tongue
i won 't know more tiii i get the blood tests back
could be blood borne disease
i 'm thinking about homicide
then you know more than i do
excuse me sir
i told the officer upstairs
i 'm stanley hunter
with your dust UNknown
it 's one of two volumes in the world
now do you go to the louvre and put your hands all over the raft of the UNknown ?
officer mr hunter would like to give his statement to detective o 'r UNknown
but what i do know is that these are masterpieces
one of a kind
also one of a kind
mr hunter why don 't we go upstairs and talk ?
the good news nick
but there 's no surveillance system
yeah there is
first thing on our iist when we get to the tow yard
one set going forward
the second set of skid marks are darker
more rubber residue
maybe they both are
see old book pages are slightly UNknown
the acid eats away the paper
we UNknown them by a solution
that is slightly basic
it 's aii about UNknown the books
you know not that you could even assign a value but do you have any idea how much each of these books is worth ?
it sold at christie 's for 5 3 miilion
lewis and clark 's UNknown journal sold for 500 000
we have an UNknown UNknown the birds of america which is worth an estimated 300 000
all of that and you never thought about beefing up your security ?
special UNknown are kept in the vault
any rare book removed from the vault gets UNknown through a UNknown
if the book is to be read it 's delivered to a secure room upstairs and if veronica was going to work on it it stayed down here
was this one of the books that veronica was UNknown ?
the author was a british UNknown
it 's worth an estimated 300 000
it 's reaily not a dangerous profession
we got a situation
he 's not weird o 'r UNknown he 's UNknown
but i will wear my heart upon my sleeve for UNknown to peck at
i am not what i am
othello act 1 scene 1 lines 61 and 62
UNknown to UNknown
it 's my favourite shakespeare tragedy
i iike hamlet myself
he 's very concerned with property rights
he tells me the rare books are kept in the vault and they re not allowed off site whispers well mr hunter doesn 't like me
i don 't think the rule was made with you in mind
he breaks the rules all the time
he takes the books home ?
no he eats his iunch in his office
carrots celery tuna on whole wheat
she 's eating and he takes her sandwich and he puts his hand on her breast
and then he puts his tongue UNknown
you know that UNknown you picked up ?
so the UNknown 's from another car ?
well tail lights have different UNknown so yeah
i got a UNknown
maybe her brakes failed
i 'm thinking maybe another vehicle was involved
the engineer didn 't mention a second driver
maybe he didn 't see it
5 minutes before my next post
bottled chemicals from the library ?
is that a iight under there ?
do you have something for me ?
oh your vic ?
what 's on the label is what 's in the bottle
UNknown alcohol 5 per cent UNknown solution UNknown UNknown
when you UNknown the UNknown you UNknown l have a better idea where it came from
10 30 at night ?
his headlights weren 't on
black car headlights off
so he hit her UNknown
accidental or intentional ?
that 's my mail
no d d don 't mix those up
i have two UNknown due tomorrow gas and electric and i have to mail them on my way to work
aaron may i have a glass of water please ?
of course you may
i think he 's incapable of deception nick
we were just UNknown UNknown anxiety
i mean iook around
organised by size
without it he can 't function
i 'i i check out the bedroom
mountain spring water UNknown california
bottled at the source
veronica brought them
we have dinner
UNknown UNknown UNknown
why don 't you think she would date someone like me ?
i have a masters in library science and an english degree from UNknown
and some people like mr hunter treat me like a freak
but veronica didn 't
vic 's hair she was seeing hunter
aaron got jealous
how do you feel about murder ?
yet she must die else she UNknown l betray more men
put out the light and then put out the light
last call on her UNknown was to 911
reel to reel 's already UNknown on my computer
911 what s your emergency ?
try to calm down where are you ?
there s this maniac he s following me train horn
help me please !
yes ma 'a m
help me please !
it doesn 't make any sense
cos there 's something in your victim 's blood that looks like one of those UNknown
no it 's not pulling a UNknown it 's not a chemical
no it 's a iarge ugly UNknown mass
you know it 's probably a UNknown
that 's the largest mass of anything in the body
except organs of course
cart before the horse nick
first you identify it then you figure out where it came from
i always thought you kept your porn in there
uh move it around
composed of two UNknown linked sub units a and b
that i 'm just another pretty face that got to where i am by sleeping with catherine
it 's UNknown
whoa whoa whoa
i was at that crime scene for eight hours man
and iike 48 more to kiii you
what kind of symptoms are we talking about ?
now where did you say this woman worked ?
western states historical society
how does UNknown grab you ?
but it explains the UNknown of the UNknown UNknown on her tongue
so you think she ate the poison ?
i don 't know about ate but the UNknown made contact with her tongue which means you 'r e probably looking for a powder
a day in the iife
and we know this how ?
so she works till six ?
except she doesn 't go home
she runs an errand
there 's only one store in las vegas that makes them
yeah but it happens all the time
the parking spaces are too narrow
and at a premium now that the restaurant moved in
this guy was out of iine
i came out here just to check it out
he said something like
i heard it too
happened right over there
the iast thing this guy needed was coffee
was he a regular ?
double UNknown tall
does mr double UNknown have a name ?
i think it 's croft
works right down the street UNknown
he 's always telling us how to streamline our business
how did megan react to mr croft ?
she told him to go to hell
go to hell !
you 'r e an ass !
and then just drove off
and what about mr croft ?
everyone was just staring at him and then he got in his car and peeled out
UNknown speaking it 's a UNknown not a bean
UNknown is made from the UNknown
castor oil is made from what 's inside
you and the guy who wrote the book
we brought this from his apartment not his office
what makes you think there 's a difference ?
he probably cooked up that UNknown in his kitchen
our guys didn 't find anything there
so he cleans up well
what you 'r e not feeling sorry for this guy now are you ?
hey man he is UNknown
anybody else would be in a cell
yes i UNknown e heard of UNknown
UNknown UNknown UNknown
assassinated by injection with a UNknown pellet shot out of a black umbrella
died two days iater
i found this book in your apartment
what if i also told you that i found your fingerprint on this page ?
but you did touch it
why are you mad at me ?
answer the question
it doesn 't feel right
ever since you killed veronica ?
i loved veronica
like a new bus pass
she said that sometimes the books feel that way after they UNknown e been restored
what did mr hunter say ?
he said get out of my office aaron
i 'm having my lunch !
was mr hunter having iunch with veronica again ?
hard boiled egg celery fruit salad iced tea
veronica was on a diet
she had to iose three pounds
was this iunch different from the other UNknown you told me about ?
teii me what you saw
veronica started crying
he reached in the drawer and pulled out the salt shaker
no sex no food no salt
we 'r e talking about UNknown
the UNknown that killed veronica bradley
you were dating her you ate lunch together opportunity
you mix up a batch of UNknown put it in the shaker
next time you break bread she asks for the salt
normally an eyewitness is the least reliable evidence but here it 's the most reliable
veronica knew about the UNknown
a career UNknown huh stanley ?
for her not for me
she 's the UNknown
he 's the one who came to me
told me about the UNknown
said they felt like his bus pass whatever that means
so i checked it out and he was right
veronica was using me
when she died i thought the problem was solved
tell me again
UNknown pen rolls across the desk falls on the chair hits the floor and stops rolling at the UNknown
then water falls into veronica 's eyes
aaron when you iook at things you see pictures in your mind
tell me the first picture you see
of veronica in this cage
i already told you
tell me what veronica was doing before you said good night
she pulled out a canvas bag
then she iooked around
she was deciding something
thank you aaron
she had about a dozen at her house
plus every known piece of forgery equipment
some people bite their nails she bit her pens
and maybe how she died
get these to greg right away
we need the results of the UNknown UNknown test
i came home straight from work
i don 't know what you 'r e talking about
you want to submit to a iine up ?
a iine up ?
rented this morning
where 's your car ?
i sold it
an accountant who doesn 't keep receipts
hey you don 't know anything about me
i know you UNknown e got a temper
pound it in a body shop a mile from his house
what do you think ?
well this is a lot more than a fender bender sustained contact
get some UNknown
he spilled his coffee
coffee on the outside coffee on the inside
lipstick on the UNknown
croft chases her from the parking lot caught up to her at the light they said their screw you screw UNknown
i think i know the word that made her throw the coffee
i hate that word
she nailed him
she 's got a pursuit on her hands
and she 's the pursued
so she dials 911
oh my god !
but somehow she UNknown him
and she 's still UNknown
all she wants now is to get home
she could have jumped out
not without her dog
i 'i i caii brass
teii him to make the arrest
and you told mr hunter
all you have in this business is your reputation
so veronica tried to save hers but instead of killing mr hunter she ended up killing herself
then must you speak of one that loved not wisely but too well
othello act 5 scene 2 lines UNknown and 344
but othello killed desdemona

the shooting death of a con man at the UNknown
our guys are already there
we 'r e done here brother
i 'm sorry

i gotta go back with the body
sara can you get back to the UNknown and put a rush on this analysis ?

i d say about 50 balloons
the green dye you see here is probably from lime UNknown UNknown
makes them much easier to swallow
he 's a mule
enough petty UNknown and grand UNknown on his record to choke a hippo
don 't say that
what 's the hold up on my pills ?
he didn 't pass me over
coats the stomach and UNknown UNknown
it 's great if you 'r e a mule transporting drugs
our con man 's a mule ?
we found balloons of cocaine in his stomach UNknown
without the pills one bite of a chocolate bar would produce enough UNknown acid to eat away the balloon causing him to od
then he went out and got shot
speaking of which
what 's strange is going into the evidence UNknown after post and finding nothing ieft
don 't make me feel bad for doing my job
if it was your job you couldn t feel bad
well i think i hear some coffee UNknown
what do you want from me ?
i 'm working the case
the case is hot
i have to process it
if you have a problem with that you can clock out now
am i clear ?
where are you going with this ?
her prints are on airline stubs UNknown to tonight 's homicide
there 's got to be more than one ellie brass in the world
ellie rebecca brass ?
UNknown brings in suspects
you 'r e hands off ?
i 'm fine

every serial number
i was the one that told you that
the engraving on ben franklin s collar ?
i don 't see it on this bill
do you ?
excuse me ?
he died overseas somewhere
there was no relationship
he invited me for the weekend
i figured as long as he didn 't chop me up
i 'd have some fun
mind if i smoke ?
no casino UNknown
before he got shot
who 's taking your drug profits ?
man i wish i knew what you were talking about
someone catch you two working on the side ?
i wasn 't even there

i 'm outta here
so long as you 'r e the one doing them
we 'd also like to look at your car
i UNknown it to my boyfriend
what is his name ?
you know you have this whole lenny UNknown thing going on
i 'm not one for brothers but damn !
evidence against her isn 't good
she mules drugs for a guy who ends up dead ten hours later ?
a UNknown chip scam ?
a UNknown alibi ?
if i know my daughter that 's your shooter
brass it 's a big city
boyfriend could disappear
left scope is a government issued 100 bill
right scope is the money from your tourists
it confirms what you saw with the naked eye
on a genuine bill the united states of america is written in UNknown letters on the border of ben franklin s portrait
on the UNknown bill the UNknown script is blurred out
what about UNknown ?
they are on the bill on your left
so the numbers on the right didn t hold the green ink
no printer on the market can make a true green
blue and yellow UNknown always bleed in
our UNknown system depends on it
who do we notify ?
the treasury ?
i UNknown l put these back in the evidence room
wait till the UNknown find out what we do with counterfeit money
so you gave up your drugs to your boss huh ?
only if i eat
you see the thing with me is i 'm mind over matter
i can imagine a hamburger and i 'm full
will you fill me up UNknown ?
i don 't think i can handle this
i gotta call UNknown
i heard it bro a but in there
you know how UNknown is
if you ask him for the keys to the car he 's gonna ask you if you UNknown e done your homework
it 's iike a multiple choice question
you know ?
you think you 'r e my only friend in the UNknown ?
i 'm just teiling you to be careful
am i supposed to hold my breath and count to ten ?
look i 'm on the job
it 's standard police work
don 't worry i won 't
in pursuit of a UNknown 8 red UNknown
suspect wanted for questioning
which one 's keith driscoll ?
i was just hitchhiking
what are you and ellie into ?
what do you mean ?
you got her UNknown drugs from mexico
you got her mixed up in a homicide
you got it backwards man
she turned me on to coke so i could stud for her
you can 't just shoot me man
he pulled his gun
we wanna question you about the murder of vincent avery
i 'm not riding with him
you 'r e right you 'r e not
what do you mean you can 't give it back ?
it 's all we have for our vacation
well it 's counterfeit
the attendant said the hundred i had was phoney
so i went to our branch bank here and i tried to exchange it but they couldn t do it
i mean why would anybody turn in bad money if they can 't get UNknown for it ?
because it 's in violation of title 18 section 473 of the united states code punishable by up to 15 years for UNknown passing on bad money
oh my god !
do you have a 20 bill ?
our UNknown are up in the room
i may have something

the void on the one to one matches the void on ellie 's left rear tyre
it puts the car at the scene of avery 's murder iess than 12 hours ago

the tickets were bought with your credit card but we have no proof he ever went down there
he 's generous till avery made him mad

no but it did get me thinking
if something doesn 't feel right it probably isn 't
take a iook
see the serial numbers ?
each one is different
this couple didn 't make one bill and run 00 copies with the same serial number
they had to burn separate plates for each number
much harder to catch

i went on the t department UNknown
they UNknown e each done time for fraud
and yes high end UNknown
you federal guys are sneaky

the back of the grip
UNknown get their hands pinched in the slide
i need you to show me your hands

what if vincent avery wasn 't murdered ?
however in iight of unpredictable events the sting stiii UNknown
it came to you and you didn 't take
you should be very proud
it never feels right when it works
only feels wrong when it doesn 't
first i have the saliva sample taken from captain brass 's badge
better known as ellie 's dna
take a good iook at her UNknown
second blood sample from jim brass
they 'r e nothing alike
from parent to child seven of thirteen UNknown should match up
i don 't have UNknown 's mother 's dna on file
but my guess is
not brass 's
you still got a shooter out there
with a pinch on his hand
when the three of you got back from UNknown
you UNknown the captain
this a joke ?
i think i kiiled him
what about ellie ?
can we get a medic ?
that 's it
what is it rick ?
we were checking out the blood from your gun
we compared your dna to her dna
she 's not
i 'm a detective

UNknown your face is like no other the earth has ever seen
what need have you of words ?
your eyes are UNknown greater
there is no need for words if your soul is singing

to theatre anywhere

i do not know what i can offer you
oh take her
no that 's not it
where can i find death ?
what didn 't you find ?
you have never shown me your pictures but i am sure this is all something trivial
why should you want to go searching for something and getting upset ?
there is an interesting piece of news
the famous ballerina UNknown UNknown is on tour in the town

she has made her reputation as the dying swan and that is what she will dance tomorrow
the dying swan
UNknown UNknown UNknown UNknown
i have found what i have been searching for all my life
all my life i have been searching for death and i have found it in your dance
UNknown if you would permit me to draw you it would be a miracle of art
i beseech you
you may get dressed in that room
you are pretty !
how good it is that you cannot speak
i do not know if i exist at all or whether i am in delirium
the most sublime thing in the world is peace and the most sublime peace is in death
i have UNknown it !
UNknown rocco herself is posing for me

i shall show you my work and you will see it is a work of genius
but it is UNknown terrible

life is more terrible than death
there is no need to be afraid
i too like you was beautiful
i died UNknown here
the first tour by the famous dancer UNknown UNknown was an enormous and fully deserved success
one more sitting and you will see yourself signorina in all your brilliance
i love you !
signor UNknown UNknown
can this be the same UNknown ?
where are those UNknown sad exhausted eyes ?
now her eyes blaze with a different flame
no no it is not the same UNknown
well let us begin
that won 't do at all !
be still UNknown do not move
that is where beauty and peace lie
f i n
no apparent injuries but has a black rash on the chest and arms
any available er please respond
don 't tell me the obvious
i can see that
whose fault was it ?
he tried to get out of bed
you must stay put
i called out for help many times but nobody came
i thought i 'd wet the bed
i 'm not avoiding you
i UNknown l send the cash next week i promise
please understand it 's a tough time
no i 'm not being cold
i do love our daughter
i think of her more than you
there you are dr UNknown
the boy with high fever is waiting to see you
is it my turn yet ?
i UNknown e been here forever
i told you please be patient
is it my turn yet ?
my head is spinning
he 's in critical condition
thank you very much
they are late paying us again
i spoke with them this morning
you 'r e being paid
it 's for a nurse
where are they ?
the hospital makes a fortune and we can finally get paid !
it may affect his brain
he needs immediate care
what is going on ?
the generator is UNknown and unstable
blood bags drips UNknown we only have a few of each left
as for drugs
nine nurses have quit these past two weeks
it 's clear that our operation is in trouble
everyone is avoiding us now
let 's just do our best
is that your solution ?
my nurses are working non stop
because we 'r e UNknown we put patients into shared rooms and we risk cross infection
it needs to be discussed
keys to the drug cabinet please
you must force some patients home
i know better than anyone
where does it hurt ?
my chest it really hurts
can you bear it ?
can 't you help me ?
it 's too late for surgery huh ?
don 't say that
i don 't mind
i don 't care what the odds are
don 't be like that
let 's be strong together
how long have you felt dizzy ?
maybe it 's nothing but i don 't remember
when i woke up
i woke up face down
did you hit your head ?
why didn 't we realize ?
how long has he been here ?
he didn 't tell us
call dr akiba now !
i 'm so sorry
when you call us we can come right away
you 'r e new
i can do it
he 's not your guinea pig
if he were conscious you 'd be in trouble
practice on yourself if you must
cerebral UNknown hemorrhage sub UNknown UNknown no voluntary respiration
it 's up to you
i UNknown l check on the UNknown
come here everyone
grandma don 't hide
hold out your hands
what are you doing ?
UNknown this cut
but i 'm a surgeon too !
how dare you !
don 't call yourself a surgeon
please let me do it
i can do UNknown
that 's the extent of your ambition
you don 't deserve to practice
wake me up in three hours
i UNknown l take a nap in room five
i can do it
any er respond please
can 't take him sorry
he needs a well equipped hospital
i understand but
can you pick up the glasses ?
do you recognize this ?
you do don 't you ?
you 'r e all there
i 'm sorry
you made dinner
it 's a mystery why they appear there but the phenomenon itself is well known
ever wonder how come red is always the same color ?
in the sunlight or beneath a lamp it looks the same right ?
that 's proof that our brains are creating the color
a lot of what we see is actually a product of our mental process
if brain UNknown is altered memories can begin to move again
you can let her look at mirrors just don 't let her have one
if it broke it might upset her
probably from another patient
working late ?
who does he think he is ?
buying new equipment but not hiring technicians
leaving UNknown half done
don 't tell anyone but i haven 't heard from the director since yesterday
we have no reason to stay here but we can 't abandon the patients
many of them can 't be transferred
they should be in UNknown care
let 's divide them up
iook for places that UNknown l take them
lf we can just get through tonight
i 'm so bad with a syringe
we don 't have enough !
room three ?
i said no !
we 'r e too short UNknown
he 's covered in a rash maybe UNknown
exactly so we
but we can 't quarantine him
don 't you care what happens ?
as a doctor you don 't care if he dies ?
where is he ?
call dr akiba
get them both
if he dies en route to somewhere else
i have to report this hospital
ok i get it
that 's all we can do
room three he 's UNknown fast
room three ?
blood pressure is below seventy
UNknown drip five gamma units
what happened ?
get her out of here
here 's the UNknown
so cardiac massage
what did you use ?
you said calcium UNknown
no his blood chemistry is ruined
i UNknown l open him up
it 's my fault ?
i killed him ?
did i kill him ?
but the doctor said UNknown
there must be a report
it was a medical mistake
i don 't recall what i ordered
but the proof is right there
i take full responsibility
even so immediate cause of death was UNknown
suppose we 'd found him later ?
there 'd be no way of saving him
one moment dr UNknown
why be a slave to the truth ?
we did all we could for him for three months
a situation developed and things just turned for the worst
is that it ?
in a life or death situation it was a small mistake
doctor he was your patient
you were entrusted with his life
he had burns over seventy percent of his body
if he had returned to consciousness what kind of life would he have had ?
if i 'd just stopped to think
in any case i UNknown l do what must be done
what happens if dr akiba has to quit ?
as things are if this place is reported what will become of the patients ?
it doesn 't justify a false report
we UNknown l all lose our jobs
and what if it gets into the media ?
it UNknown l follow all of us
we UNknown l be UNknown
chief he never had a single visitor
no friends no family no one
no one can recognize him right ?
as he UNknown the chemical will UNknown
the burns messed up his chemistry anyway
so no one could know ?
if someone ran an analysis in the next 48 hours but who would doubt us if we all sign the certificate ?
it won 't be family that picks him up
the health department will take him
there might be an official autopsy
complete cell breakdown will take two days
we can 't wait that long
we must tell the authorities today
let 's heat him up
speed the decay
so he UNknown faster
dr UNknown is sleeping in five
UNknown is in five ?
this is room three
put him in room one and warm him up
four hours will do it
erase the UNknown memory
don 't let him decay too far
we UNknown l take turns
i UNknown l stay
i UNknown e always felt you were
it 's ok
how long since you graduated ?
how old are you ?
i 'm twenty three
trying does nothing
see i can do it
whose patient is that in the er ?
i told the UNknown no but
doctor i thought you 'd gone home
i fell fast asleep in one of the wards
a ward ?
i checked on him got sleepy then crashed out
anything wrong ?
i 'm anxious for you to see him
UNknown of the internal organs
he smiled right at me
we could be pioneers
let 's call disease control
really akiba ?
ms UNknown call UNknown
unconscious though he was he fell out of bed
why do you think that was ?
because you hurt him
that 's not true
that 's not right !
you heard everything in room three right ?
but make no mistake you were the one who caused his death
what the hell is that ?
he looked right through me and smiled
akiba what do we do ?
we study it
you want to spend your entire career here ?
a once in a lifetime chance
if we discover the UNknown it will carry our names forever
offers and research grants will pour in
let 's do it
you can 't ask me to touch that
i feel the same but we have no choice
he was in room four
dr UNknown was next door
i don 't know what he heard
he says he was asleep
it UNknown l take three more hours in room one
let 's buy time
are you decided ?
i want a cell culture
nurse i put him on a monitor
keep an eye on him
what 's up ?
you 'r e there aren 't you ?
maybe he just escaped
i don 't think so
we must consider everything
it 's not much that 's for sure
find something ?
think we UNknown l find it ?
is it crawling around somewhere ?
it 's not medically possible
no it 's not
did we really see it ?
do you really believe it ?
what do you mean ?
we were shocked confused
like seeing a face in the clouds
we saw it !
it was human
i tell them but they still throw them out
we UNknown e got to save more of them
it 's such a waste
nurse they 'r e from the UNknown patient
nurse what 's wrong ?
what 's wrong ?
cold water quick !
we must contain it
where then ?
what 's wrong ?
she 's got a fever
we must treat her
now we know it 's strong enough to spread
what can we do ?
we should hurry
what happened to her ?
what on earth ?
please tell me what 's going on ?
i can 't talk now
later maybe when room one is cleared up
i have a right to know !
what infection ?
then she can 't be the UNknown host
let 's find the other guy
what do you mean host ?
you saw what it did
enough is enough
now it 's spreading
stop messing around
what are you doing ?
every vein in the body
slow at everything ?
i had terrible asthma
i wanted to be just like them
is that bad ?
even a slow girl like me ?
i didn 't mean it like that
no UNknown skill so i stuck him over and over
over and over
you can 't take back what 's been said
want me to practice ?
then i will
how on earth can you tell ?
it 's the same symptoms
what symptoms ?
we don 't know it 's airborne
the UNknown patient in room four is UNknown
use your brains
but it UNknown people
what if it doesn 't need a host ?
cells live for a few hours after death
imagine it uses this to UNknown the body
dr UNknown do you have any proof of that ?
why are you so concerned with the UNknown ?
i told you to be a pioneer
i 'm sick of this
the same symptoms
if we don 't solve it in an hour we call for help
they UNknown l only seal off the hospital
they won 't help us
no one exits until they identify it
we 'd just wait to die
then i UNknown l leave now
you mean run ?
young man if you leave now will you ever stop running ?
we should all get our stories straight concerning ourselves
if you won 't regret it go
it 's up to you
fine by me
wanted to quit anyway
you 'r e UNknown as a doctor and as a human being
therefore you UNknown l never be a good doctor
no love for your patients
visiting hours are over
i can make it
which room ?
where 's my son ?
i UNknown e not been to visit for ages
i 'd like to see him soon
your son 's symptoms
is that so ?
a visitor left it for us
i 'm ok
give me something
then you UNknown l know how it feels
they say we 'r e judged at the end of our days
so why are you punishing me now ?
what are you talking about ?
i can 't change anything
you run away then
you should try having a little love for your patients
how dare you ?
they were worn out from nursing you so i
you couldn 't cure me so you wanted me out of the hospital
no that 's not it
you didn 't react
it was agony when my heart stopped
i always had faith you 'd cure me some day
i 'm so sorry
UNknown what 's up ?
who are you talking to ?
i 'm sorry
when you killed me so easily ?
i 'm so sorry
a doctor 's job isn 't just about UNknown life
release him from his pain
i UNknown e got to get out of here now
i UNknown your blood
dr UNknown get out of here
the infection is everywhere
don 't worry
do you know something ?
what 's your secret ?
what is this infection ?
did you spread the virus ?
vaccinated yourself to watch the infection spread ?
i didn 't do that
what do you mean ?
you forgot ?
i was nearby
i certainly wasn 't sleeping
i was wide awake
are you punishing us ?
is that what you mean ?
it was an accident
all of us die sometime
it 's what happened next
this virus isn 't airborne at all
it spreads through the mind
the mind ?
don 't talk nonsense
you were UNknown your time
our mistake gave you the chance
you 'r e insane
who are you to criticize us ?
it was dr UNknown

we want to know why did you write action on your shift record ?
i can prove that you have killed four persons
why did you kill one after one ?
because killing the first one was too cruel
it was not perfect

so you bought the UNknown books
he also bought scalpel to kill people
why did you kill people on rainy days ?
because i feel excited
so troublesome !
all you killed are bad women

did you have special feeling to this student ?
she was pure and innocent
what will you do after graduation ?
i want to be a kindergarten teacher
it is so happy when i am with kids
teacher is good
why did you look at me like that ?
because i think you are pure and innocent
what did you say ?
don 't be scared
i don 't understand what you have said
i hate the dirty people
in this world it is hard to find a pure girl like you
stop the car
don 't be scared
don 't be afraid
i don 't have a evil mind

i want to get back my photos and video UNknown
i am sorry

i just wish i had a fucking UNknown
are you kidding me ?
that 's why you 'r e going to go back out into this mess and shoot something
you fucking film it
got great tape !
a world exclusive
no i just read there 's supposed to still be over 500 000 un UNknown land mines in this country
you know the last time i was here there was a sniper UNknown right there taking UNknown at my ass
five year anniversary
duck you should talk to some of your old contacts and work with benjamin
i want to do something on the reconciliation
you know muslim and UNknown widow sort of thing
first overseas assignment producing a piece on something you seem to know very little about could be pretty damn funny
yeah franklin and my father thought this would be a good first foreign assignment for me
you know get my feet wet
and whose kid are you again ?
the network vice president 's
it was hell
and his expense account
oh brady you look great
good to see you man
you look like shit mate
so does your mama
it 's fucking destroyed him
two UNknown please
all y 'a ll look like y 'a ll need a bath
your first time and you 'r e traveling with duck ?
i hope you brought your flak jacket
last UNknown who traveled with him lost one of his balls
it 's true
he attracts mortar fire like shit attracts flies
it 's insane
there 's no way this country is going to get its economy back up until it starts catching some of these assholes
until they catch the fox
now that would be a great story
where 's that UNknown war book you UNknown e been reading ?
during the war he ordered the rape and murder of thousands of innocent UNknown
there 's a 5 million bounty on his little arrogant head
cla and UNknown and every bounty hunter from here to chuck norris
looking for him
it 's good
there 's an old UNknown saying that when a bottle of this stuff is on the table the devil 's sitting in the corner laughing
you know what i was just thinking of ?
if every day is a holiday at the holiday inn
that 's not your room
what do they do about christmas time ?
look man if i don 't see you at breakfast
i 'm going to have UNknown send a task force to search for you
get over here
but you 'r e okay ?
i hope you don 't mind
i raided your honor bar over there
UNknown a few of your little bottles of vodka
so what else is new ?
i watched you guys today doing your report up on a bridge
franklin 's not looking half bad
he have some work done ?
you know old times sake
i 'm going to sell it to the germans or UNknown
don 't worry about it
don 't worry duck
i got something duck
something that could put me right back on the map
i thought you might be interested
but i 'm meeting this girl in greece the day after tomorrow and it 's just not something i can cancel you know ?
just shitty timing
look but i UNknown l still do your stand up tomorrow
what already ?
peace especially in UNknown and UNknown UNknown
that 's fine with me if you wanna piggyback with us
i got no hard feelings
oh thank you
oh you can 't afford him
hell i could hardly afford him
benjamin meet simon hunt a former star with our network
simon benjamin strauss
you know i thought you were dead too
reporting from the five year anniversary ceremony for UNknown television this is simon hunt in UNknown
reporting for UNknown state television
i 'm simon hunt in UNknown
reporting for the polish television news network
i 'm simon hunt in UNknown
i hope one of these bastards buys this
yeah well considering what i got up my sleeve it won 't matter much
hey get this back to the hotel
i UNknown l meet you there later
all right daddy what 's the story ?
you make the call ?
what call ?
cause this story 's too big to waste if you 'r e just going to get on a plane like UNknown franklin
you 'r e getting soft UNknown
you UNknown e gotten real soft around the edges
you 'r e like a racehorse that 's been put out to pasture
yeah and you can fuck off simon
but when i know that you 'r e ready to do serious journalism instead of that UNknown fluff they UNknown e reduced you to
i UNknown l fill you in okay ?
what 's the story you motherfucker ?
it 's good
pompous bastard who 's responsible for all of this ?
so this great source of yours knows where he 's hiding just like that ?
have you thought about that ?
we can get right up to him
i know the town
i don 't think they have UNknown UNknown in UNknown UNknown
how do you even know that you can trust him ?
it 's real
you go one step over the border UNknown can 't catch you
no no no
he 's there
he 's there !
he 's surrounded by sympathetic UNknown UNknown who will protect him at all costs
that 's just fucking great
we 'r e leaving first thing in the morning
if you could see me in this bikini duck you wouldn 't be doing this
oh well i can wait
but i don 't know for how long
you 'r e torturing me
hey look i know i 'm new and green and a joke to you but i just graduated from harvard okay ?
and i know something 's up
i haven 't the slightest idea what you 'r e talking about
oh come on
me and simon are just hanging out
i saw your girlfriend when she came by the office two weeks ago
she is hotter than hot
you don 't leave her in greece to hang out
you been listening to my conversations ?
i want in on it
i know there 's a story
what is up with this harvard shit ?
you know i dated a girl from harvard once and she wasn 't so fucking bright
look my father is a cold mean son of a bitch and he thinks i 'm soft and weak and not quite cut out for this type of work
and there 's no way on god 's green earth i 'm going to prove that to him by letting you get a great story without me
how do you know it 's so great ?
you 'r e hanging out with a guy who had a fucking UNknown on national television and is a punch line in the business
if it wasn 't good you wouldn 't be doing it
look at you
you see his main bodyguard is this psychopathic little fuck named UNknown
he had a real UNknown for UNknown and UNknown these very young muslim girls as he was UNknown cleansing the villages
shit the good part benjamin is this UNknown the guy in charge of protecting the fox he 's got this tattoo on his forehead that reads in UNknown
i was dead the day i was born
they teach that evil shit at harvard ?
now we are headed right into the heart of this UNknown madness into UNknown territory
the fox is their god
people protect their god
let 's go find us some war criminals
20 24 hours ago
yeah it looks like uh a ski lift
84 winter olympics was held right here in UNknown
eight years later the fox used this area as a staging ground for his snipers
won the gold medal triple UNknown
best all around scumbag
so it 's going to be like that huh ?
20 20 24 hours a day
so what is your master plan ?
you have a contact when we get to this town ?
i 'm just going to start knocking on doors
you see that ?
we UNknown e entered UNknown UNknown
that quickly ?
are we going to be okay here ?
who the hell knows ?
but 5 million is 5 million and i 'm not stopping
5 million ?
wait wait wait wait
he may be thinking it but it ain 't going to happen
don 't be so sure
don 't be so stupid
after this interview 's finished everything 's in play my friends
one time in UNknown
three days later he was in morocco getting a massage from a hooker named gladys
simon has his whims but this one i am not supporting
this isn 't a whim
you know what this means to me
okay we are journalists
it would be a pleasure to personally catch him
if i gave you a gun would you know how to use it ?
i told you
do we know any actual facts at all guys ?
he 's so afraid of getting caught that he 's grown his hair out and has a full orthodox beard
funny cause i heard he actually shaved his head
he 's bald as a UNknown
now what we do know is that the fox drives in a convoy of orange cars
all right ?
that 's funny simon
well then we should keep an eye out for that too
yeah that 's great
why don 't we stop each one ?
hey knock knock
one second he 's UNknown himself
cause he 's afraid we might actually run into the fox the next he 's complaining cause we probably won 't
no i 'm not
he is not desperate
he is everywhere
and if you get close to the fox if you corner him then even god can 't help you
what the fuck was that about ?
a little warning
actually it was the first time that i thought that maybe simon wasn 't jerking our chain
well that 's a possibility too
oh my god
every single person out here knows exactly what we 'r e doing
keep your panties dry benjamin
it had nothing to do with the fox
what the hell do you mean ?
it 's just a little local tradition to shoot at every customer ?
wait a minute
you mean the money i left on the table ?
that 's mine ?
i needed it more
i didn 't know he was going to shoot at us
a little taste of what you left behind ?
don 't say you didn 't
now the town 's a hundred percent UNknown UNknown
no UNknown left
nice UNknown right ?
what does the UNknown say ?
it says don 't touch him
you don 't ?
i could always UNknown it
miriam is the UNknown working again ?
word has it there 's a bunch of them living right here in UNknown
but it wouldn 't be much hunting
i mean most of them are listed right in the phone book
as i said we 'r e not authorized to arrest war criminals
you are the international police right ?
i thought the un was looking for war criminals
but you said you don 't have an indictment list
we don 't
you see it 's the un that are looking for war criminals not the un police task force
no not the ones who could actually catch them
well that 's one way of looking at it
sounds like the usual un jerk off to me
you got any milk ?
look we 'r e headed up to UNknown now
we just figured we 'd stop in and register with you just in case we got killed or something like that
well consider yourselves registered
is there any word on what 's going up there now ?
from UNknown ?
jesus fucking christ
i mean he 's actually up there
i can 't fucking believe this
why would they tell them not to go up there ?
tell them not to go up there because i don 't want them walking into a UNknown
now really tell me the truth
who the fuck are you guys ?
i told you we are journalists
what you think we 'r e just posing as journalists ?
do you like beer ?
i like beer
let 's get a beer
for a group of un guards to go it 's too dangerous
for you guys ?
i 'm sorry are you still insinuating we 'r e a cla hit squad or something ?
i 'm sorry are you still insinuating you 'r e journalists ?
i UNknown e been waiting for you
certain things need to be taken care of professionally right ?
took me months
that 's how i know you didn 't just stumble on the fact he 's up in UNknown
well it 's been printed in the press
so has the UNknown
you 'r e not making any sense now
and fact is the united nations
they would be happy if he killed all the UNknown
save them all this money and energy
john major and the british backed the fox even though they would never publicly admit it
and the americans
the whole fucking thing is dirty
but in dirty times dirty deeds need to be done right ?
one arm of the government said it would do something does nothing
that would be us
i mean look at you guys
do you really think you 'r e fooling anyone ?
he thinks we 'r e a hit squad
he thinks we 'r e a fucking hit squad !
yeah this can 't be good
isn 't it illegal impersonating a cla officer ?
yeah but we denied it
yeah he didn 't believe it
it 's true
yeah the problem is if you were cla you would deny it
and if you weren 't you would also deny it
actually he 's not that far off the mark you know ?
i mean we 'r e not cla but we can do a lot more than just interview the fox
it 's not a UNknown
not a UNknown not a whim
but we are not capturing him
i mean look at us
that 's not what we do
i 'm checking into that hotel down the road
i 'm taking a shower a shit and a UNknown
tomorrow morning i 'm getting up
i 'm driving up that mountain to UNknown and i am finding the fox
now you 'r e welcome to join me UNknown or you 'r e welcome to fuck off
i mean just trying to get an interview is crazy
but we 'r e not UNknown
yeah well i 'm supposed to be on fucking vacation
and it makes sense why he had a UNknown on air
he 's a goddamn nut job
yeah simon is a goddamn nut job but his UNknown wasn 't for nothing
we 'd seen some horrible stuff that day
yeah reporters see horrible things all the time
that 's what they do
he was drunk high
he lost it then and he 's losing it now
there was these two girls right ?
named UNknown and una
we used to hang out together from time to time
who the hell knows why they were there
it was war
they were our friends
simon and UNknown they had a little thing
hell it was more than a little thing
simon he liked her
whatever little money he had he gave her
they didn 't spend that much time together
but it was war how can you ?
but simon in his own little crazy way he loved her
now you fast forward six months
UNknown 's under siege worse than ever
and we haven 't heard from UNknown or her cousin for months now
and only thing we knew was that UNknown had gone back to UNknown to help out her mother
and then one day we hear about a serious incident in UNknown and we go there to cover it
the horrors we saw
we just got ready to do our job cover our story
and then there she was
twenty minutes before we went on the air
they had shot her in her stomach five times
so don 't believe everything that you learn in journalism school
cause in war what you see and what really happened are sometimes two very different things
oh my god !
they 'r e watching every car that goes up this mountain
hold on boys
wait hold on
you are out of your mind
be thankful that there aren 't 50 UNknown pointed at our heads
so what are you going to do ?
i 'm going to do what any good journalist would do when he gets to a new place
doesn 't exactly look like they get many newcomers in here
just keep smiling
what did he say ?
he said you 'r e about skinny enough to be used as bait
what happened to the 20 i gave you yesterday ?
simon save some for me
what is he saying ?
he just sold you and me out
thank you simon
do you really think the people of UNknown UNknown are that weak ?
we don 't go university like you people do
but we are not dumb and we don 't like to be made fun of
we are not making fun of you
okay we don 't want any trouble
you know how i got these animals on wall ?
i shoot them
yes i think so
i mean uh he got his nickname because he loved to hunt foxes
you obviously love to hunt foxes
i was just wondering
the war is over
for fuck 's sake simon
you are one brave motherfucker
you tell your friends that we know nothing here
tell them that we lost loved ones in the war too
not just the UNknown
or at least i do my best
what do you mean you saw his cars ?
while you were back there being a complete fucking asshole
benjamin saw them out the door
back down the mountain
i don 't know
fuck these roads !
so does my dick
you got three cars that 's full of them !
yeah i 'm going to call the un or UNknown or someone
no fucking calls
no calls !
no we 'r e just tourists on our way to UNknown
yeah get out of the fucking car now !
oh my god
on the ground !
just don 't panic
shut the fuck up !
on the ground now !
we 'r e just journalists !
you do not have
how are you ?
we almost kill you man
yeah no shit
but if you do call first us okay ?
whatever you do don 't stare at the midget
what midget ?
they run stuff that comes in through UNknown
beautiful guitar it 's yours
fucking greedy midget
i UNknown l pay you both back
UNknown can you turn down the UNknown please ?
no no more champagne
who is UNknown and lola ?
look baby i can hardly hear you
the connection 's horrible
it 's better than running over the midget
and how 'd you know ?
we 'r e not talking
well it looks like we 'r e talking
things are heating up
look i 'm between places right now
i needed a bath
you 'r e broke
i dream about catching him
wiping that arrogant smile off his face
my whole fucking situation every bad thing that 's ever happened to me stems from that bastard
i was flying high before that war
finding him would UNknown e been so fucking brilliant
maybe you should call your source again
you are un fucking believable
i heard rumors that the fox was up in UNknown
i thought if i had a source it 'd push you over to joining me so
you know i must be a fucking idiot
no i 'm an asshole
no all this time you UNknown e been making fun of my life in new york
joking about how i 'm not the man that i used to be ?
let me share something with you simon
you 'r e not the man you used to be either
you are far fucking from it
dry your dick off and get the fuck outta my room
lady do you
boris the un guy he thought we were right on his trail
yeah well he still does
what do you mean ?
i just saw him in the lobby and he wants to meet his favorite cla hit squad at that burnt out tunnel in UNknown tonight
he said things are heating up
he did ?
why the hell didn 't you tell me ?
we got to get going !
so at what point do we get jumped and killed ?
i 'm not doing what i 'm doing
i mean clearly i 'm doing this but i 'm not doing this because if i was doing this i could get into a lot of trouble for doing it
what the fuck boris ?
the person i spoke to about your mission
right at the start of the war they got some girls from my school
look it was shitty on all sides okay ?
you don 't know shitty until you UNknown e been gang raped for seven hours
where 's boris ?
i am and always will be a proud UNknown
this is about money
made us money
wanted what we had
use that money to protect him
but they killed my father
and now we have nothing
i hate nothing
what do we get ?
what you came to UNknown to get
and how do we do that ?
my old boyfriend he is one of his guards
i have no interest in him anymore but i still talk to him because i know one day the cla will come to my home
how many guards ?
three of you is thirty of them
they are fat and lazy and bored out of their minds in the countryside
and you know exactly where he is ?
i risk everything talking to you
we just can 't
if you guys are not serious forget it
the agency has strict rules
we 'r e not authorized for payments
others in the company are but not us
weaker divisions are
you know who we are
you know our reputations and our accuracy in UNknown our goals around the world
a single bullet from us can end wars or start them
right now you 'r e standing in the way of us UNknown those goals
you can help us and you UNknown l no longer be UNknown our operation
you can ignore us and i cannot guarantee your safety
the agency is i 'm afraid to say completely UNknown about these issues
i didn 't think you had it in you !
that 's the UNknown fucking thing i UNknown e ever seen in my life
you 'r e a madman
i think she 's just full of shit and trying to play us but it 's better to find out for sure
i don 't know what we got into here gentlemen but i fucking love it
you know when you think about it the whole thing is fucking ridiculous
you can 't even spell cla
every fucking cla guy i know looks exactly like me
yeah only better looking
and that is the genius of it
the cla would have someone who doesn 't look cla
what part of i think we 'r e being followed do you not understand ?
who could it be ?
jesus fucking hell !
yeah no shit
we 'r e not heading toward UNknown
we 'r e heading toward pale
oh god damn it !
it 's where the fox lived during the war
it 's just UNknown country
because my old friend putting your life in danger is actual living
the rest is television
we got to be extra careful
don 't talk to anyone in the hotel
don 't talk on a cell phone
that won 't be a problem
trust me guys trust me
we have stepped into something here
people are worried
who the fuck is that guy listening to us ?
nobody 's listening to us !
what we got to be afraid of the hotel help now ?
are you sleeping in my room ?
but we 'r e no closer to finding the fox than anybody else
i mean boris is a nut
UNknown 's a con artist
and that guy following us on the road is just some drunk or your little midget friend wanting to wrestle
you were saying ?
fucking don 't move
well now fox want to find you
i 'm sorry
i 'm sorry i don 't understand !
i don 't speak your language !
i don 't know what you 'r e saying !
i don 't know what you 'r e saying !
i don 't know what he 's saying !
we are not cla
we are not cla !
we are journalists !
i don 't understand what you 'r e saying !
we are not cla !
don 't !
stop it !
what mix up ?
no we 'r e not cla
we 'r e really not c
the cla is coming for me
we hear everything
we 'r e just journalists
but you tell others that you are cla
we didn 't say anything
you said to boris
he was just really confused
we 'r e really just journalists
and we 'r e not here to hurt you
you can 't do it
he 's out the back !
move in !
we are UNknown
you ever heard of freedom of the press ?
not in UNknown sir no
hey excuse me
that 's classified information
he was right fucking there !
just what are you insinuating ?
i was an inch an inch from this guy !
he was there !
we did our job
i was nose to nose with the most wanted fugitive in the world
let me tell you something mr cunt
arrested for what ?
but before he was suddenly transferred to darkest africa to never be heard from again we confronted him about your little representation
if i ever hear from you again the cla will be on you like a cheap suit from the men 's UNknown
you UNknown l be arrested jailed and UNknown by a big dumb large cocked UNknown bastard for the rest of your shitty little lives
i assume that i can quote you on the squirrel remark
we do the things that people don 't need to know about
it 's a part we deny even exists
it 's a part of the cla that 's been working for the last three weeks in UNknown on the fox
and what have you been working on doing letting him disappear ?
let me ask you a question
why do you think the cla would want to let a war criminal go ?
let me ask you a question
i suggest you use it
we 'r e not saving your asses again
from this moment on the story 's being written by others
you won 't have feeling in your ass for a week
so what are you going to do ?
i don 't know
share some UNknown with him and his girlfriend
they 'r e sending us away because we found him
no he found us
no it 's like no one in a position of power in this place even wants to try and catch that bastard
and that 's just wrong
i 'm saying we can 't leave
i think i just wet myself
there ain 't no team you motherfucker
it 's just us
united states currency
you turn me in and then what ?
they are more afraid of me than i am of them
you do not have the balls to kill me
and you do not have the balls to take my money
and you do not have the balls to see what the international community will do or not do to me
you have nothing
if the power comes back on it still doesn 't mean you can leave
i 'm never leaving
this was UNknown 's town
it 's one of the few places UNknown came back to
they UNknown l know best what to do with him
let me borrow 50 bucks
you want to borrow 50 bucks ?
actually make it a hundred
you know when all this hits it 's going to be a shit storm of international denial and cover ups
maybe you could talk to your father get me that gig to report it
then i can pay you back
you going to stay and cover it ?
are you ?
the girl in greece
just play something decent on this will you ?
for once ?
and that 's why you love me
that 's why i love you
i live on the edge
nice work dumb ass
not an ideal location
i 'm saying this is an ass UNknown day
we all know what day it is
a glorious day for all the proud members of the allied planets
UNknown day !
what month is it ?
six years today the alliance sent the UNknown runnin UNknown their pants
you know your coat is kind of a UNknown color
it was on sale
and i 'm thinking you weren 't UNknown with an UNknown of schooling
so why don 't we just ignore each other till we go away ?
the UNknown were a bunch of cowardly UNknown piss pots
should UNknown e been killed off of every world UNknown
say that to my face
i said you 'r e a coward and a piss pot
now what are you gonna do about it ?
drunks are so cute
best o luck though
grand entrance would not go amiss
is UNknown even awake ?
this is why we lost you know
i 'm thinkin somebody needs to put you down dog
what do you think ?
i 'm thinkin we UNknown l rise again
every man there go back inside or we will blow a new crater in this little moon
damn yokels can 't even tell a transport ship ain 't got no guns on it
blow a new crater in this moon
my thanks wash
they 'r e fine
wha i didn 't start it
i just wanted a quiet drink
funny sir how you always seem to find yourself in an alliance friendly bar come u day
looking for a quiet drink
see this is another sign of your tragic space dementia all paranoid and UNknown breaks the heart
did we at least make a contact ?
ladies and UNknown we have ourselves a job
take us out of the world wash
got us some crime to be done
it 's not relevant
i know it 's hard but the more i know the faster you UNknown l get better
this isn 't home ?
if we go home they UNknown l just send you back to the academy
this is safe for now
we 'r e on a ship
need a weave on that ?
it 's nothin
well they tell ya never hit a man with a closed fist but it is on occasion hilarious
none of us want the alliance on us doctor
that 's why you 'r e here
i thought i was here because you needed a medic
well not today
still a little whimsical in the UNknown
seems calm enough though
go from being a doctor on the central planets to hiding on the UNknown of the system
there 's not many would do that
why did you ?
i need the fare
are you referring to our perfectly legitimate business enterprises ?
i 'm wondering why a man so anxious to fly under alliance radar would house known fugitives
the alliance had her in that institution for a purpose whatever it was and they will want her back
you 'r e not overly fond of the boy so why risk it ?
because it 's the right thing to do
oh would you look at this
what about you shepherd ?
how come you 'r e flying about with us brigands ?
i mean shouldn 't you be off bringing UNknown to the fuzzy UNknown or some such ?
oh i got heathens UNknown right here
if i 'm your mission shepherd best give it up
you 'r e welcome on my boat
god ain 't
do you want me to put it up ?
no that 's okay
i 'm sure the doctor would agree
i mean i 'm just do you think it looks better up ?
we can experiment
you ever do this for your clients ?
have you ever had to service a really hideous client with boils and the like ?
a companion chooses her own clients
that 's guild law
you look for UNknown of spirit
there 's an energy about a person that 's difficult to hide
you try to feel that and then you try to feel the energy of their credit account
it has a sort of aura
what did i say to you about barging into my shuttle ?
that it was manly and impulsive ?
well you 'r e holding my mechanic in UNknown and UNknown what 's going on in the engine room ?
were there monkeys ?
i had to UNknown the UNknown thrust because somebody won 't replace that UNknown UNknown coil
get the place squared away
it 's dangerous in there and i ain 't payin you to get your hair played at
you 'r e UNknown crew now ?
in your lonely pathetic dreams
what do you want ?
we have a job
we UNknown l be landing on a UNknown in a bit
run by a fella called UNknown
never heard of him
is the petty criminal perchance ashamed to be riding with a companion ?
UNknown has a very UNknown rep
he 's got work for me fine
but i don 't
mal if you 'r e being a gentleman i may die of shock
eh malcolm reynolds is which ?
i 'm captain reynolds
we got word you might have a job for us
you have worked a train before ?
we did a few
as a rule no
well glad to hear that
you know what is reputation ?
is people talking
you see this man ?
uh he does not do the job
i show you what i do with him and now my reputation for you is fact
then you are solid
my wife 's nephew
there is no way out of that
so oh !
from your reputation ?
you take boxes off before you reach UNknown and deliver to crow here
half money now
anything goes wrong then your reputation only gossip and things between us not so solid
another 20 minutes
let 's get to work
he 's a psycho you know
nor the last
i just have an image in my head of a guy hanging from the ceiling
i got an image of it not being me
let 's do the thing
the caper ?
how long have you known him ?
i UNknown e been on this ship eight months now
i 'm not certain i UNknown l ever actually know the captain
i 'm surprised a respectable companion would sail with this crew
it 's not always this sort of work
they take the jobs they can get even legitimate ones
but the further you get away from the central planets the harder things are so this is part of it
i wish i could help
i mean i don 't wanna help
not help help but not with the thieving but
i do feel awfully useless
you could always pray they make it back safely
i don 't think the captain would much like me praying for him
don 't tell him
doesn 't concern us
i mean they 'r e not protecting the goods
if they were they wouldn 't be letting people past them
you don 't think that changes the situation a bit ?
i surely do
we get the goods
only now we do it under the noses of 20 trained alliance feds
and that makes them look all manner of stupid
hell this job i would pull for free
then can i have your share ?
oh i UNknown l do that then
so what are we doing ?
see we fly over the train car
the captain and zoe sneak in
we lower UNknown onto the car and they bundle up the booty and we haul UNknown m all back up
easy as lyin
the captain when it comes to plans
uh is you know is there anything i can something i should be doing ?
staying the hell out of everyone 's way
no call to be snappy UNknown
are you about to jump onto a moving train ?
captain ain 't around
you just play at figurin what 's wrong with that moon brained sister of yours till we call for you
dong ma ?
he 's not rich
yeah well we could all be rich if we handed her back
you 'r e not even thinking that
captain 's got a move he ain 't made yet
you UNknown l see
UNknown 's sources better be good
they shot my UNknown leg !
are they gonna be okay ?
everybody off !
all of the supplies
we UNknown e been waitin
all of it ?
all network alert
six crates of UNknown d
tag it received bounce it back
locals can deal with it
sir there is a regiment holding in UNknown
they were on the train headed to the installation
then get them back on the train and get it moving
who 's holding them there ?
the sheriff requested a few to help him investigate these are federal marshals not local narcotic hounds
they UNknown e got better things to do and so do we
UNknown let 's get us movin
now i 'm not i 'm not finished
why you got us parked here ?
this ain 't the UNknown vous spot
it is now
they 'r e not partial to waitin
let UNknown m read a magazine
we don 't make the sale until mal and zoe are back on the boat
these are stone killers little man
they ain 't UNknown like me
i 'm not flying anywhere without my wife
she UNknown l be okay
she 's with the captain
all right but what about the authorities ?
we 'r e sitting here with stolen alliance goods
won 't they be looking for us ?
if they buzz this canyon we UNknown l hear UNknown m before they see us
i figure we 'r e good for a they won 't stop
they UNknown l never stop
they UNknown l just keep coming until they get back what you took
two by two
is that a fun game ?
now i 'm in charge here and i 'm tellin you how it works
we don 't get the goods to UNknown on time he UNknown l make meat pies outta the lot of us !
i ain 't walkin into that
this UNknown UNknown you 'r e talkin about ?
now how would a shepherd know a name like that ?
as i UNknown e heard it he made a deal with the captain
if the captain 's not there to finish it if UNknown finds out he 's being held and may speak as to who hired him
i think we 'r e better off being a little late
this is a nightmare
that ain 't what i 'm talkin about
whatever happens remember i love you
we UNknown e been here for so long
did someone on the train get killed ?
no no no no
actually we 'r e here looking for work
that right ?
thought we 'd try our luck
you a miner by trade ?
either of you ?
well work is real scarce for a couple just startin out
how come there 's so many sick here ?
UNknown 's UNknown
affliction of the bone and muscle
turns out the uh air down underground mixed up with the ore UNknown
perfect recipe for UNknown 's
everybody gets it
but it 's UNknown
which is why you won 't be seein a parade in town today
that sounds like the alliance
unite all the planets under one rule so that everybody can be interfered with or ignored equally
alliance ain 't much use to us out here on the border planets but they ain 't the ones who stole the medicine
i ever find those people they ain 't ever gonna see the inside of a jail
i 'm just gonna toss UNknown m in a mine
let UNknown m breathe deep for the rest of their lives
can 't argue with that
never did myself
any job would do
did he ?
so would his job be open ?
that 's it
no UNknown way
they ain 't comin we can 't get UNknown m so they 'r e done
let 's fire it up
what 's going on ?
we 'r e takin off
we 'r e not
not in a million years ! !
listen to me
it 's a chain i beat you with till you understand who 's in command here
now we 'r e finishing this deal and then maybe maybe we UNknown l come back for those morons got themselves caught
you can 't change that by gettin all UNknown
all what ?
lift you up
i told him to sit down
you doped him
i i just didn 't feel comfortable with him in charge
i hope that 's all right
so how do we get the others ?
UNknown was right about them not making contact
chances are they got pinched gettin UNknown UNknown that train
we can 't just waltz in and pull UNknown m out
someone respectable enough might be able to
what the hell don 't you dare speak to me !
sheriff i want this man bound by law at once
that 's assuming he hasn 't been already
no one 's been bound
did you honestly think you could access my accounts and i wouldn 't find you ?
and zoe what would your husband say if he knew you were here ?
i i was weak
i imagine we UNknown l have to add another six months after this little adventure
i apologize for my manner
not a bit
do you need to hold them very much longer ?
looks to me like we 'r e about done here
we had some uh UNknown trouble
his story had kind of an odor to it
thank you very much sheriff
her files were all in order ?
i ran UNknown m twice
she hit me
he 's just heavy
we 'r e not going
not what ?
i waited for you guys !
what are you talking about ?
what about UNknown ?
there 's others need this more
let 's get it on the mule
my shuttle 's faster
and i don 't want to get slapped no more
far as UNknown goes we UNknown l explain to him the job went south when we return the money
you wanna explain now 's your chance
you didn 't make the UNknown vous
ran into a few complications
you are thinking of taking mr UNknown 's money and his property maybe
uh UNknown neither
deal 's off
there is no mind changing
i 'm afraid that 's where you 'r e wrong
we we just
so you just relax
there is no even
we UNknown l have to drag UNknown m from here
we can leave UNknown m just off the street
notify the sheriff once we 'r e in deep deep space
why not tell him in person ?
got word of a ship not far out
didn 't expect to be comin
these are tough times
he might not look too close at what that job is
but a man learns all the details of a situation like ours well then he has a choice
i don 't believe he does
let 's get these crates back to town make ourselves useful
now this is all the money UNknown gave us in advance
you bring it back to him
tell him the job didn 't work out
we 'r e not thieves
but we are thieves
we UNknown l stay out of his way as best we can from here on in
you explain that 's best for everyone
it doesn 't matter where you go or how far you fly
i will hunt you down and the last thing you see will be my blade
i 'm good
you should UNknown e let me do this sooner
i UNknown e had plenty worse
it 's just ow !
can 't say you made a lifetime friend
i UNknown l deal with him
yeah i 'm not too worried about you
how 's your sister ?
it 's like a child
so difficult to diagnose
hands of blue
two by two
there 's always one crisis we 'r e not interested
we 'r e here about a theft
we didn 't fly 86 million miles to track down a box of band UNknown colonel
we 'r e looking for a girl

whoa take it easy !
what have you got ?
there you go detective
son of sam braun
you bet your ass
built three casinos in a year
had ties to UNknown UNknown
wish i had tony braun 's gardener working for me
guy UNknown it out from the jump
blinds were drawn shut side gate UNknown dogs let out
a plus b plus c equals 911
all seems very neat and peaceful doesn 't it ?
chasing the dragon
with a UNknown back
so the rumours about old tony boy are true ?
drug overdose ?
if only life were that simple
eight rolls two copies
he was restrained
he had company
car blows its engine there 's an oil leak
guy od 's where 's the body fluid ?
UNknown vomit UNknown ?
interesting UNknown on chest
and he 's posed
yeah a dog owner on heroin
how responsible can he be ?
the gardener said it 's the first time in five years that he found this gate unlocked
what 's so different about this morning ?
the last morning of tony braun 's life ?
either somebody in the house opened it or somebody had a key because this lock hasn 't been forced
there 's no pry marks no metal UNknown
so why was the gate open ?
a heroin addict 's confetti
nothing like going on a binge
this is black tar heroin
it 's the difference between a cadillac and a pinto
how would you know ?
it 's my job
the dealer must have come down the chimney
it 's like christmas in july here
not that braun even needed any more drugs
looks like the guy had a pill for everything
can you get a print off those balloons ?
i can get a print off air
any luck ?
what about the cans outside ?
first thing i checked
his lifestyle was no secret
sex drugs and a big bankroll
no needle marks on his arms
the guy plays golf
whatever he did went up his nose
UNknown UNknown looks like raw hamburger
these UNknown around his mouth ?
or they 'r e pressure marks
for example if someone places a pillow or an object against someone 's nose and mouth in a struggle
UNknown UNknown also UNknown of UNknown
vessels can UNknown under innocent circumstances such as a violent cough
these three circular red marks on his chest
they 'r e not bug bites
no UNknown present
UNknown wasn 't performed
it 's hard to od just UNknown heroin
i know he was restrained which leads me to believe someone forced him to UNknown lethal amounts of heroin and UNknown
excuse me !
boy are you lucky my lawyer 's on a golf course
i UNknown e been standing out here in the heat for hours answering these stupid questions
here 's your answer ok ?
this is my house
who 's this ?
these are my things !
and uh where has she been the past 12 hours ?
well let 's see
she didn 't like the way tony acted when he was cruising on magic carpets
why don 't you just put the camera away before you get arrested ?
you can 't arrest me in my own house
right now your house is our crime scene
that includes UNknown you
you 'r e a woman
i 'm just looking out for my end here
you know ?
just make sure janine 's taken care of
that 's a lawyer 's call
hey i 'm in the will
of course you are
is sam braun in ?
he 's not seeing anyone today
would you let him know that catherine willows is here to see him ?
just one second please
you didn 't have any clothes on
yeah well that was a long time ago
i would have taken you home right then if i could have
i know but you were married and i was a baby
it would have never worked
hey sam how are you holding up ?
hey dad !
should i call security just handle it or what ?
i UNknown l take care of it
you go back to the pit
make sure nobody 's robbing us blind
you know back in uh in UNknown 7
i was in my 20s and i was drinking in a dive in downtown buffalo
at the end of the bar was this pro UNknown drinking double UNknown two at a time midnight to seven in the morning
it 's sunday
called my bookie bet against him
and i 'm not saying that just cos he was my kid
tony was the best damn casino exec this town has ever seen
just between you and me
i couldn 't hold a candle to him
and now he 's dead
nobody shoots at that target without going through me
well that 's business
did you ever talk to tony about any of his girlfriends ?
which one ?
can you believe it ?
and on the right gold digger prints i got from janine UNknown
here 's where it gets interesting
i took six prints off this bottle
good thing or bad thing ?
it 's good if you 'r e us bad if you 'r e janine UNknown
not tonight no
i don 't want to ruin any potential prints but i saw this tv dinner commercial and it hit me
i 'm gonna put it in the UNknown
did you try this coffee ?
oh don 't touch it !
that 's my pot !
your pot ?
blue hawaiian 40 a pound only grown a couple of times a year on the big island hand picked to perfection
you want a cup nick ?
i don 't know man
something back at that house must have bitten me
oh is that alcohol on a bug bite ?
like butter on burns man
it worked didn 't it ?
this is pretty good
see if catherine 's got clear nail polish
it UNknown l seal it off keep it from itching
what happened with that doggy door ?
something two legged went through it
we got mostly UNknown
be sure to check it against janine UNknown 's prints
braun 's stomach contents
UNknown and UNknown
didn 't find any
it 's my guess someone mashed up the UNknown dissolved them in red wine which i did find
well braun was a heroin addict using heavy just before he died which means he was probably meek as a lamb
it wouldn 't have taken much to bind his hands with UNknown tape
and make him drink UNknown
it 's a lot easier to pour liquid down a guy 's throat than it is to make him swallow 100 pills
it wasn 't 100 pills
how many ?
based on your UNknown i could take you in now
hey man i 'm in mourning
it 's tears you see
i lost a customer
you 'r e braun 's grocery store ?
but i deliver
the night before he croaked
about nine o UNknown lock
ask his woman
oh she didn 't go that fast
i dropped off some balloons braun paid me she gave me a tip
what shave the soul patch ?
first time i heard that
look i took two gave tony two and i accidentally dropped 15 or 20 down the sink
it was an accident
don 't pin that on me
your prints all over the bottle
i went to the pharmacy !
waited in line picked up the prescription signed for it brought it back to the house
you know tony did nothing for himself except work and get high
it got you a new mercedes didn 't it ?
yes it did
when you left your half a house where did you go ?
a friend 's
she 's out of town
let me guess
when 's this thing gonna be done ?
well with all due respect sir it 's not a baked potato
it 's braun 's blood
and with all the UNknown in his system it might take a little extra time
did i ever tell you i used to live in new york ?
is this gonna be a short story or a novel ?
beeping excuse me
after that it UNknown into morphine
what 's the 6 mam count ?
158 UNknown per mil
again not lethal
so braun should still be walking around
and the er point of your new york story was ?
oh i was just gonna tell you about another way to take heroin
a UNknown up the UNknown
you just stand on your head and let gravity
braun 's shirt
made a living intoxicating innocent victims and suffocating them sold the UNknown to teaching hospitals ?
got away with it too till a student discovered his UNknown e on a slab
is this part of the sherlock holmes fan club kit ?
janine UNknown said that she left the house when the drug dealer arrived
i think she came back
so braun would have been on his third or fourth balloon by then ?
it would have been easy to tape his wrists mash up 50 pills
force feed him a UNknown cocktail
everything was going great till the gardener showed up
and then i think her plan turned to panic
it takes time to od
time janine didn 't have
burke would kneel on his victim 's chest covering his mouth and nostrils
when you 'r e doing drugs you 'r e a slob
when you 'r e being UNknown you 'r e even UNknown
said he was in blue diamond digging something up
anybody ever tell you to call before you dig ?
i got permission to be here
oh is that right ?
from who ?
my name 's curt UNknown
look tony braun ?
this is his property
that 's what i 'm doing
do me a favour curt UNknown
put down the shovel
hey guys ?
a sable cloud turns forth its silver lining to the night
that 's a lot of motive
and a lot of silver
let me ask you something
braun collected silver
why bury it in blue diamond ?
cos he was smart
a commodity broker 's gonna charge you a storage fee per troy ounce
there 's only one thing worse than losing t 8 on silver a year
that 's losing 9 10 because of some stupid storage fee
what good 's collecting silver coupons when you 'r e dead ?
depends on who 's doing the clipping
oh we got a positive association !
roll to tape
tony asked me to move his silver collection to his ranch in wyoming
i 'm doing what i was told
mr UNknown ?
look i had nothing to do with the drugs
i swear to you i haven 't messed around with that stuff in a long time
i was always telling tony as a friend to get off of it
to walk away
i built the vault for him !
i 'm a contractor
ever work at his house ?
it never got off the ground
so you UNknown e been to his house ?
we were friends
i was there a couple of weeks ago
we watched the notre dame game
did you ever leave anything there or bring anything over to his house ?
yeah i brought a six pack and some chips
i got no idea what you 'r e talking about
whatever you don 't tell us we UNknown l find it
it 's the quickest warrant i ever got
or digging up silver
i don 't have to ask you that question
how can this be mandy ?
we found the tape in the guy 's truck
you 'r e telling us the prints on that tape aren 't his or hers ?
if their names are curt UNknown and janine UNknown the answer 's no
this is ridiculous
maybe you have the wrong suspects
that 's easy for you to say
all you do is scan prints all day and hit enter
look i 'm not your beast of burden
sara this is your thing
your doggy door prints
see what i mean ?
your prints came back unknown too ?
he 's a pit boss at the UNknown which is why his prints are on file
we got two suspects in custody and neither of their prints are on the UNknown tape
or on the doggy door
but the brother 's are
it 's been done
came back unknown
apparently this janine UNknown really got around
when she wasn 't at braun 's house playing girlfriend she was over at vault boy 's flat playing mistress
which gives neither of them a UNknown alibi
flimsy alibis don 't prove murder
what else have we got ?
curt UNknown goes back to UNknown till he posts bail
without curt 's prints on it
curt we 'r e out of here
you 'r e gonna take this too ?
no honey you 'r e out of here
bonnie take it easy easy ?
how many men do you need ?
i UNknown e stuck by you through UNknown UNknown lies and i UNknown e had it ok ?
so you choose
i could have told you over the phone
it 's a UNknown
tony and i went to dinner
how long ago ?
we ate at piero 's
talked a little business
my key still works here
how come it doesn 't work on the front door ?
i changed the locks
let tony in
when you 'r e a braun there 's nothing you can 't replace
you can 't replace your brother
what 's the matter with your leg ?
i don 't know
mind if i take a look ?
what are you a UNknown ?
i 'm an UNknown actually
i know all about bugs
it 's killing me
would you mind if i took a photograph
for my bite collection ?
whatever rubs your buddha
mr braun where do you live ?
UNknown hi rise
in the last 48 hours have you been anywhere else besides those two places ?
it might just get a little more routine
what time did you log in at the braun house ?
9 15 that morning
about a half hour
who is this ?
approximately 36 hours ago you were bitten
three hours earlier than that
tony braun was murdered
a UNknown UNknown itself to a hair UNknown and UNknown a UNknown UNknown into the skin which UNknown the surrounding cells allowing the UNknown to suck them up
leaving behind a red itchy bump
ah i don 't know boss
i mean ask yourself the question
are doggy door prints and UNknown bites enough to get a man for murder ?
what have we got ?
well i got motive
now jim that 's just a little callous
call it what it is
i mean i know you 'r e friends with the family but the guy used heroin
he was a drug addict who waited to inherit the old man 's fortune
and the brother ?
he 's out in the cold
he is ?
whatever he got he 'd split 50 50
all in silver included until about a month ago
but tony changed his mind which changed the will
so wait a second
that 's actually more than wishful thinking ?
bet walt wasn 't too happy about that his 50 50 going 75 25 the wrong way
curt was digging up the silver to protect janine 's interest
what 's in front of us that we 'r e missing ?
what evidence do we have that 's still open ?
i just got the references off walt braun gave the samples to greg
a couple of things on the priority list haven 't been processed
where 'd you find that ?
living room near the body
we have to deal with that
test it against janine
but i can save you the q tip
that 's really not my style
ms UNknown you have pierced ears
haven 't worn studs since like
god seventh grade
it goes to a stud earring
i don 't wear studs
i 'm more of a UNknown gal
i like UNknown
are you finished ?
how about your girlfriends ?
or tony 's girlfriends ?
any of them wear studs ?
look rule no
tony had a wandering eye he had a wad of cash
who needed that drama ?
what about the maid ?
i inherited josie and she cleans real good
how often does she vacuum ?
then the earring back was lost that day
but it was in the ear of a female
so i guess rule no
1 was broken
are you thinking what i 'm thinking ?
whoever 's prints are on the UNknown tape is missing an earring back
who 's the only other woman in the story ?
she lives in carson city
she 's here now
the fight in the police department ?
hell hath no fury
you know it 's funny
just recently i had a little education in earrings
and i noticed
so what ?
will you volunteer a dna sample ?
it will confirm your story or confirm ours
i 'm not giving you anything
it 's ok jim
we lifted your UNknown from the cheque that you posted for his bail
we compared it to a set of unknown prints we found on some UNknown tape at the crime scene
just like a pair of earrings identical
so you were at tony 's house the morning he died
along with walt braun whose prints we found on the doggy door
you know sometimes doing the job that we do our biggest break comes from the most innocent circumstance
it was the maid 's day off
but not the gardener 's
that 's the thing about murder
you never think to have a backup plan
the dogs led the gardener right to you
so you had to wing it and finish him off
the gardener came to the window
but he didn 't see you
so you removed the tape from tony 's wrists and made it look like an od
what i don 't get is you and walt braun didn 't move in the same circles
how 'd the two of you hook up ?
that 's the thing about my father
he could never give advice but he had a million stories
the scorpion and the frog
the scorpion needed to get across the creek and asked the frog for a ride
the frog says i can 't trust you you 'r e a scorpion
the scorpion says sure you can and UNknown on the frog 's back
midway across the scorpion stings the frog
the frog looks at him
why would you do that ?
now we 'r e both gonna die
the scorpion says
i 'm a scorpion
music and conversation
no my husband 's UNknown
tony had erased you from the will and bonnie wanted the people that hurt her to pay
ain 't love grand ?
you know this this could have all been his
his and tony 's
sure it is
i loved one son more than the other
it 's human nature
but you can hide it
and i didn 't
i made UNknown m i raised UNknown m
then one kills the other
hey sam ?
you know i should have married your mother
well considering i was six months old when you guys lit the flame a lot of time has passed
you had plenty of chances
it just wasn 't in the cards catherine
just wasn 't in the cards

a painful resemblance to the disciple and his master beethoven
the comedy gets hidden in the darkest human tragedy
today during the engagement of his daughter with mr fred UNknown the famous composer UNknown UNknown will give a private recital of his new symphony
a memorable evening
the music is getting on my nerves
bring me the punch bowl marie it will help to pass the time !
fred you can 't marry claire !
i will leave a letter explaining your blackmail
and i will kill myself the day before your wedding
it 's time to choose fred !
the theme of the symphony is as follows
at the feet of his master beethoven a musician distraught by the treason of women tries to forget and express his sadness
under the UNknown among the bracken it may have UNknown upon beethoven 's soul ! UNknown
from my great grief i fashion the little songs i utter ;
they lift bright wings and flutter off to her heart with passion h UNknown
after the triumph

new york tenth symphony your UNknown a great success
the storm has passed
abel UNknown writer and director
project UNknown UNknown
reconstruction of the subtitles
u s electrical engineering UNknown and his project for his diploma has become the subject of numerous comments
he proposed a great power plant heated with UNknown
the method of processing UNknown was simple safe and cheap and used UNknown 's secret method
but the plan threatened the welfare of a powerful UNknown oil trust
led by ross UNknown
have you ever been to the power station where mac UNknown works ?
we very much desire your presence in
while the order of the unknown to demonstrate much curiosity running to catch the train
UNknown decided to check the UNknown processing plant
a delighted UNknown casually encountered his former UNknown gem UNknown
UNknown had long cared very much for a girl
the young couple fell in love at first sight
let me return this glove
long expected !
the essence of my project is that everywhere there is UNknown
hydraulic UNknown makes it the cheapest fuel
now electricity will reach everyone
meanwhile the spies began to UNknown their plan
help us my partner is feeling badly
i hope your project will UNknown the electrical industry
but won 't the big oil trust be unhappy ?
if it fell into our hands !
i have been working with UNknown !
they want to know his secret !
UNknown UNknown 's faithful assistant saw that a disaster was coming
she would be interesting to know
who is that lovely girl ?
my god !
forgive my delay
weird things are happening
but if UNknown 's plan succeeds they will be worthless
i wanted to ask for some advice
where can we talk ?
your idea can really change the price of oil !
but isn 't it time for him to know
well what do i want to ask ?
meanwhile the conspirators continued their attempts to learn UNknown 's secret
i think that
i want to introduce betsy and gem
gem this is betsy
while UNknown tea gem began planning his wedding to betsy
UNknown immediately began to UNknown his plan
you are the only reason i came here so often
UNknown spent his time in the power plant
only a few days before putting his plan into action
betsy let me take your knight
why not visit us ?
look your friend comes to see gem almost every day
i often recall our meeting
i noticed your interest in betsy
but the work of his friend UNknown is endangering the welfare of our family
so do you think that UNknown 's project may change the price of oil ?
if on the opening day a small fault occurs a wave of potential UNknown will leave and UNknown be more flexible
should UNknown make it difficult for ?
gem realized he had to make a decision immediately
do you want me to do it ?
now you and i are partners !
i hope that betsy will not stay indifferent after that
UNknown was not here for the visits
this is the key to the processing UNknown
what is the matter that you want to talk about ?
i wanted to ask about
i miss you !
i lost the keys to the processing UNknown
don 't you have backup keys ?
returning from a hunt
how do you know !
UNknown 's employees under the direction of UNknown prepared for the next ceremony
UNknown could not forget the meeting with betsy whom he had seen that day
here 's to the success of our common cause !
mac UNknown is a great engineer !
this afternoon we will launch a new power plant designed by the young engineer mac UNknown
i congratulate him !
gem UNknown had precisely calculated the time
to cause a short circuit to create a fire in the UNknown UNknown
UNknown ross was looking forward
at last !
what happened ?
everything has been destroyed !
poor UNknown !
at last we can offer !

diane 11 30 am february 24th
i 'm entering the town of twin peaks
five miles south of the canadian border 12 miles west of the state line
i UNknown e never seen so many trees in my life
as UNknown fields would say i 'd rather be here than philadelphia
54 degrees on a slightly UNknown day
UNknown said rain
UNknown is 79 345
remind me to tell you how much that is
lunch was 6 and 31 cents at the UNknown inn
that 's on highway 2 near lewis fork
that was a tuna fish sandwich slice of cherry pie and a cup of coffee
damn good food !
looks like i UNknown l be meeting up with a
sheriff harry s truman
he UNknown l be at the calhoun memorial hospital
guess we UNknown l take a look at that girl who crawled down off the mountain
i 'm sure the sheriff can recommend a clean reasonably UNknown motel
that 's what i need a clean place reasonably UNknown
diane i almost forgot
they 'r e really something
agent cooper ?
stopped at the UNknown inn
had a slice of cherry pie
kind of lucky in a way that UNknown stepped out across the state line
whole town 's badly shaken up
sure it 's a nice quiet place
sheriff let me stop you for just a second
there 's a UNknown we UNknown e got to get straight
it 's best to talk about this up front
when the bureau gets called in the bureau 's in charge
you UNknown l be working for me
sometimes local law enforcement has a problem with that
we 'r e glad to have you here
sheriff what kind of fantastic trees have you got growing round here ?
the autopsy hasn 't been done yet but i UNknown l take you down to the morgue when we 'r e finished here
glad to know you
she 's in shock suffering from exposure
can i see her ?
all right this way
is there any connection to the dead girl ?
same high school
this girl doesn 't even know where she is or if she is
what exactly are you saying ?
we need a cat scan and we 'r e not equipped for that here
my opinion ?
she 's not responsive at all
i 'd like to examine her fingers
that 's not what i 'm looking for
there 's nothing here not a thing
don 't go there
he 's got a big mouth that starts talking to me
gary cooper ?
laura was a patient of mine
you 'r e going to the morgue
do you mind if i join you ?
yes i do
sort of against procedure doctor
you still could be at another time
i understand completely
they didn 't know that she was seeing me
that guy 's a psychiatrist ?
i have to apologise again for the UNknown lights
i think it 's a bad UNknown
that 's quite all right
agent cooper we scraped those nails when we brought her in
there it is
diane i 'm at the twin peaks county morgue with the body of the victim
i told you we 'd see this again
what have you got there ?
ring finger under the nail
let 's see what he left us
it 's an 'r
don 't go to sam
albert has a bit more on the ball
ok cooper are you going to let me in on what 's going on here ?
sheriff we UNknown e got a lot to talk about
he came by
i UNknown e already been to the roadhouse
i don 't know honey
he told me to give you this
what the hell are you doing ?
i UNknown e been looking all over for you
bobby 's in a lot of trouble
he 's my best friend
we 'r e going to the police station to be with him
don 't tell me where i ought to be !
second laura was my best friend
get in the car
ed i 'm not your friend
donna you get to the sheriff 's right now
i sure know howto pick them
you waiting for those drapes to hang themselves ?
i know howto pick them too
if james comes around will you tell him i 'm looking for him ?
that 's the UNknown we just saw the one we found in laura 's bedroom
at a certain point i 'm going to want to UNknown to the boyfriend
you say when
why not ?
this is the last entry dated february 23rd
and then she 's written
nervous about meeting UNknown tonight
that 's the letter UNknown diane
and that is the last entry
that 's something to get started on
yeah that 's one out of 26
one out of 26
taped to the page is a plastic envelope containing a white residue and a key to a safety deposit box
sheriff we have to very carefully remove this key
we 'r e going to run this envelope
my bet is it will test positive for cocaine
that 's impossible
mr cooper you didn 't know laura palmer
let 's get a court order to open the safety deposit box and maybe we UNknown l both find out a UNknown about laura palmer
diane i 'm holding a small box of chocolate UNknown
tell harry we found where it happened
where UNknown and laura were taken and tortured
am i correct ?
so what ?
i didn 't kill her
bobby here 's UNknown works we ask the questions and you answer the questions that we ask briefly and to the point
did you shoot this video bobby ?
if you didn 't then who did ?
did you know laura was seeing someone else ?
that 's what you fought about last week
look at these pictures
you ever do cocaine with laura bobby ?
i don 't do drugs
excuse me what are you charging my client with ?
that 's right
if you knew who she was seeing tell us
ask donna she was with her
i 'm asking you
here 's a hint first initial UNknown
no she wouldn 't do that to me
you didn 't love her anyway
let him go
when mr UNknown returns make sure they do not hear about laura palmer 's death
that will UNknown whole deal
got it ?
you wouldn 't
did they UNknown the whole UNknown ?
audrey don 't go in there
i 'm hungry
excuse me is there something wrong young pretty girl ?
they found my friend laura
lying face down on a rocky beach completely naked
she 'd been murdered
just a sec

i have no idea what 's going on here
let 's just go home
so you were on a picnic just the two of you ?
way up in the mountains not another soui around ?
is there some law against having a picnic ?
donna this is interesting to me
with just two of you out there
i can 't figure out UNknown pictures got taken
that 's easy
she had a UNknown and we asked her to take the pictures for us
what was her name ?
i don 't think we asked her
nobody that 's really what happened
does this person 's name start with the letter UNknown ?
she didn 't tell us her name
donna this is serious business
more serious than laura falling in love with someone other than her boyfriend
much more serious
you can come on in
i know laura was your best friend
you UNknown e been through a lot today
we 'r e finished for now
go ahead lucy
after bobby was taken back to his cell his parents were standing by the door with his lawyer
bobby was released and he came out and saw his friend mike who was down by the water cooler which is near my desk
i pretended to be typing but i was typing what mike and bobby were saying
they didn 't say exactly who it was they were talking about but anyway here 's what they were saying
they said the person we 'r e looking for is a UNknown
looks like a hog to me
the UNknown are gone
better that than throw a lifetime away
you stay out of this !
here 's something we haven 't seen before a UNknown of dirt a foot and a half in UNknown
on the top is a gold necklace with a gold heart
correction half a gold heart
at the base of the UNknown of dirt is a torn piece of UNknown written with the words which appear to be in blood
fire walk with me
mrs UNknown ?
so you think it might help ?
you can tell johnny one more time that laura isn 't coming this afternoon to work with him
or tomorrow afternoon or any afternoon
what is so difficult to understand about that ?
it fell down
when was the last time she came in ?
i couldn 't tell you exactly
we have so many box es
you don 't keep records ?
we have plenty of paperwork
how long has she had this box ?
i 'd say about six months
i could check for you
would you please ?
that 's a lot of girl scout cookies
here 's a page that 's marked
there 's your connection

hang on UNknown
one year ago in a town in the south west corner of this state the body of a young girl named teresa banks was found
she had no family
it wasn 't even news until today
it is UNknown important that this not turn into a witch hunt
i would suggest a temporary curfew for those under eighteen years of age
keeping your kids off the streets now may teach them caution that may protect them in the days and weeks to come
i will remind you that these crimes occurred at night
when i left the house sarah was sleeping
leland made it through the day somehow
i 'm not sure i could have done the same
poor dear poor sarah
wisely i suppose
it was laura 's
i 'm telling you this because donna was in the video with her
she won 't tell them who shot it or who else was with them but they think the killer may have the other half of the heart
donna which do you like better ?
the blossom of the evening or the full flower of the evening ?
listen to me this is serious
this is serious too
don 't you know there 's a curfew ?
they announced it on the radio
i know einstein
i suppose this will include a phone conversation with mike
mr UNknown boyfriend ?
then pump some air in the back tyre
actually now that some time has passed
i like the full blossom of the evening
don 't you worry about that
hi doctor hayward
donna 's upstairs getting ready for bed mike

when your sweetheart 's husband 's in the joint for manslaughter the word parole has a nasty ring to it
you know why i 'm UNknown ?
ok i UNknown l bite again
why are you UNknown ?
that 's what you do in a town where a yellow light still means slow down not speed up
mike and bobby
scottie mutt and jeff just crawled in

what 's down there ?
an old UNknown road
i told doc hayward his daughter was ok
my fault harry
i 'm going to talk to them but i think they 'r e going to lock me up
i was with her
it was kinda like a nightmare
donna she was a different person
what are you saying ?
i 'm telling you there were things she was involved with things she let herself get pulled into things she thought you 'd hate her for
she said there are things about me
she said even donna doesn 't know me
i knew her
donna she said something about a guy getting killed
oh my god
it all makes some kind of terrible sense that she died that someone killed her
i don 't know
i didn 't know whether to believe any of this last night
i mean half the time she wasn 't making any sense
i couldn 't calm her down
i could hardly keep her on the bike
we came to the light at UNknown and 21 and she she put her hands around my neck and she screamed she loved me
i looked into her eyes
they were clear
she was so sad
it 's ok
it 's ok
oh my god
i don 't have an alibi
after she left i just rode around
the necklace you gave laura with the golden heart
you have to give me the other half
if you go there with the necklace and no alibi
what about you ?
what goes around comes around
round and round
james stand away from the bike
stand away from the girl
put your hands behind your head
he didn 't do anything !
she 's probably right
lucy get an arrest form ready
doc i 'm releasing her to you but i want her back for questioning in the morning
all right harry
good night officers
i 'm sure you understand what you put your mother and me through tonight
but i know you wouldn 't have done it unless you had a good reason
we also have another problem facing us young lady
where 's your sister 's bicycle ?
i left it at the roadhouse
we UNknown l have to go get it
i understand you promised harriet you 'd put some air in the back tyre
yes i did
a policeman 's dream !
yup lucy sets it up for us every night
is everything ok ?
you know andy 's been drinking so much UNknown coffee lately
thank you lucy
sheriff that reminds me
it doesn 't have to be fancy
i can get you a good rate up at the great northern
i think i 'm going to be here for some time
these motels promise you a good rate but when you get there it 's a different story
all i need is a bed a bathroom a telephone and sometimes a television in the event i get a chance to knock off early
i can get you a good rate up at the great northern
i UNknown l be staying locally at the great northern hotel
sheriff 's getting me a rate
when you least expect it
yes i did
i 'm afraid
all those not seated must wait for the next show
we filed slowly UNknown into the hall
the auditorium was vast and silent
after we 'd sat down it grew dark and the voice continued
the program for this evening isn 't new
you know it through and through
you UNknown e seen birth life and death
you might recall all of the rest
did you have a good life before you died ?
enough to base a movie on ?
hey jim it 's your birthday man !
let 's finish this another night
turn the lights down a little bit more
hey man how come the doors aren 't in on this ?
no music no doors
let me tell you about heartache and the loss of god
wandering wandering in hopeless night
out here in the perimeter there are no stars
out here we 'r e stoned immaculate
it 's beautiful look at those clouds
jimmy wake up !
i don 't know
just a dream jimmy that 's all it is
just a dream
waste of time
you followed me ?
maybe you should meet my old man
what 's your name ?
mine 's jim
i have no idea
listen children to the sound of the UNknown night
in the s UNknown the UNknown leads a UNknown panic
he acts like a madman a professional hysteria
have you ever seen god ?
columbus 's UNknown got filled with green death
i touched her thigh and death smiled
hey morrison !
it 's non UNknown poetic it 's what UNknown stands for
this world this world is a will to power and nothing besides
very pretentious jim not easy to follow
a little UNknown
what do you guys think ?
no it was worse !
a guy sleeping for 7 hours !
there was no political content !
you need your art spoon fed to you !
right on man !
mr morrison ?
choose the day and choose the sign of your day
the day 's divinity the first thing you see
come on out for a walk !
it 's a beautiful night !
the vast radiant beach and cool UNknown moon
couples naked race down by its quiet side and we laugh like soft mad children smug in the UNknown cotton brains of UNknown
choose they UNknown the ancient ones
the time has come again
choose now they UNknown beneath the moon beside an ancient lake
enter again the sweet forest
enter the hot dream come with us
everything is broken up and dances
now i have come again to the land of the fair strong and wise
brothers and sisters o UNknown r the pale forest
children of the night who among you will run with the hunt ?
now night arrives with her purple legion
retire now to your tents and dreams
tomorrow we enter the town of my birth
i want to be ready
that 's beautiful
it 's beautiful !
what 's a UNknown ?
he 's the medicine man of the indians
he gets into a UNknown trance and he gets deeper and deeper and has a vision and the whole tribe is healed
all UNknown have a version of it
the greeks had theater and gods
the indians say the first UNknown invented sex
they call him the one who makes you crazy
what turns you on ?
i don 't know
and i saw a friend of mine who was christ but he was judas too
and i realized that somehow that was the secret of everything
we 'r e all one the universe is one
and everything is beautiful
i think you 'r e most alive recognizing beauty seeing truth
does death turn you on ?
you love death ?
when you die the pain 's over
all the poems have wolves in them
all but one
she dances in a ring of fire and throws off the challenge with a UNknown
that 's beautiful

this is the fun part of my job this is history in the making

andy UNknown is more than an artist
he is art
does andy imitate life or does life imitate andy ?
jim this is tom baker he 's in one of andy 's movies
i a man
he 's italian but he lives in paris from a famous family 700 years old
you are great eh i see you at UNknown with hendrix

there were so many people
andy this is jim morrison of the world famous doors musical group
andy UNknown of course
how are you doing andy ?
the paintings were getting crushed and they had to take them all down
it looked kind of great
just a wall
you should do a show with just bare walls
we would really love to use you in one of our movies jim
you 'r e such a beauty
andy says everybody will be famous for 15 days
it would really be great wouldn 't it ?
the UNknown not the voyage
the trip not the arrival
somebody gave me this telephone
i think it was edie wasn 't it
it was edie
here this is for you
now you can talk to god
morrison come here !
i think god wants to talk to the bum
check it out brother
love death travel revolt
i 'm interested in chaos disorder especially activities which seem to have no meaning like this
how do you feel about being called the ultimate barbie doll ?
when you say something like that it 's a shortcut to thinking
what about the dreadful reviews your new poetry book has gotten ?
i guess they didn 't understand
didn 't you finance its publication ?
have you bothered to read the poetry ?
i mean you keep denying that anything good can come out of l a
that 's a rather provincial attitude
do you believe in drugs ?
ich believe in excess
it 's the american way
we spend more money every year on alcohol and tobacco than on education
on behalf of british press where will you see the doors in five years ?
what do you spend all your money on ?
i believe in a long prolonged UNknown of the senses to attain the unknown
although i live in the subconscious our pale reason hides the infinite from us
are you by any chance in a trance now mr morrison ?
do you hurt ?
what do your parents think about what you 'r e doing ?
i don 't remember being born
it must have happened during a blackout
they must have expressed some feeling
to tell you the truth they 'r e not living anymore so
i don 't like to talk about that
could you at least tell us how they died ?
it was a horrible car crash in new mexico in the 50 's
my father ran right into a UNknown of UNknown
they were all over the highway bleeding
their souls kind of stirring in the breeze just UNknown into mine
i 'm sorry
don 't worry about it
it happens to other guys too
wanna do some coke ?
it UNknown l loosen you up
sure a new thing
that 's 14th century
you ever try drinking blood ?
they used to dance in the forests naked
i think that 's what offended the UNknown and led to the UNknown
they were a sexual threat to their male order
like the UNknown
the first witches
where do you get the blood ?
blood is the rose of mysterious union
a symbol of UNknown
don 't be such a child !
if i do it you have to do it
you do it
fuck me good !
what can i do baby ?
what 's the matter baby ?
will you die for me ?
what do you want me to do ?
maybe i should see a doctor or something
what do you think someone from the UNknown philosophy ?
it happens to other guys too
that 's the irony
it 's not so complicated it 's just sex you know
i UNknown l never wake up in a good mood again
it 's the hours and the pressure to do everything like it 's your last performance
we weren 't built to last
you never know
you never know
do you really know what i am pam ?
you know what poetry is ?
you don 't belong on the ed sullivan show
who am i ?
where is the new wine ?
dying on the vine ?

i love fame
and that 's gonna help ?
maybe if you just put a little soul in your success
suck it mommy come on !

where do you think you 'r e going ?
i love my girl !
how many other guys have you fucked since you been with me ?
how many dogs have you fucked ?

your father 's an admiral in the navy
he was at the gulf of tonkin when the UNknown war broke out
your dad 's deputy chief of operations
just don 't ever lie to me again ok ?
what 's so hard about tracing your records ?
you went to the university of florida albuquerque new mexico
arlington virginia washington d c
you have a brother and a sister
seven miles long it 's all in the end
where the fuck is jim ?
i 'm sorry
did he love you ?
how much ?
that doesn 't matter anymore does it ?
do you hear them out there ?
are you listening to them ?
it 's you they want now
it 's not the doors

we wanted some privacy so we went into this shower stall
no we weren 't doing anything just talking
all of a sudden this little man came in with a little blue hat and a little blue suit
and he said what are you doing in there ?
and i said nothing
or what ? i said
and he started pushing me
yeah so i started pushing back
he didn 't like that
then he reached behind and he pulled out a little can of UNknown
and he UNknown it right in my eyes
he fucking blinded me !
in the united states of america !
land of the free home of the brave
in god we trust
the show 's over
you 'r e under arrest
there you go

i will not go
jlm is UNknown to have UNknown of heart UNknown
he was 27
as shackleton and his men on their ship the endurance prepared to leave british waters on august 4th 1914
britain declared war on germany
shackleton was presented with an UNknown dilemma and he and his men all offered their services to the military effort but were given the one word instruction from the admiralty
like everyone else at that time they believed fighting would be over by christmas 1914
on their return they would find the war had another two years to run
joining the crew of the endurance at buenos aires was the australian photographer frank hurley
hurley was a tough resourceful and fearless adventurer who 'd been on one UNknown expedition with the australian explorer douglas UNknown
it was hurley 's films and photographs of that expedition when shown in britain that had attracted shackleton to him
never one of the most financially wise of explorers
frank hurley was on a photographic expedition in north australia when an UNknown messenger boy brought a telegram to him carried in a UNknown stick
shackleton the great explorer had appointed him official photographer to the imperial UNknown expedition
if he was agreeable to this he should be in buenos aires by october 10th
hurley immediately abandoned his expedition and crossed half the globe to join shackleton a man he had never met reaching buenos aires a few days before him
this delay was due to reports of unusually severe ice conditions in UNknown that year
the first ominous signs of the ship 's fate were there to be read but on december 7th they sailed out once more
with them were 69 canadian sledge dogs
several of the dogs were to die during a small epidemic of worm UNknown
nevertheless they were popular among the crew and proved valuable companions during the more tedious stretches of the expedition
just as important they were UNknown and likely to be popular with cinema audiences and frank hurley made sure that he covered their presence UNknown
UNknown scenes of animal life were essential to the film 's commercial success
several crew members are seen in these opening scenes of the expedition
macklin UNknown medicine to one of the dogs with the assistance of reginald james the cambridge educated UNknown to the expedition
james had been surprised in his interview with shackleton before gaining the post to have been asked if he could sing with his abilities as a UNknown taken as read
indeed james 's UNknown was to prove a great boon in the darker days ahead
in these scenes a moody shackleton paces around in the background and at one point even aims a kick at one of the dogs
sir ernest shackleton had been UNknown after his UNknown south achievement
he was an UNknown irishman born in county UNknown in UNknown
the attempt failed UNknown and shackleton suffered UNknown from scurvy
he and scott also discovered a mutual UNknown that UNknown as each mounted separate expeditions in the race for the pole
however he had then to pay off the considerable debts of the expedition which took up much of his time as he UNknown widely
meanwhile his great rival scott mounted his own expedition in UNknown in what became a race for the pole with the norwegian UNknown UNknown
UNknown using skis and dog teams with an ease and a UNknown that totally UNknown the british explorers reached the pole on the 14th december UNknown
scott and four men arrived second on january 17th 1912
all five died on the return journey
but what scott lacked in basic UNknown skills he made up for at least as far as posterity was concerned in his literary gift
his UNknown and UNknown expressed final words in his UNknown when these became known to the world in UNknown set in motion a powerful myth
scott was a hero and had died a hero 's death
shackleton had to try and go one better than either UNknown or scott
america had captured the north pole and norway the south now britain must try to UNknown an entire continent
the plan was that the main endurance party led by shackleton would journey from the UNknown sea towards the pole
it is generally considered that shackleton 's plan was wildly UNknown and would very probably have resulted in disaster for all concerned
as it was the UNknown sea and the ross sea parties were destined never to meet and indeed shackleton was destined never even to make land
the last great polar journey was instead to become perhaps the greatest escape story in the history of UNknown
only two days out of south georgia the endurance first encountered the pack ice at the edge of the UNknown sea
as they had been warned on south georgia they were now entering upon an UNknown cold season and ice was soon thick about them
frank UNknown commander of the endurance guided the ship through the UNknown avoiding the main pack ice so far as he could often using the endurance as a battering ram
it is UNknown if it is hurley that the film shows UNknown back along the UNknown boom for that begs the question who is taking the film of him ?
shackleton here climbs the crow 's nest and shouts down instructions to frank UNknown who in turn signals in UNknown to the helmsman
the helmsman is james UNknown the expedition 's geologist though soon circumstances will force a change of subject for him as he inevitably became more involved with UNknown than geology
the colour UNknown shown in these shots of icebergs and elsewhere throughout the film was common among films of the period
in the time before natural colour film stocks became available the audience 's desire for colour was satisfied by the use of colour UNknown being added to the UNknown print
a practice that was common and expected
such colour UNknown the photography and the dramatic effect and the results were often UNknown beautiful
thus the film in its colourful form is how its original audience would have seen it when it was first UNknown in 1919
the endurance UNknown on through the UNknown icy waters through december and january
on january 10th land was spotted and they were but a week 's journey away but they were fated never to attain it
the ship UNknown its way along the coastline seeking an opening amid the UNknown but a blizzard arose and the endurance went to the UNknown side of an iceberg
shackleton wrote of this day
the men cut away the young ice before the bows and pulled it aside with great energy
every opening we made froze up again quickly owing to the UNknown low temperature
the young ice was UNknown and prevented the ship delivering a strong splitting blow to the UNknown while at the same time it held the older ice against any movement
the UNknown of the attack was a great disappointment to all hands
the UNknown ice seen being UNknown away here was more of a UNknown than it appeared as it created a UNknown cushion effect that greatly UNknown the ship 's progress
alfred UNknown third officer on the endurance had experience of the UNknown having been on previous expeditions with both shackleton and scott
he would be one of the few of shackleton 's men to die in combat in the first world war drowning after a torpedo attack on a UNknown in 1918
what a great courageous and inspired cameraman frank hurley was
all in vain the UNknown ice would not yield
the polar winter meant increasing days of almost total darkness
leading until UNknown 's day in june and hurley was naturally very restricted in what he could film
most of the following scenes of the imprisoned endurance and her crew were filmed in march and april
as will have been observed the film makes much use of hurley 's still photographs
their UNknown and dramatic compositions
he imposed a strict winter routine abandoning normal ship 's routine and no longer maintaining normal sea watches
instead one man was night watchman in turn while the others adopted a regular pattern of work by day and sleep by night
he UNknown that every hand was playing his part in the smooth running of the expedition
UNknown in the evening were devised
songs were led by the UNknown leonard UNknown who had brought a banjo and there was a contest to name the worst singer on board won comfortably by shackleton himself
hurley gave lantern slide shows of his travels to the far east and his previous UNknown journey with douglas UNknown
though the entertainment value to the crew of seeing still further views of ice and snow may be questioned
mock trials were held and were very popular and plays parlour games chess guessing games
animal vegetable mineral
water naturally had to be gathered from blocks of ice shown here being gathered and hauled up into the ship 's hold
and frank hurley himself required up to a ton of ice each time for the solution and washing of his UNknown films as part of the developing process
itself an UNknown job with constantly freezing water and splitting fingers
a key feature in keeping the men occupied and amused in the months of imprisonment were the dogs
took particular care of the puppies born in january
the scientists kept to the limited routine available to them
the ship 's engineers were without occupation and the doctors had more to do in attending to the dogs than to the men
as it was a number died of worm UNknown
it is also worth remembering the sad fact that after a certain point in this film we see no more of the dogs
very simply and necessarily when supporting them finally became impractical they were shot
here frank UNknown and reginald james are shown preparing seal meat for the UNknown
steaks were cut in long strips from the head to the tail of the seal and laid out on the ice where they froze into long firm pieces like boards
fresh seal and penguin meat was essential in UNknown their provisions and in maintaining good health
among some of the UNknown superstitions revealed among the sailors one named thomas mcleod refused to eat UNknown because he believed the souls of dead fishermen UNknown within them
others looked upon the scientists UNknown of UNknown with great suspicion and thought that they might be looking for gold hidden inside their stomachs
their stomachs were in fact more likely to yield freshly caught fish
far more valuable in the circumstances
the first team to set off is headed by alexander macklin followed by that UNknown by his fellow surgeon james UNknown
frank wild 's team follows and although they start badly by UNknown their sledge they were the UNknown winners
frank hurley 's own dog team was shown next led by shakespeare and those shown here on the sledge are UNknown macklin and chief officer on the endurance lionel UNknown
it was probably more for such skills and his general UNknown rather than his somewhat UNknown interest in UNknown that UNknown joined the UNknown expedition
although in the dark of UNknown hurley was unable to film he nevertheless set up this famous set of flash photographs of the endurance
taken on the 27th of august UNknown with the temperature in the minus 20s UNknown
hurley UNknown 20 flashes on UNknown of ice around the ship ten flashes alone being required to UNknown the ship
the haunting image of a ghost ship UNknown the endurance 's approaching fate
this still photograph UNknown the result
a sad failure of the shackleton expedition was the motor UNknown
much hope was placed in these caterpillar track vehicles and they had a special engineer devoted to their care
the solitary and widely unpopular thomas UNknown UNknown seen here driving the UNknown
his UNknown but observant UNknown have proved to be an invaluable source of information for writers seeking to understand the character of the expedition
the shackleton expedition was UNknown at least a scientific one and took with it a geologist a UNknown a UNknown and a UNknown
everyone was involved in hauling up the UNknown nets which brought up specimens from the depths
this was all for the benefit of the UNknown robert clark the expedition 's UNknown who is shown examining the UNknown nets
he was a UNknown UNknown figure single UNknown dedicated to his task widely respected for his UNknown taste for hard work
sadly all his specimens were to be lost when the ship eventually UNknown to the ice an outcome that was now inevitable
as the title dramatically puts it with the arrival of august it was the beginning of the end for the endurance
it was to be a prolonged death
the ship was knocked further up its rudder was smashed and then the keel was pierced and further water poured in
shackleton wrote in his journal
after long months of UNknown anxiety and strain after times when hope beat high and times when the outlook was black indeed the end of the endurance has come
it is hard to write what i feel
to a sailor his ship is more than a floating home and in the endurance i had UNknown ambitions hopes and desires
now straining and groaning her timbers cracking and her wounds gaping she is slowly giving up her UNknown life at the very UNknown of her career
the sequence here showing the ship being crushed by the ice has been deliberately UNknown by hurley
the film was put deliberately slowly through the camera by turning its handle too slowly
this has the effect of making the action seem UNknown up so that the ice can be shown moving
it also has the effect of making the men on deck move around over fast
the ship was locked up further by a pressure ridge and the keel torn open
water UNknown in
all stores were off loaded onto the ice and the dogs slid down canvas chutes
camp was made on the ice beside the stricken ship and was given the name dump camp
shackleton now planned a march across the ice
he ordered that as much gear as possible was to be left behind with each man carrying just basic supplies and two pounds of personal possessions
very soon however the proposed march across the ice hauling the three boats was abandoned as hopelessly impractical
most significant amongst them was frank hurley who with one of the sailors walter how returned to the endurance and determined to rescue UNknown films and photographic plates
these were held in the ship 's refrigerator which now lay below the water line
breaking his way through broken timbers and having failed to get the films with hooks
hurley UNknown explained to shackleton what should have been obvious
that the expedition 's expenses to a very large degree depended on the preservation of the UNknown film and still photographs
hurley thereafter took with him just some roll film and a small pocket camera and left his UNknown UNknown camera behind
hurley was in perfect position to record the final death UNknown of the ship UNknown the snapping of the mast
leading to the bitter point on november 21st UNknown when she finally sank beneath the ice
she 's gone boys were shackleton 's simple heartfelt words
indeed there was little anyone could think to say in the UNknown of the moment and hurley 's pictures alone are more eloquent than words
the UNknown of ocean camp is UNknown UNknown in these still photographs
shackleton and hurley shared a tent and are shown here shackleton on the left
most of the inhabitants of ocean camp are pictured here with shackleton and second in command frank wild standing nearest on the right
these scenes of a dog team being led by lionel UNknown were presumably taken earlier since hurley had by now disposed of his UNknown camera
a photograph of patience camp itself where the waiting dragged on and foul weather kept them mostly to their tents
april 1916 the ice having finally broken the men all took to the three boats
the james UNknown the UNknown wills and the dudley UNknown
the camp made on an ice UNknown brief respite during an UNknown six days and six nights voyage with clothes frozen stiff all the men desperately thirsty
this UNknown it was that cracked and sent one of the sailors UNknown into the water
he was swiftly fished out but only kept alive by UNknown of men keeping him moving UNknown all night
yet this was only the next stage of the adventure the next step to survival
shackleton and five men
shackleton and the five crew members of the james UNknown arrived in the wrong that is UNknown side of south georgia and leaving the other three behind
shackleton UNknown and UNknown UNknown the UNknown mountains of south georgia
this would have been an achievement enough in itself in normal conditions but following immediately after an UNknown boat journey it all but slips into the UNknown of fantasy
boss i had a curious feeling on the march that there was someone else with us
UNknown confessed to the same idea
when i count there are only you and i together
but when i look ahead up the white road
there is always another one walking beside you
instead the film now shows us a great deal of what made it a commercial proposition when it was first shown to the public in 1919
on his return to south georgia he followed suit and gave us these scenes UNknown filmed in themselves though they undoubtedly UNknown the drama
but this is how the film was presented in 1919 and it is as just such an original document that it is presented now
it is to be noted that the title writer UNknown some ingenuity in connecting the various animal scenes with the experiences of shackleton taking place off camera
of the crossing of south georgia the camera can show nothing except the scenery
these scenes show UNknown the UNknown port where shackleton and the other staggered into the town their faces UNknown their clothes in UNknown
two young boys came across them first and ran away in fright
shackleton made his way to the manager of the UNknown station introduced himself and asked first if the war was over
he received the UNknown reply the war is not over
millions are being killed
it is a commercial film that we are watching after all
and now the film comes to its conclusion with UNknown
having UNknown the three men he left on the other side of south georgia
shackleton made four attempts to get his ship to his men on elephant island
shackleton had brought his men through and not a life had been lost

sir arne 's treasure a winter ballad in five acts
sets and UNknown created and UNknown by axel UNknown chief engineer
during the reign of king johan ill a bitterly cold winter swept over sweden the likes of which had never been seen in living memory
the king discovered a conspiracy among his scottish mercenary troops
the soldiers of fortune were ordered to leave and were kept under guard until crossing the border
their leaders were bold and fearless men
they were arrested and sent to the tower
they UNknown rough hides and claimed to be UNknown UNknown roaming the country in search of work
and by the time they reached the border they were completely famished
in those days in UNknown there lived an UNknown fish UNknown a man known as UNknown
most of his time was spent on the road selling salted and dried fish
the sea has frozen over
not only the UNknown and sounds but quite far out to sea
since we will pass by the UNknown at UNknown we could stop there and ask if the ice will bear our weight all the way to UNknown
generally the dog was still and merely UNknown at his master words
but when he heard something that displeased him he climbed on top of the load they carried pointed his nose UNknown and UNknown
dear dog what do you have against UNknown ?
have we not many times swung past the UNknown to pay visit to sir arne ?
at the UNknown the state known as UNknown the vicar sir arne ate his supper in the company of his UNknown
the vicar was an old man who retained his dignity and UNknown
the vicar 's wife
and his gaze kept returning to the iron clad chest at the foot of the four poster bed
this is were sir arne stored a fortune in silver coins and it was said they filled the chest to the very brim
tell me why are they UNknown such long knives over at UNknown g on this very night ?
do you not hear the scraping and filing ?
do you not hear the hissing and squealing ?
how can you hear them UNknown knives over at UNknown g ?
that estate is miles away
pray let us finish our supper
and all the townspeople were invited
the old saying holds true
the closest neighbor is the last to arrive
i UNknown l still see them in my mind 's eye UNknown their knives
god only knows what they plan
fortunately the lady vicar 's vision was no more ominous than a few UNknown UNknown preparing the tools of their trade
long after UNknown a few men left the inn at UNknown g in order to saddle their horses and return home
come out !
last night sir arne and his entire household were murdered by three men who entered the house though the smoke hole in the roof men dressed in rough hides
sir arne 's horse is gone and so is the sleigh !
UNknown 's cottage was situated at the highest point of the island
she would ponder how blessed they were to have something to look forward to
she UNknown for nothing on earth
i am not wealthy enough UNknown to feed and clothe you so that you may remain idle and UNknown your grief
oh mother UNknown !
she pleaded for mercy but one of the men stabbed her in the heart
had i not hidden behind a wall i would be with my dear foster sister now !
i hope they are alive so i may rip their hearts from their chests !
i hope they are alive so i may see them drawn and quartered !
we did not come to frighten you good maiden but to ask you to share your tale with us
we came to UNknown to book passage to scotland but all the UNknown and sounds are frozen
now we while away the hours and would be much obliged if you would share your tale with us
show the gentleman you do not lack the breeding to respond properly UNknown !
you were born to a higher station and are not a lowly fish wench
after that day sir archie often UNknown to UNknown 's cottage to speak to UNknown
god himself has sent you to me UNknown !
UNknown will you accompany me to scotland as my wife ?
there i will build you a castle of UNknown you will be the distinguished mistress
do you see the hair UNknown my hand UNknown ?
do you see the lock of fair hair ?
in this very same manner the hair of my foster sister was twisted around the hand of her killer
we frighten ourselves unnecessarily UNknown
look it was but a few UNknown shining in from the window
sir archie !
leave me leave me sir archie
for now my mind dwells solely upon the dead
grim my dear dog you can no longer doubt that we travel across the sea
look a large ship is locked in the ice
what do you say ?
shall we call to the skipper and see if he wants to buy our fish ?
if the ice does not break it would be impossible to set sail for scotland
sir archie wishes to discuss this matter with the skipper
a man like yourself who travels everywhere and hears everything do you know why god keeps the gates of the sea barred for so long ?
holding us all captive ?
once i spent a whole month in bergen when UNknown were so strong not a single ship could put out
and he would have escaped had it not been for the raging storm
as soon as he was brought ashore the weather turned beautiful and the wind grew peaceful
do you know why i asked why god keeps the gates of the sea barred ?
he requested passage to scotland for himself and his men but i do not like to have such UNknown aboard my vessel
she thought she saw her dead foster sister standing before her
UNknown saw that they were in a room where the UNknown of the tavern had her maid stationed to wash dishes and UNknown
her sister seemed to UNknown her to help wash
the next day the dream UNknown and would not fade
and she was UNknown drawn to the places her foster sister had taken her in the dream
rather than simply standing there you might come in and give me a hand with the dishes
drink my brother !
she could not betray him
he was dear to her heart
she could not send him to be drawn and quartered
she could not bear to see his hands and feet UNknown off
god bless you for coming to see me tonight UNknown
UNknown i have not been to see you for many days since grave thoughts plagued me
but when i happened upon you just now my heart told me what i must to do to be released from my torment
i weep sir archie for the love i bear in my heart for you is too strong
soon the sea will open and ships will be able to set sail to the country from which i come
UNknown won 't you go with me ?
you must go with me UNknown or i will be doomed
tonight i will come for you UNknown
i must have your decision tonight
why are you out here weeping ?
why did you not stay in the cellar ?
i left because i did not wish to hear the words of the evil UNknown on your premises
i happened however to hear three men talking and one said drink my brother sir arne 's treasure is not yet gone
if you can witness such words it is best not to flee
you must go with me to the rightful authorities so they may seize the murderers and duly punish them
the sea has begun to open up to the west
they may even escape to scotland before dawn
go to the inn and settle things
i must speak to UNknown before we depart
sir reginald and philip have gone to the inn while sir archie has gone to UNknown 's cottage
make haste and fly the town guards are after you !
they are looking for the men who murdered sir arne
did you recognize me UNknown and set them upon me ?
they are coming for you
why did you do it sir archie ?
we had been driven mad by hunger and the cold
we were senseless with drink
i did not know what i was doing
why do you betray me just when i UNknown you most ?
do not fear me UNknown
i am again the man i once was
i have returned to my senses
and no harm will befall you on this night either i assure you
using UNknown as a shield sir archie ran for the door
a wild wolf of the woods she had loved
an evil murderer she UNknown with her own body
and as sir archie took another step the pike plunged into UNknown 's heart
all night long the skipper paced the deck of his UNknown
who could know what possessed the skipper to be out on such a night as this
his crew was safely aboard ship and so were the passengers destined for scotland
it was not until dawn 's early light that the skipper saw the sight he was longing for
UNknown and sounds were now open far out to sea
but the inlet where his ship was iced in showed no channels it was frozen solid
i implore you to help me find the maid whom the UNknown brought to your ship last night
last night she was abducted by the men who killed sir arne and they brought her to your ship
the town guard will not venture out this far
not to a ship carrying a hundred soldiers of fortune
they are unwilling to engage them in battle
now i know why we have been held back while all other ships may put to sea
it is because we have UNknown on board
stay calm and obey that man
this is the will of god
as soon as the criminals were brought to shore the storm began to rage again
and from his lofty UNknown point of deck the skipper saw a lengthy procession approach his skip
it was the UNknown of UNknown both young and old
they were clad in mourning and UNknown men carried a UNknown
they had come to collect the young maiden who had loved an UNknown and had given her life to destroy him
and in their wake the tempest tore up the ice over UNknown they had but lately passed
by the time they reached UNknown with UNknown the gates of the sea stood open
the score was co written by UNknown bye and fredrik UNknown UNknown
sir arne 's treasure was restored by the swedish film institute archive in 2000
the original UNknown were UNknown and footage discovered in london and copenhagen has been restored
it was altered by film UNknown several times
at UNknown moscow a UNknown fragment 65 meters
at the german federal film archive and 777 meters of an american version at the library of congress
the colors of the latter fragment have begun to UNknown
unfortunately approximately one third of the film is considered to be lost
this reconstruction tries to follow the film 's original concept closely
we therefore UNknown the order of particular scenes or UNknown and we added new UNknown
the reconstruction was UNknown in accordance with the UNknown and practices of the film 's time
virtually nothing remains of the
living titles mentioned by all contemporary reviews
there are a few examples in the fragment of the american version and in one german UNknown
what does it mean ?
poor little thing without any water
it is dying dying
beware you peoples shaken by nervous UNknown and terror and panic
or by wild UNknown lust

for the sake of his son dr armstrong bore with superhuman energy the horrible suffering and distress which the withdrawal from opium causes

but richard neglected his profession for reasons which no one suspected
in a foolhardy ride alone he sought forgetfulness and an end
help me to become a new man !
i want to be able to face my son without shame

my fifth blackout in a week
it 's the fatigue
his health is in jeopardy
he could die if
it 's the fever
his health is in jeopardy
he could die if
that might persuade him to request a discharge
i 'm writing this in secret because she doesn 't want him to leave france for her as she UNknown puts it
what his health couldn 't accomplish his filial feeling did
jean discharged returned home
you 'r e sick too aren 't you ?
i 'm just very weary
all i want is to go to sleep listening to you read one of your poems the way you used to
my poem about the UNknown ?
the one about silence ?
the UNknown to the sun ?
so she could take to her grave his UNknown of light he sought to finish his UNknown
but all he found was the sadness of the twilight haunted by edith 's gentle spirit
war kills as much the mothers as the sons
i accuse !
i UNknown l be there
dear papa come to jean UNknown 's UNknown
i UNknown l be there
what 's this
i hid in the barn but the soldiers found me
there were several of them
wouldn 't francois kill her if he saw her
i knew that he wasn 't around and i thought that madame diaz would protect my child later
isn 't that so jean ?
my father 's sudden departure frightens me !
he has such a violent nature
i 'm going home
my dear child honor is an old tradition among us
i will try to avenge this UNknown affront
in any case i could never stand that child 's presence
jean will help you bear your pain
francois must never find out never never
if he does i just know he UNknown l kill her
i UNknown l teach you how to become french
then you can find your own way to punish your father as he deserves
how he loves me to make my tragedy more important than his own
the first french lesson
my wife 's come back !
looking at me with such sorry expressions
he left the night edith came home
a distant relative left little angle with me
after four years of sacrifice a brute can become a man a man like jean diaz perhaps
and francois suffered in silence because edith hadn 't noticed
chance does not like secrets
you kissed a child just now
yes little angle
any harm in that
they say you come to kiss her every day
that bothers me a little
my poor edith thank you
i didn 't know you see
my heart is possessed
oh i forgot to tell you
there 's been quite a tragedy here
little angle the child you kissed the other day with jean
is this true ?
that was your child
protect me !
he 's coming
admit it you wretches or prove your innocence !
is your silence formal proof that you 'r e the child 's father
she 's my UNknown mine alone !
let go of jean
can you prove it ?
UNknown UNknown father unknown
i UNknown l leave as soon as i can so as not to commit a crime
there are others i have to kill in exchange for her life !

help me find a way out
sir former officer discharged for health reasons
i now request permission to return to active duty in my old company with the rank of private 2nd class under the orders of sergeant francois UNknown
be brave !
end of part two
hearing the call of the UNknown of justice hearts united suddenly and poor mud UNknown bodies moved toward him like tanks
he knew how to speak to them with UNknown images that UNknown energy and made them clutch their rifles harder
beside every frenchman there is always a gaul
i accuse those who are asleep
hang on a bit longer fellows
victory is here
the gaul told me so
come on men !
and the UNknown told them many other things
profound and painful things which mustn 't emerge from the mud through images because the eyes are still too far from the heart to truly understand
and back there !
francois 's wife jean 's lover maria UNknown 's daughter
UNknown le 's mother
they say nothing but re read the last letter
my dear edith
you 'r e the one she loves

while the living marched to the music
the unknown dead
i fled this innumerable flock
i 'm here to warn you
they 'r e coming
the UNknown and UNknown heroic dead

if you UNknown e been faithful to your dead you have nothing to fear

i accuse !
i accuse !
when the north wind blows at night can 't you hear the millions of death rattles

the bad who survive will only be better for it
may a good flame raise you up
and rather than weep that i have lost the day
think that one never dies when he dies in this way
don 't pain them by calling them
let them go
they were glad to see you again
they 'r e going back to their peaceful sleep knowing that you UNknown e all been worthy of their death
they again took up their crosses which now became lighter

you ve not heard ?
l m the choice of the people
give us barabbas they said
give me some food
how does it feel ?
how did you feel when they told you ?
the choice of the people eh ?
old sara here dropping tears so fast all the UNknown wine got watered
where did you get your luck ?
what witch gave you that ?
pass him across to me !
touch him for luck
fetch her down here
she s completely changed l m telling you
what s wrong with her ?
bring her down
she thinks of nothing day or night except this prophet from nazareth who s on trial for blasphemy
ever since she heard him preach she has gone off her life like a sick child goes off its food
come on you old empty belly
there s no food inside you worth UNknown
sit down and eat
take my word for it
as morbid as a crow in a chimney
bewitched by a prophet
and she s gone to his trial looking like a widow already
she knows what happened to her prophet
that s the end of him
condemned was he ?
how do you like that ?
the idol of the city
tell you what
they call the prophet king of the jews but they chose you
show your respects to king barabbas
let s have a crowning of him
what are you doing ?
come on give him his robes
you be nice to your king barabbas
more wives than solomon and his subjects as ripe as old UNknown
here s your UNknown
what s that ?
kneel down all you miserable scum of the earth and acknowledge
kneel down you scum of the earth
i crown you king barabbas
what are you treating me like a clown for ?
here she is barabbas if you want her
look here rachel look who s been asking for you
the old rascal back from the dead
so here she is
why don t you look at me ?
barabbas let me go
i wouldn t wish any man his death
what do you mean by that ?
don t make me speak to you
what do you mean by that ?
don t make me speak to you
that s a warm welcome
i couldn t follow any further
i daren t say what is still to come but god forgive us all if he can
what did i tell you ?
she s no good to you now barabbas
what s the matter ?
remember how it used to be
barabbas don t you see what s happening ?
don t you understand what set you free ?
i just got out of prison
i need to get the cramp out of my bones
that s what s happened
l m not the same
nothing is the same
barabbas listen to me
he came from god the man who s taking your place
you think i should have been killed instead of him ?
you think i ought to be dead ?
barabbas hear what i say
he came from god
god can look after his own
and you can look after me
she s got her head full of them
well it seems she s got something to think about now anyway
i don t like the look of it
look of what ?
l ve never known it dark like this in the middle of the day
get a light for mercy s sake
something s wrong with my eyes
i can t see
am i going blind ?
what s happening ?
even the light has left us now that we ve killed him
well are you satisfied now ?
he s dead
we ve seen it
he promised to come back
we shall see that too
only two days and he il be in the world again
look at his friends
i tell you you re mad
that s the end of it
not tomorrow but the morning after
how many days have i been here ?
how many days have i been here ?
can t you hear me ?
what s the matter with you ?
what s the matter ?
two and one make three
what s so odd ?
we il see then
barabbas where are you going ?
now you know it s true
all i know is the tomb is empty
who moved the stone ?
god moved it
a power came from the sky
it was when the sun was rising at the beginning of the day
first there was the music of a horn
the whole sky seemed to UNknown
it was white it was fire
it was white fire
it seemed as long as a spear
the point of the spear went between the stone and the rock and the stone rolled away
lf only you had been here sooner and seen what i saw
my eyes are good
you have to believe this barabbas
the master was a man of truth and he said this would be so
did you see a prophet come out of the tomb ?
my eyes were so dazzled
i think i must have covered them
but when i could see again a man and a woman were together in the garden
then the woman was alone
and then she went quickly away
and the man was the same man they buried in there ?
he was like a shadow
the morning light was behind him
but l m sure it was he
shadows light that s about the truth of it
here s the truth of it
why do you think he should lie about himself when it meant he would be killed ?
how do you know what he said ?
the priests ought to know more than you do
and they call it blasphemy
where are you going ?
there are those who can tell you more
there s a house in the street of the UNknown where they meet
you may find them there
go and ask them
they took the body and hid it to go on with their story
or are you afraid ?
are you afraid of knowing what has happened ?
are you looking for someone ?
you like to see it ?
the clay making itself ?
some other day
the tomb s empty the women said they saw him
creed can have strange visions
only it s true
don t open it
wiser to go down to galilee
can we hide from the future forever ?
let s see what is here
what if they mean to destroy us all ?
leaving no one to tell the knowledge of the man
can the word turn to silence ?
l m not afraid of that
where is he ?
what do you want with us ?
you know what i mean
what are you all afraid of ?
what are we afraid of ?
you want to know what we want to know
what is the truth of this morning ?
i know the truth
but something else has happened
lf you find him here it will only be if he comes himself
through that gate as you did just now
don t you believe it
i saw the body
lf you were sure of that you wouldn t be here
he s risen
you re all mad
there s no sea to fish in closer than galilee
lt s what l m used to doing my hands go to it
but the streets in the cities have to be the sea for me now
he made a joke about it when he took us away from the boats
he said that in the future our fish would be men
it was a serious joke
it meant he d given us the word to draw men out of the dark sea into the light
and you call yourself a fisherman ?
do i have to tell you what happens to the fish ?
they struggle about gasp and die
we struggle and gasp
that s where men have the advantage over fish
they can die to the world die to the dark sea and begin to live again in the light
that s what he promised and what he promised has happened
but what has happened we still don t know
he s come back to life
he il lead us to the new kingdom
l il believe it when he s before us
when i can touch him and hear him
you re always full of doubts without any cause
no cause to doubt that a dead man can come back to life ?
the master brought him back to life
thomas knows him well
here s someone wants to question you
you can ask him whatever you like
they told me death is not
ls not death
because you were dead and were raised from the dead by the man
i mean the master
what s it like there ?
you were there
what is it ?
you want me to tell you about the realm of the dead ?
to those who ve been there nothing else is anything either
no one has asked me this before
they have listened how life came back to me and gone away praising
only you have asked about death
and none the wiser
sharing his body
leave me alone
lt s no good thinking
come on let s go and find a new life
where are you going barabbas ?
to see what brought back to life means
love one another !
lt s not my fault they let him get killed
you can t hang it around my neck
l ve as much right to be alive as any of you
you stinking fish
you look at me
today or tomorrow
every day you have promised us it has never come
it will never come
you d better mind what you say
don t you know what can happen to you if they hear you ?
anybody now caught spreading such stories the son of god the messiah and such is to be judged an enemy of the state and stoned until he s dead
it will be as though the earth has become like a star burned clean
everything evil swept away
white like their own
pain and sorrow will sink into the ground and everything will be made new because the son of god has risen from the dead
the world has become his kingdom
there s no truth in any of it
i know this woman
don t you listen to her
she s UNknown up trouble
nothing but trouble
he knows but is afraid to believe it
look at you barabbas
it will happen whether you take part in it or not
he s right lt s dangerous talk
they il pull down our homes drive us out
better listen to this man
let s hear what the prophet said
don t leave
to where the lepers are to tell them to be ready for the freedom that s coming
she s going among the lepers !
stop her !
don t let her go among the lepers !
don t let her set the lepers free !
you have no right to go among the lepers !
look out it s a temple guard !
we don t want the lepers to be free !
a charge has been lodged against this woman
she must be questioned
bring her to the temple and we will judge her
take your dirty hands off her
don t take her !
she s done no wrong
don t take her away
for stirring up evil matters among the people for misleading their minds and denying the wisdom of authority
for her sins she has been condemned to death by UNknown
let the man who accused her and was found just in his accusation cast the first stone
what must i do ?
take this stone
l ve nothing against her
you accused her
it was you
throw quickly lf you wait i may be afraid
you don t have to think of barabbas any more
he s not coming back
and if he did we d know what to do with him
you re still afraid of him because he used to roar at you like a brass bull
you can t stand up to him even when he s gone
he s gone to the devil once and for all i can tell you
he s lost his nerve
he s creeping about the city like a shivering priest
why do you think he s not come back ?
because he s afraid to stir hand or foot
we don t know yet he won t come back
who cares if he does ?
we got a man here who can hang him in his own guts
he came out of that prison mad
acquitted but mad
so you remembered the way to get here
given you up this past week
you il find things altered
what s over is over
i remembered the way
the money is sacred !
it belongs to the temple !
the god of battle will destroy you !
what are you doing ?
here s all the treasure we wanted
come away !
it seemed to me at the time barabbas when you were given your liberty before it wasn t a fortunate exchange
they were calling for death and disorder when they called your name
this is what i thought and this is what has occurred
they put the scourge back into the fist
by that i mean you and your life
and many men have suffered and died in consequence
the other man too
this is a local matter which i hope will soon be adjusted
the shock and fear of an UNknown UNknown will pass
but the appetite to destroy which alas the human being shares with the wild beast is always with us
and it has UNknown to be disciplined in the name of civilization
and according to the law
that s what you say
but i tell you whichever side of the law we re on we re the same men
you and your kind and me and my kind
how else have you lived except my way ?
what we haven t got we go out and take
let him speak
whoever s against us or gets in our way we get rid of
my knife may have bitten a few throats but what about your weapons ?
they ve split thousands upon thousands
lf l ve taken a passing woman to myself your armies have looted and raped across continents
and have been called the glory of the earth for doing it
you were born according to the law and raised according to the law
i was born by a girl thrown out of a brothel who gave birth and cursed me before she died
but i tell you we belong to the same herd
unfortunately for you barabbas the law is indispensable
the law is the pass and permit to life in this world
you were without it
you can t kill me ?
easier on you if we could
i sentence you to transportation for life whatever that s worth to the sulfur mines on the island of sicily
i can t be killed
he meant me to live
deliberately he did it
the death has been paid
he s taken my death
that s it
that light that wasn t light
the dark that wasn t dark
that wasn t dark that was life
that was life
l ve got my life and you can t take it !
you stinking fish !
l ve got my life !
well which are you ?
l m UNknown
the divine emperor tiberius
what are they doing ?
they re sending us down to the next level to make room for you
that s how you know how long you ve been here by how deep you re down
they break you in gradually to get used to the dark
did it take long ?
you re blind
better learn from him
who was emperor then ?
that s mine
you don t care how i got here but l il tell you
the ship i was serving on took on a cargo of slaves
some of them got free
slipped over the side during my watch
so the captain put the chains on me
what about your world ?
what s your name ?
i asked you what your name is
what is that to you ?
chained to you of all men on earth
that s what i like to see devils and beasts going for each other s throats
here s a head of you to hate each other
now work you crazy dogs
let s see you working
you weren t even in jerusalem but you hate my name
that s right
what does it matter to you ?
you know who was killed in your place ?
still that ?
i thought what he said was to love one another
i can t imagine he expects a man to have a spirit as strong and patient as a UNknown horse
it was only something i was told
lf you think i got the best of it you stay here for a generation or two
we ve got a special duty for you two
this il show you what happens to fighting UNknown
that s what i don t understand
who s been spreading things about ?
keeping that tale alive all these years ?
what could kill it ?
when you think it was god s will come to earth to show what he is
i can see the reality of that
which is why the name of the master goes on growing in the world
i began to meet it wherever i sailed
UNknown cyprus greece
i began to understand what it meant
but it s a tough demand the will of god
l m a poor hand at it
and look where l ve got us now
even though l ve got his sign scratched on the back of the emperor s head
it means i belong to him not to the emperor
lt s the sign he has put on us all if we give way enough to see it
look at this
keep your god to yourself
why did you come here and rake up old lies about killing god ?
what s going on down there ?
move yourselves or l il leave you to rot
you re the only man l ve met who saw him
you were there at the beginning and you won t talk
you won t tell me
what are you afraid of ?
nothing l m afraid of
then you can tell me
you see the darkness that went over heaven and earth when he died ?
suppose i did
suppose his tomb was empty
can t a dead man be taken away ?
you want the truth ? l il give it to you
that s all of your god you il get out of me
here what s the matter ?
come on get up
get on your feet
you two get your feet on the ground
get out of there
you ve had enough sleep now
get on your feet i say
one dead man here
now come on
what s the matter with you ?
you can t stand up ?
can t work ?
how many survivors ?
it was like the end of the world to them
the end of the underworld
what did you say sir ?
i can taste the salt in the air
every breath of wind is full of the sea
i thought i could never love it better than i did
but oh glory !
now are you glad to live ?
salt me down and l d praise god even for this
how many times were you swindled in those foreign ports ?
you must ve been the easiest game they ever got their hands on
why is that ?
one smile and you trust the world that half kills you
yes i trust it
god should make himself plain or leave me alone
am i the one who lets himself be swindled or you ?
every time he came near you refused to believe it
but it s never been out of your mind
what other man s death could have troubled you so long ?
rock to be carried
now will you leave me in peace ?
all right we go on
send for them UNknown
bring those men over here to us
very good sir
two men so strangely come up from the underworld
twenty years in the mines the old one
what are your names ?
what does it matter ?
lndeed what should it matter ?
we understand you mean to live forever
i must touch them for the luck that s in them
my wife thinks your merit is contagious
all right we don t want to hold up the work
it seems the gods approve your superstition
we re to call to rome
to rome ?
l m to enter the senate
we re to rise in the world
a good thing i touched them
i see their success not mine
nothing but amiable days from now on and knowing everybody instead of nobody
when shall we go ?
ride with us l il give you the answer
how wretched to arrive when all have gone to the mountains
look over there
what do you mean ?
why do we come here ?
they cannot fight yet
and so they will
let s hope they won t disgrace us
when a charmed life turns professional we can expect great things
UNknown the commander
our happiness is all here commander
there s the third staff of liberty in his hand
always he prefers to come back
he knows his empire and has the sense to keep it
keep it he does
UNknown the senator UNknown and his lady
l il take this life
can t a man be made mad by the smell of blood ?
a man can understand this
to throw the net hold it to your right like this
then throw from the tips of your fingers like this
your places now
now start your practice
the gray haired one ?
they say there s something remarkable about him
nothing can kill him
what do we do with aging fish grandfather ?
lt s time he was thrown to the UNknown
let me be
you remember me ?
how did you know i carried the sign ?
several days l ve watched you breaking the bread
can we speak freely ?
he was there in jerusalem
he knew the master
the days have been getting darker for us
seldom enough i find my way there some way off to the UNknown
the UNknown ?
it may seem to you that the faith is buried
but so is the seed before there can be a harvest
first group assemble
first group assemble
and from above you there the white cloth will be thrown into the arena
when it touches the ground the contest will begin
to make sure you understand this is the way it will happen
kill him !
they want blood
lf the emperor were here he wouldn t have had a choice
wait till tomorrow
not one life will he get from me
won t he ?
he will teach you the ways
when he says death death it is
the true god says life
i only answer to him
hark at this man
who do you call your god ?
the only one
put em down
what revenge will mars take ?
none at all
what do you mean he doesn t exist ?
will you keep your mouth shut ?
the real god is greater than any man s thoughts can imagine
he made life as deep and strong as the sea
your gods are as shallow as a UNknown pond
he s above us and around us in us
like the breath in our bodies
and he has one law that will break our pattern
the law is love
and so that we should see what his love is he sent his son to live the life of a man
to show that god understands the life he has made
who spun you this ?
what do you want us to do ?
what good will he do us in the arena ?
we il lose the goodwill of the gods we know
tomorrow in the arena show the emperor that we know what life s worth
throw away your weapons
lf anything s beyond belief that is
god said burn away the old world and let a new one rise from the ashes
as the son of god rose from the dead he died for us
ask barabbas here the truth of what i tell you
he saw with his own eyes the son of god when he lived among us
saw him die
you saw him barabbas ?
tell us what you saw
what happened ?
some people say he was
the son of god
you re both under arrest
take them out and put them in chains
move now !
not only with holding views UNknown by the state for which the punishment is death but of recommending those views to men sworn to the state s service
what is more you ve betrayed your faith to me who brought you to this city and laid me under possible suspicion of UNknown in the eyes of the emperor
the prospect is black for you
you know what this is ?
the stamp of the roman state
which means that you re rome s property
what s this cut here ?
the sign of my master
who do you call your master ?
the one who is my lord
the son of the father
ln other words the christian sign ?
a religion which sets itself up to menace government and order
which denies the divine authority of the emperor
which UNknown that the slave is equal to the free man and would reduce society to anarchy
a rebellious insufferable UNknown
do you belong to the state ?
i belong to the lord my god
so you also believe in this god ?
tell me do you ?
you don t ?
lsn t he your god ?
lsn t that what the inscription means ?
i have no god
because i tried to believe
l il give you the opportunity to recover your senses
lf you il admit publicly to the men you spoke to that all these things were lies you may save your life
will you do this ?
that would be to lose my life not save it
what i am is his
but isn t life dear to you ?
yes it is
what do you choose ?
i choose my god
guilty of the charge
you come here
it may be the master means you to live
he may have some greater need of you
some other purpose barabbas
you may go
kill him !
for your remarkable UNknown in life we have a traditional answer to this public UNknown
we make you a free man
we give you your liberty
here is the symbol of your freedom
i brought him to you
this is where he would have wanted to be buried
our brother UNknown
did he have to die before you cared about him ?
are you more concerned with his body than his life ?
you were willing to let him go to his death alone
why should you help him now he doesn t need you ?
how could i have helped him by being killed ?
he made his own death
what good has it done ?
i had to go on living he said
there was something i still had to do
barabbas why should you believe it ?
when the light shone you wouldn t accept it
when the dark came you denied it
when the spirit of god UNknown you refused it
when UNknown says your life is kept for some purpose why should you believe it ?
to make a gag for your conscience is that it ?
you believe it because it suits you
or maybe if UNknown stood before you now then you would say you believed
you would repent and love god
it would be easy
what would it matter ?
jesus of nazareth was killed instead of me
there must have been a reason
why me ?
where have you gone ?
show me the way ! l m lost !
which way shall i go ?
what s happening ?
rome is burning
the christians tried to burn down rome
lt s the christians !
the new kingdom is coming
what are you doing madman ?
fire of god destroying the old world
the hour has come when all is to perish
are you a christian ?
yes i am
the whole world will soon be UNknown
do you hear that ?
we re burning the way
we re ready for his coming
take him away
let me go !
here s one of your kind who was caught in the act setting light to a storehouse
he admits he s a christian burning the city to start a new kingdom
the only honest man among you
who are you ?
ls it true ?
who are you ?
this isn t how the new kingdom is going to be made
you were wrong
many years ago we spoke together
you remember ?
you were mistaken of us then as you are again now
we didn t set fire to the city
you ve done the work of the wild beast the emperor
are you a lunatic ?
it was his fire you fool not god s
why can t god make himself plain ?
what s become of all the fine hopes ?
the trumpets the angels ?
all the promises ?
all for nothing
or do you think that what has battered on your soul for twenty years has been nothing ?
it wasn t for nothing that christ died
mankind isn t nothing
he loves each man as though there were no other
i was the opposite of everything he taught wasn t l ?
why did he let himself be killed instead of me ?
because being UNknown from him you were the nearest
l m no nearer than i was before
nor any farther away
i can tell you this
there has been a wrestling in your spirit back and forth in your life which in itself is knowledge of god
by the conflict you have known him
i can tell you as well that so it will be with the coming of the kingdom
that wrestling back and forth and the UNknown of the world spirit like a woman in childbirth
we are only the beginning
we won t see the time when the earth is full of the kingdom
and yet even now even here we are at the end ourselves
the kingdom is within us
there is nothing more to fear
upon us the years will be built
many years many UNknown
but men will look back to us in our day and will wonder and remember our hope
it is the end of the day
we shall trust ourselves to a little pain and sleep
saying to the world
night or day ?
it is barabbas
are you injured ?
the police set up a security zone to protect the UNknown life
as partisans UNknown break through this security zone they were killed outright by the special forces team
the police assume this incident could be UNknown the same UNknown splinter group which was apparently using such disturbance throughout the UNknown own purposes
why these partisans were wearing japanese UNknown uniforms is still UNknown
may 1800 the last UNknown year of the king
officer huang is there UNknown no UNknown out ?
have you considered all other possibilities ?
majesty i am heartbroken
your power in the state has been weakened UNknown long by intrigue UNknown and now i too am powerless
i UNknown for my weakness my dear king
there is but one thing i can do
i UNknown you save yourselves your highness save the queen UNknown unborn prince of the crown
you must consider getting yourselves as quickly as possible to the gate of time highness
only then will your safety be UNknown !
no i have to stay with my people even if it costs me my life
officer huang no one can be allowed to find out about the gate of time
it must be kept secret at all costs !
of course your excellency !
general i have been UNknown stars
something very unusual has appeared in the heavens above korea
the people are calling it the dragon star
dragon star ?
i beg UNknown noble UNknown my UNknown to speak with you
the emperor does not wish to dispatch UNknown in this case
do you understand ?
this is a UNknown mission
the emperor has entrusted us with this UNknown UNknown must not disappoint him
the future of our land depends on it we will do our best
i UNknown we UNknown l be away for a very UNknown
you alone will carry UNknown
i will not be able to help you !
you need not worry
i realize my fighting skills are meaningless next to yours and i will be very unhappy when you are far away from me nevertheless don 't underestimate me
this is our destiny
i wont let you down
majesty i know that there is no UNknown i have done the secret of the gate of time was UNknown taken from me UNknown i have UNknown my life
UNknown the son of UNknown bodyguard loved the queen for as long as he UNknown but had never UNknown to her
he buried his feelings deep in his heart UNknown go through the gate of time to try to forget his unlucky love in UNknown
the japanese UNknown wanted to UNknown fulfillment of the UNknown at all costs
and UNknown it UNknown the king UNknown fight for his land
he believed in his UNknown and didn 't lament his decision
his only concern was his wife UNknown unborn child
the future of korea could depend on their survival
the king UNknown his wife to his own bodyguard yun and UNknown son UNknown
the UNknown UNknown and his father to UNknown queen UNknown unborn prince safely into UNknown
the gate of time was an ancient UNknown protected secret of UNknown dynasty and no one had UNknown it for many generations
before engaging in his last fight the king gave his unborn son the name bin which UNknown meaning
educated in all sciences and skillful in handling a sword and if the child UNknown out to be a girl she would be called UNknown
the dragon star now stands in the direction south east we must hurry !
stop stop !
i know of UNknown that we are bearing father and i won 't disappoint the king
highness we must hurry
UNknown to heaven
hey don 't you want to dance ?
come on !
UNknown what 's the matter ?
come on UNknown !
there are days where i feel as though
i 'm wrapped in a cocoon of cotton wool UNknown UNknown a veil
and sometimes it feels like
i can 't really explain it but sometimes i see human forms circling around me from the corner of my eye
i have no idea what they want from me UNknown UNknown when i try to look closely
that sounds completely crazy doesn 't it ?
sometimes i seem to lose the connection UNknown
i feel as though i have lived once before a UNknown ago
if only someone would lift the veil that seems to lie over my life
i don 't really know who i am and my UNknown are scaring me
noble UNknown in the years past i have UNknown acted on gods will
i have known from the beginning that you would come back
have you lost the others ?
you were not alone where are they ?
you need not worry about them the others are all dead
you there is someone !
go check it out !
what the hell is that ?
i UNknown e got to have a look
hey what 's that guy doing here ask him what the hell he wants
don 't worry about it i UNknown l take care of this idiot
how have you gotten by in the last years ?
life has been difficult noble UNknown
we have been UNknown UNknown
i have been UNknown korean warriors forthe last ten years
UNknown years UNknown we have been unsuccessful
as long as i UNknown e been here we have killed every boy child who was born on the same day as the prince
but bin has always survived
and every year on the princes birthday the dragon star shines especially bright

two years had already passed and your death was already obvious
i leave all my estate to my legitimate wife
UNknown UNknown n e UNknown whom i married in the church of saint nicholas on the 5th of august of the current year
you can find the proof of my marriage in the archives of the church of saint nicholas
it was when that i knew about the consequences of my action and i began my UNknown to UNknown but i had your death on my conscience
do you think i UNknown l continue with this farce ?
you made me a criminal and now you present yourself as innocent
john almost daily he forced himself on me and one day
you think that because one day i was conveniently there
i am forced to watch your every step ?
luck let me find you and i properly treated you as my sister in law
UNknown is insane
i took my son to my mother 's home
on my way there i got a telegram from john saying i could not escape his claws
the rest you already know
won 't you forgive me ?
a second landslide covers them further
i UNknown l see if i can catch that bandit
you go to the cabin
on the way back with his back turned
return to the world with me george and we will start a new life
i won 't return to the world until that stone virgin starts walking
i made this vow and i will fulfill it
i entrust to you a saved soul and i hope you know how to take care of her
UNknown sent for her mother and son to join her in the mountains
if you weren 't the wife of the late george UNknown who in his will didn 't reveal his marriage all his fortune would have gone to me
so it was my fault that you cease to be the UNknown heir ?
can i deny this pleasure to the man who saved my life ?
dear god what am i to do ?
do you have the right not to help a woman in the greatest of her trials ?
if you are in fact the holy mary as people call you then release me from my vow
the angel of the poor
a storm at the mountain
give me this innocent
and she came down to the field
holy mary in the snow
after the storm the end

they don 't need top diplomats at the folies berg re
we UNknown e got a job to do and we 'r e going to do it
and we 'r e going to do it better than anybody else
they 'r e like indians
they think they 'r e dealing with children
of course this is all very hush hush
something for everyone
you know how it is
the right dinner parties
naturally my presence in washington will be essential
sir i understand and i won 't let you down
i 'm tempted to leave mr UNknown in charge but i don 't think that would look very good image wise
dad sir i realize that my record at various UNknown has been less than perfect but what can go wrong in two weeks ?
you were in brazil for two weeks and you had them UNknown coffee
no see that was my own son who i raised to be a diplomat
was asked to leave africa
don 't get worked up dad
some of the best men in foreign service have at one time or another been asked to leave a country
africa is a continent
i 'm not really a natural at it like you are
you were hung in UNknown in panama !
even i didn 't know that
i told you that
dad you UNknown e been more than tolerant
i realize i UNknown e had a hard time finding myself
now i realize there 's some UNknown in our experience and i don 't want that to cause any UNknown or resentment
i intend to run a disciplined ship but a fair one
now the word around here is that you don 't really approve of me
am i to believe that ?
you can speak freely
totally UNknown to the diplomatic corps
UNknown to the task of fighting communism
clinging desperately to a disastrous career through the good graces of your father 's connections
in short despite your family 's advantages a born failure
you know it 's refreshing when someone despises you to hear it UNknown so UNknown
he 's arriving with a few more in his UNknown than we expected but
dad we converted the library into
now dad everything is fine
who else would wear these clothes ?
i 'm fine !
you know good people
they were caught in the act of spying
no one will be dragged out and shot
leave the premises at once
this is an extreme violation of international conduct
i 'm axel UNknown
guns or no guns if you don 't go mr UNknown will throw you out
i can 't commit to anything without the facts
this will all be settled !
you invade our sanctity with weapons ?
you wonder how a brutal dictatorship gets a bad name
okay that 's enough
you can 't be UNknown !
i wasn 't UNknown
our government has a fixed policy regarding espionage
did you tell them we 'r e spies ?
they said we 'r e spies
they say we 'r e spies
how can i spy ?
with my eyesight i 'm gonna be a spy ?
i didn 't tell them you were spies
first rule mr UNknown keep your options open
first no movie on the plane now this
this is all just a simple misunderstanding
how simple ?
is that simple enough ?
first there 'd be like a show trial then they 'd shoot you
who is this guy ?
perhaps we should notify ambassador UNknown
that will not be necessary
a man takes his family on a vacation and this is what we have working in our government
then they wonder why i don 't vote
i have done nothing wrong here
you knew it was forbidden
i didn 't think they 'd see
i have a UNknown
i thought it was lunch break
what did you photograph ?
leave me alone because i got a headache
they 'r e paranoid and you 'r e a UNknown for the whole trip
you know he 's right
he is right
every time i listen to what you say i wind up behind the eight ball
here we go again
he wants to take his family someplace
i said we UNknown l get a UNknown in atlantic beach
every year it has to be atlantic beach ?
to what ?
no this is better
what 's so terrible ?
my brother suggested we see europe
he had a wonderful time
i have to live for her brother
do you hear this ?
that 's a hot one
i know you folks are excited
yes mr and mrs walter UNknown
newark new jersey
the facts are i get a vacation
i want to take my family someplace
so i say we UNknown l go to atlantic beach
we UNknown l swim
we gotta go to UNknown
and we must he tells us we must go behind the iron curtain
meanwhile on his vacation he went to the french riviera
aren 't you interested to see how the other half lives ?
we went with you to the crazy horse in paris
a striptease joint
are you comparing communism to those girls ?
as if he appreciates europe anyway
we took him to westminster abbey his feet hurt
we took him to buckingham palace he tried to make the guards laugh
we took him to the UNknown chapel he never saw the UNknown
the UNknown 's on the ceiling
i can 't look up
i get dizzy
in the louvre
i turn away for one minute he 's caressing the bosom
she cannot take a joke
the man is caressing the bosom
yes i felt the statue
she cannot take a joke
have either you ever had any stomach ailments or UNknown problems ?
what is he doing ?
i have this brother you see i have this brother
he should be wearing an UNknown
take my word for it
here we go
what do i need asylum ?
i 'm gonna need your passports and i gotta get some other information
i 'm giving information
he 's quite a lovely individual
they should have hung him at nuremberg
have you ever bought anything on credit ? what the hell is this ?
what is what i what are we doing here ?
a man goes on a vacation this is crazy
you know here
that 's fine
take my card
no no sir
she 's a professional mah UNknown UNknown
she travels around with her own tiles in a case
okay now you UNknown snapped some photos ?
his sense of direction is terrible
what are you telling him this for ?
will you listen to me mr UNknown ?
he starts out driving to the UNknown
and he winds up in the UNknown
she has all the answers
then they started to chase you and you had the good sense to come here
my daughter had the presence of mind
it 's a good thing she did
so you could tell her we 'r e spies cause you don 't deny it
i didn 't say anything
my wife should not have to go through this
she 's not a young woman
what do you mean i 'm an old woman ?
i 'm not saying old
you 'r e not old but she had bridge work recently
look i just don 't think there 's anything to worry about
sure UNknown UNknown i 'm a UNknown not a spy
creative catering is our specialty
we were the first to make the UNknown out of potato salad
he does lovely work
last month we did an affair
i made the bridegroom from potato salad
the head was a UNknown mold and there was a clam dip that we did the rest of the body in
fruit punch spouting
a few days ?
i 'm not gonna stay here a few days
we UNknown l have mr burns set up some UNknown
i can 't sleep on a cot
i 'm a dignified human being with a UNknown
mr UNknown this is an emergency
we 'r e gonna try the best we can okay ?
no i can 't stay here
this is the height of the season
sam UNknown can 't run the business without me
look he 's a wonderful man
i have respect for him
he 's my partner
it UNknown l be all right
alvin UNknown l come in
his son UNknown l come in
he 's over 21
he 's dumber than his father
i 'm sure the business can wait a couple of days
folks that 's it for me
i 'm sorry if i damaged anything but now i 'm going to america
mr UNknown what do you think 's gonna happen ?
i 'm a UNknown
this is preposterous
mr UNknown you can 't just go out there
you know what ?
you think i 'm afraid to go out ?
i 'm afraid no
they 'r e only police
they UNknown l arrest you torture you
what 's to be afraid of ?
yeah i 'm afraid
i urge you not to do anything rash
let him go
good bye !
ach you 'r e starting with the UNknown
the UNknown !
like 1 2 armies all with their guns drawn
you 'r e all right ?
yeah i 'm fine ma
i 'm fine
she was a UNknown
two three days ?
the kid UNknown l be home
he UNknown l be UNknown
we 'r e here
he UNknown l be running UNknown
he UNknown l be UNknown and looting
this kid takes after her brother
now what ?
that 's what
we 'r e not pushing anything
maybe she 's right
so you better call the owner of the renaissance UNknown and deal with it
what are we talking about ?
he 's been living upstairs for a while
what is a while ?
we UNknown l swim we UNknown l play pinochle
unfortunately they must have discovered the wires
we 'r e getting nothing
they don 't appear to be spies
they look like a family
leaks now can prove fatal
once in our possession the UNknown will talk
and then heads will roll
so then they shot at walter and we raced down the block
they 'r e horrible communists with secret police and those vicious dogs and
no it 's really a beautiful place carol
they set up these kind of fold out beds for us in this conference room library
you 'd love mr UNknown
he 's really very attractive
don 't even ask me that question
then i get all confused
the UNknown come back
i want you to go i want you to go into my bedroom and look under my pillow
look under the pillow
i want you to take it and wrap it up
i want you to mail it to me
because i 'm under tremendous stress and i know i 'm not gonna be able to sleep unless i have my piece of flannel
yeah piece of flannel
a formal complaint is in order
we have time mr UNknown
then i strongly suggest we cancel plans to host the emir
our arab friends can be unpredictable
i think it would be an extreme loss of face for the emir if he were suddenly not permitted to be our country 's guest
it 's a question of space
the emir will take up the whole third floor
as you wish
everyone 's been really nice
we UNknown l try to get you out of here as soon as we can
we really appreciate it
my da oh
i mean they kind of have a funny way of UNknown with each other
deep down they 'r e affectionate
they really like each other but i don 't know what you see is what i UNknown the huns to be
yeah well you know it 's gotta be hard for them
oh would you like something to drink ?
we UNknown e got a local white wine
it 's uh
oh i could use something serious
uh not a lot
i don 't know
about the universe
that makes it easier
well i travel a lot
suddenly and unexpectedly
mr UNknown said you UNknown e been in almost every embassy
that 's really amazing
you haven 't eaten right ?
look how quickly i 'm talking personally with you
um i don 't i don 't have a UNknown e
that 's all right
i was choking on some cosmo UNknown
it 's actually an interesting story
he reached down my throat and pulled out a toothpick with a half eaten shrimp on the end of it
beverly you heard ?
but if you ask me whoever UNknown doesn 't do a good job
mr UNknown if you have any special request i 'm sure oscar
we are 4 000 miles from the united states
it 's a communist country
it 's 8 00 at night
i can 't get lean UNknown !
oysters lovely oysters
i want my food dead
not sick not wounded
he wants me to eat a UNknown calf 's foot
because of where we are and who we entertain our menu can be a little exotic
so plain boiled chicken
i UNknown l come in the kitchen
i UNknown l make you something
the UNknown i have everything just so
my spice rack
i 'm getting dizzy
i spoke to barney UNknown on the phone
did you tell him not to bother to come to UNknown airport with the station wagon because we may be six years late ?
mrs UNknown i meant to speak to you about the telephone
you 'r e free to use the phone as much as you 'd like but if you could limit the calls
this is nothing for her
let me tell you
i called the UNknown
the UNknown ?
they have orgies
i UNknown one
father UNknown what brings you down here ?
i heard such a commotion today and i met this lovely young lady upstairs
these are the UNknown father UNknown
they came to us today under much the same circumstances you did six years ago
oh you 'r e refugees
if it 's for me so what you don 't go crazy up there ?
mm i 'm a guest through the courtesy of your government
i do not wish to make myself a nuisance
can 't you leave here ?
only if there 's some drastic change in national policy
i have friends who could help me escape but i feel it is my duty to return and someday lead my people once again
but until you lead your people you stay in your bedroom ?
over the years i have developed a hobby
let 's go
how about you ma 'a m ?
pick a card
don 't matter to me
show your brains
five of hearts
don 't you father ?
i raise them
bring some of your things down
i think we 'd all like to see them
so we could watch him

he 's a priest
the one who suffers most gets the promotion
yes thank you
the chef is making you hare

walter and i are wanted
i UNknown this guy i UNknown the newspapers
didn 't you people have an uprising recently ?
i understand the ambassador has made arrangements
i 'm right
there are two sides to that affair my friend
what are you talking about walter ?
something you know nothing about ?
what are you telling me ?
i don 't know politics ?
don 't you read the papers ?
this guy owns the most sand of anyone
we UNknown e had some problems
problems of extreme rudeness ?
what 's your trouble aladdin ?
mr UNknown leave this room immediately
no i 'm not gonna go
i 'm an american citizen
i pay taxes
what has that got to do with anything ?
even with my cheating i UNknown
your excellency i 'm ambassador UNknown 's son
i think your government can decide that for itself
i am the government !
listen to this
for crying out loud
how does he ever get in the bathroom ?
i don 't know how UNknown did it !
i want it undone
axel i knew it
no i think it 's been kept pretty well under wraps
it is a crisis
god save your life if this becomes public
any of it
the last thing i need is to be on the front pages for the wrong thing
i have friends at the pentagon who owe me a favor and they will aim an UNknown at you
i i appreciate that
he didn 't eat dinner tonight
the chef made squid
that 's not good
you all right ?
actually um i UNknown e had the opportunity to do a lot of soul searching
i UNknown e decided not to marry donald
you 'r e kidding
how come ?
he 's a great guy
he 's really brilliant
it 's fine for him i just i don 't know if it 's for me
you don 't need any
well i don 't know
you think ?
this is the rest of my life we 'r e talking about you know ?
that 's true
you phoned him ?
i can 't believe that
it 's my father who 's gonna have a heart attack or a stroke when he finds out
i mean donald he is
he 's the answer to a father 's prayer
how many guys have you gone out with ?
oh just a few
the draft dodger um
he didn 't like that
there was a UNknown depressive jazz musician
my mother loved him
he 's hard to please
he must really hate the suburbs
yes and no
she just said that and i said what 's this special circumstance gonna be ?
and then at trader vic 's when donald pulled the shrimp out of my throat
i figured this is special so i thought it might be him
you know ?
now i have this feeling it might be you
this from a person who listens to fortune UNknown
well me ?
actually the way i see it it 's a once in a lifetime experience
less if you 'r e lucky
i mean you know the UNknown movie writer would never think of having two people meet in an embassy like this
i never really thought about getting married
here we are
well uh do you believe in fortune UNknown ?
i don 't think so
UNknown UNknown i saw this one at a carnival once and she told me i was gonna be the next michelangelo
the next michelangelo
maybe my fortune came true
i wanna take a walk and see the trees and smell the flowers
i can 't see any baseball
i can 't get an egg roll
you know i 'm lost without my UNknown

i 'm not in love with him
and i 'm talking to her
so listen to her
how can you not marry him ?
i don 't know

dad i 'm mixed up

you have to marry him
you 'r e in love with him
so what ?
i don 't know
since i find him very romantic
to you not her
so if i let him hold me in his arms you UNknown l marry him ?
the man is a UNknown
what could be more romantic than a UNknown ?
it 's skin
the very words of his profession are romantic
she 's heavy with child
i 'm not with child !
what are you talking about ?
what do you mean ?
you 'r e not with child ?
i 'm not with child
since when are you not with child ?
she 's never been with child
where 'd i get the impression she was with child ?
i don 't know
my sister 's with child ?
yes i told you
she told me
i don 't know what we 'r e going to get her around here
how do you get a baby gift we UNknown l get it at the duty free shop
by the time we get to a duty free shop the kid 's gonna be in college
you should still marry donald
what 's the difference ?
so you UNknown l adopt
no no that 's not true at all
i heard there 's been some kind of a crisis where american spies have been uncovered by the reds ?
if there 's any spying being done it 's being done on their side
all goes very well there
they 'r e very happy there
good to see you
can you move your toes ?
what are you doing ?
it 's broken
don 't move it !
i won 't
i just UNknown !
i 'm holding you responsible for this
we have a very fine doctor on staff from bulgaria
well uh dad unfortunately his highness had a little accident
no it was nothing terrible
he bro broke his leg
i i don 't know what to do
i ask her she just keeps UNknown the floors
mr UNknown is now in full charge
i want the UNknown out of the embassy
do you understand axel ?
o u t out !
yesterday i had to dodge embarrassing questions by dean UNknown
someone even used the word cover up
i will not have my life sabotaged by a UNknown
that is if the child is found to be defective the father has the right even the duty to kill his son
it 's her own life walter
she 's 21 !
he 's a harvard graduate !
because his father gives money
that 's how he graduated
but he 's a loser
walter don 't get involved
of all her prospects over the years this is the single worst
i prefer every one to him
even the draft dodger was better because he at least was a success
he beat the draft
away from the window
if you could please just go to your room
go to your room
maybe you should go outside and address them
you took a public speaking course
all wives this way
get away from walter
don 't touch that
don 't put it down
everybody just stay calm
everybody stay low
who 's walter ?
if you shake it could make it go off
are you sure you know what you 'r e doing ?
i 'm a highly trained professional
don 't shake him !
he 's shaking
okay shh !
get out of the room !
take her and go !
don 't worry about me
what about you ?
we 'r e not gonna leave you walter
i can 't cook with this going on
a rock just landed in my chocolate
here we go here we go
that 's how we met
uh no i think we 'r e okay
how 's everyone else ?
mr UNknown downstairs got hit in the head with a brick
he must have a concussion
he thinks he 's the wright brothers
the wright brothers
and you better call washington
no no !
well you 'r e crazy
yes but so are you
mr burns !
what if something goes wrong ?
you better get him twin beds
i 'm in complete control of everything
good now i feel safe because i heard him say he was in control
go better help the russians
that 's what this is about
mr UNknown ?
UNknown UNknown light as a feather make this tie all together
one moment please
the reason this did not work is because i 'm still learning
but god bless you
i 'm aware of that
no no no no
th that 's one thing i 'm not worried about because there are rules of diplomatic protocol that UNknown
please you 'r e dealing with the communists
they don 't believe in god they eat too much fat and they oh share bathrooms
we 'r e trying everything
everything means nothing if the communists don 't cooperate
no not nuts
no we UNknown l get more marines in here
we UNknown l pack the embassy
for how long ?
twelve years ?
uh UNknown escaped
listen to me i have information
i have connections
we can 't get UNknown m out of the embassy
give me one shoe
my shoe ?
give me one shoe !
i place the eggs inside the shoe
because i saw the egg went up your sleeve
that 's good luck !
i can 't believe how much i UNknown e screwed this up already
and it 's not just fathers
lots of mothers and brothers and sisters have said it
cousins uncles first of all you UNknown e got to stop being so hard on yourself
a lot of famous men had rough starts
hitler flunked out of art school
your father can 't do this !
we UNknown e got to tell my parents about this
that 's gonna be the hard part
is it your turn ?
no it 's your turn
it 's been ten minutes
mom dad do you have a minute ?
axel has something he needs to tell you
no more donald
what does the failure have to tell us ?
the UNknown guy was not good enough ?
it has to be
what would you do ?
i would deny it and claim to be a UNknown
okay happy ?
you UNknown e read the papers
what do families do when they 'r e caught behind the berlin wall and they desperately want freedom so desperately their lives depend on it ?
what do they do ?
they run through roadblocks
any other UNknown notions
i 'm afraid it 's the only answer
he 's insane !
dad would you please just hear him out ?
he 's come into possession of some very alarming information
did he get the results of his i q test back ?
we have reason to believe that the secret police are planning to have you eliminated
eliminated from what ?
walter just hear him out !
marion i 'm not an UNknown
it 's not my style
i show up at a place and i stay
you can 't stay
but the priest is safe right ?
six years he 's living upstairs you wanna stay here for six years ?
he 's a relic of an old regime
UNknown is different
you want her to stay here for the rest of her life ?
yes i 'd rather she grew up here than grow up an orphan
i can tolerate anybody 's orphans but my own okay ?
walter come here
i got a headache
do you want your daughter to see donald again ?
or at least meet some other eligible men ?
don 't you want that ?
tell me the plan just for fun
not that i 'm interested but i want to know what he 's thinking
the night after tomorrow we 'r e going to have a reception here
who 's catering ?
it 's a big party in honor of the emir
several hundred guests
now you two and susan get dressed
you wait in your room
just like that
i don 't like my dark blue UNknown
my UNknown UNknown
it 's a very soft fabric
sue me it UNknown
you 'r e gonna have to wear a dark suit because i 'm not gonna escape unless you dress
i 'm not dressing !
we 'r e not going anyplace
the moment you go outside the embassy limousine will be waiting
you get in and you 'r e off !
it 's simple
then where do we go ?
the rest is very simple
my contacts are ready to see to it that you UNknown l be on your way home within hours
mr UNknown i implore you for the safety of everyone involved
we cannot UNknown
i miss him so much !
by the way walter i didn 't mention this because i knew you 'd get upset
i got a letter from my brother
our apartment was robbed
oy i 'm a cursed UNknown
i i 'm running around here in europe and in new york there 's robbers with my initials on their shirt
that 's right
spring will be a little late this year
and that 's why the lady is a tramp
i and my wife have been invited
i thought you 'd be interested in knowing
this ambassador 's son the young UNknown
he 's either a genius or an idiot
look tonight 's the night
i 'd just feel better if we go over the whole thing again
it 's a rotten plan it won 't work
let 's call it off
we 'r e not calling anything off
hi mr UNknown
i 'm john randall
i 'm married i have four children
i was born in milwaukee wisconsin
i went to school in california
i first came to government under roosevelt
i UNknown in agriculture
who 's gonna ask me this ?
in the event that they stop you and ask you some questions your answers have to be consistent
what are you doing in europe ?
what am i doing in europe ?
i was also the former miss wisconsin of 1 941
if they believe that we win the whole cold war
one look at those UNknown veins they UNknown l think we 'r e smuggling road maps
where are you staying in town ?
the grand hotel for one week
then we 'r e flying to UNknown
okay now uh uh what happens when you leave the embassy ?
about midnight when some of the other guests are leaving we casually say excuse me and we leave with the largest group
our chauffeur then drives us directly to the lobby of the grand hotel
that 's if we 'r e not stopped arrested beaten tortured and thrown in jail
at the grand hotel we switch cars
a man will come up to me and say those are extremely lovely earrings
my wife has a pair just like them
he will be our driver
we go with him
what happens when he takes you to the train station ?
what happens ?
for my money marion he may as well have a neon sign that says i am a spy
okay and then what do you do ?
what do we do ?
we get on a train with him going to istanbul
another first in my life
i need istanbul like the plague
with my fear UNknown
halfway there we jump off the train
i 'm really looking forward to that
i haven 't jumped off a moving train in months
your contact is going to help you with these maneuvers
you see ?
after leaving the train we 'r e met by a man driving a wagon load of hay
we get onto the wagon and we go with him
i got the worst hay fever in america he gets us on a hay wagon
he takes us to the seashore where we 'r e picked up by a submarine
isn 't it thrilling ?
sub yesterday it was an airplane !
we had to change that
there were some security precautions
i 'm glad you told me
i 'd have spent the whole day looking for wings
you 'r e gonna need some local currency
oh forget it
we only have traveler 's checks
take the money
you 'r e gonna stop in a chase through an alley and start signing traveler 's checks ?
since when are there gonna be chases ?
you said this was gonna be simple
he said this would be simple
i can 't chase
mrs UNknown 's right
do you know how to fire one of these a pistol ?
a pistol ?
you load it here and then you just squeeze the trigger
boy it 's a beauty
i don 't think you should carry a gun
why not ?
they 'r e not dangerous
you don 't know how to use one !
who doesn 't know how to use one ?
since when ?
what are you talking about ?
i don 't know how to use a gun ?
when did you use a gun ?
i don 't know how to use a gun ?
plenty of times
i want to carry a gun
i 'm not gonna go if you carry a gun
all talking at once
she has to ruin everything
i want to carry scoffs
i 'm not going if i can 't
all right carry a gun
just make sure it 's not loaded
you can never tell when this little piece of tin comes in handy
and the sauce is his favorite UNknown
she 's crying already
you know that 's why i don 't like to go places with you
cause you always make everything into a
that 's why i was not keen on escaping
i knew you would turn it into a whole story
what 's the matter ?
what are you crying for ?
does something hurt you ?
no i 'm afraid
look at the very worst
the worst !
what 's the matter ?
hey take it easy
did i not always protect you ?
have i always taken care of you ?
with the white socks and the saddle shoes
i had to have the white socks
i had a foot infection
so you know it was doctor 's orders
have i not always from the very start when my mother despised you when she UNknown you i was on your side
remember that ?

the country was torn by civil war with many kingdoms struggling for land and power
but one king had a ruthless ambition to make himself emperor by the sword
the other rulers hired assassins to kill the king before he could conquered them all
kingdom by kingdom his army swept away everything in its path and anyone who resisted and anyone who resisted met terrible fate
the country was his
he UNknown his conquered enemies and forced them to build his great wall
when they were died or useless he had them buried beneath it
the emperor 's UNknown taught him mastery of the five elements
fire water earth wood and metal
his power seemed without limit
he was a master of millions
but like the UNknown peasant he could not stop growing old
he needed to defeat his last enemy
he ordered the general ming his oldest friend and trusted ally to find her
the witch was named UNknown yuan and she was nothing like the general expected
on the western border to the monastery of UNknown
there was house the greatest library in the ancient world and UNknown yuan was sure the secret to eternal life was here
it was the long lost UNknown bones
a collection of all the UNknown secrets of the ancient world
the emperor 's answer was here
along with other magic beyond imagining
she UNknown the spell in UNknown in ancient language that the emperor did not understand
the curse must never be lifted or the emperor will rise again to enslave all of mankind
on that dark day there will be nothing and no one to save us
you can run but you can 't hide
ten o UNknown lock
one o and this is won 't be for girl nothing to do

UNknown la is a crock
we heard that 's you used to say about mummies too UNknown

i can 't understand you

behind you !
or how i got here
and who are those guys who wanted to kill me
whatever you did back there was sick
no drunken fist
i am lu yang travelling scholar
what land do you come from monk ?
i 'm not a monk i am jason
jason UNknown from south boston
is this a dream ?
no where you came from is the dream
through the gate of 'n o gate
is that like a worm hole or something ?
no it means you 'r e either a zen master or you 'r e carrying something very special
to return the staff and end the reign of the jade warlord
return the staff to who ?
the monkey king
with his weapon in hand
his UNknown hi became like fire
his stick fighting like magic
he defied the order of the land
but the jade army could not defeat him
monkey king crushed every soldier sent to stop him
but with his magical staff he was UNknown
word of his disobedience travelled within the forbidden kingdom
to the five elements mountains land of the UNknown
once every 500 years the jade emperor hosts the peach banquet
it is here that the heavenly ministers gather to celebrate the UNknown and drink the elixir of immortality
into the banquet the monkey king crashed un invited
the jade emperor was enchanted by the monkey king
but the jade warlord was not amused
as master of the army the warlord demanded the monkey king bow down to him
he 's a bit UNknown that 's all
give the naughty monkey a title and let him go
satisfied all was well in heaven and earth
the supreme emperor left to begin his 500 years meditation
leaving the jade warlord in charge by UNknown of heaven
the warlord challenged the monkey king to a duel
high above five elements mountain
in the warlord 's palace the battle of UNknown was fought
to prove once and for all whose skill was supreme
most excellent stick fighting UNknown
but without your weapon you are nothing but a lonely hermit
no more weapons no more UNknown hi magic
fist against fist
laying down his magic weapon
realizing he was been tricked the monkey king UNknown the staff out into the middle kingdom
martial art is based on deception my friend
being immortal the monkey king could not be killed
only trapped in stone where he waits for the UNknown from the prophecy to return to him his great weapon and finally free him
that 's what i heard anyway a long time ago
how long has he been in prison ?
five hundred years give or take a few decades
they say when the monkey king is freed the jade emperor will return
how do i get home ?
you must return the staff to five elements mountain
you must free the monkey king
i can 't free the monkey king
i got to get home
innkeeper more wine
wine is my inspiration
what is this ?
how good is your kung fu ?
he who speaks does not know
he who knows does not speak
surely you are UNknown
it 's a fake
out of the way old fool
hand it over
she 's golden sparrow from the south
she does not think the drunkard immortal needed his life saved
you 'r e immortal ?
what did you run from child ?
bounty hunters trying to stop her from reaching the five elements mountain
i suggest you keep riding west
and only stop to water your horses
you are not coming ?
the journey to five elements mountain crosses UNknown and UNknown unspeakable dangers
worst of all no wine
you must understand this
do you understand ?
i must say goodbye
how good is your kung fu ?
he 's got no kung fu
he 's terrible
while you sit on the horse like the king of england
when are you going to teach me kung fu
you want to learn kung fu ?
that 's call strike
oh and the buddha palm technique
there 's a guy in UNknown fighter 2 who does the buddha palm technique
and he does the iron elbow
and he does the one finger death touch
the cup 's full
how can you learn kung fu if already know so much ?
know shadow kick buddha palm
empty your cup
it 's beautiful
the divine staff of legend
it was seen in the middle kingdom
mortals are always whispering of the prophecy
they 'r e entitled to it
what other offending news do you have for me ?
that is all my lord
summon the witch
where were we ?
we are doomed
that 's what i intend to find out
wait with the horses
UNknown province ?
you come here often
you have to give to me or somebody will get hurt
what kind of monk are you ?
stealing from travellers
praying UNknown very good
no fool !
you found him
we are all the same inside
aren 't we monk ?
heaven help us
as long as i can remember
an old man and a boy had tea here
a soldier monk rides with them
who else ?
men are such liars
jason go UNknown
horse stance grow roots
two masters cannot teach the same student
horse stance !
first you show respect to your teachers
so what about the two tigers and one mountain ?
we can kill each other when it is over
a painter can have kung fu
or the butcher who cuts meat every day with such skill
his knife never touches bone
learn the form but seek from this
hear the song list learn it all
and forget it all
a musician can have kung fu
or the poet who paints pictures with words
and mix UNknown with his tubes is kung fu
but do not name it my friend
for it is like water
nothing is softer than water
yet it can overcome rock
it does not fight
only you can free it
behold the tyranny of the warlord
he must be stopped
but we must not feel hatred towards him or he wins
if he speaks compassion for this devil he should go back to his temple and pray
our mission is not one of peace
go back to your mother and father
you are but a child
they are dead
to set an example the warlord dispatched his troop into night
legion upon legion poured out of the five elements mountain
into the low lands of the middle kingdom
screams of innocent people hung in the night air
when it was over UNknown roofs were all that remained
that and a lonely child hidden in a well by her mother
UNknown murdered by an arrow from the warlord 's bow
when she reaches the warlord 's palace she will not offer him forgiveness
monk she will offer him this
a jade dart that can kill any mortal
long has she practiced
master of sensitivity
they 'r e between us and the river of sand
isn 't it just like the monkey king to summon a boy to do a man 's job ?
this is not a dessert
that is the dessert
a monk of the mission
and where does he lead us
across the dessert to nowhere
we are not going to make it are we ?
and even if we do we UNknown l still have to face the jade army
what if i can 't handle it ?
what if i freeze ?
don 't forget to breath
if we don 't find water soon we will perish
perhaps a UNknown immortal can make rain
if he truly is a UNknown immortal
you are an insult to the name of buddha
over there !
in the clouds
looks like a green monster
green monster ?
they call the left field fence the green monster
it 's true
have you any family back in this land you come from ?
wonder who he was ?
maybe the only thing i UNknown e ever been good at is pretending that i don 't
she 's sorry
but in the end they will leave you with nothing
you survived the river of sand
i can ensure your safe return
just bring the weapon forward
i don 't think so
why do you want the staff ?
when i deliver the lost weapon the jade warlord shall grant me the elixir of immortality
an orphan girl a lost traveller an old drunkard and a monk who has failed at the same task for half his life
UNknown following a UNknown in hope of rescuing a UNknown
i mean he is right ?
what are you saying ?
we have to do something
i 'm afraid the wound is too deep
he will not survive it
he needs his wine
wine is his elixir
don 't have a running monk ?
when i was your age
i was a scholar warrior in training
my arrow was good so too my kung fu
so i was chosen to take the several examinations
to pass would place me in a very short line of scholar UNknown
if one does not attach himself to people and desire never shall his heart be broken
but then does he ever truly live ?
i would rather die a mortal who has a care for someone
than a man free from his own death
i don 't want to lose you
forget about me
it is the emperor 's UNknown of jade UNknown and salts of mercury
it is forever stored in the realm of the jade palace
high in the jade UNknown
rarely touched by mortals
only to face the jade army
i 'm sorry
yes there is
we can take the south side of the fortress
under cover of darkness
there is more at stake
an entire kingdom
we will advance in two nights
when the moon has ceased
so be it !
she was lost and frightened
not the kind she would stand and fight with
you have made the most excellent judgment
the UNknown from the prophecy not quite what i 'd expected
a man is dying back on song mountain
i need the elixir
because i brought you the staff
the life of your friend over the power to rule over the kingdom ?
a most reasonable offer
and a good teacher
however there is a little bit problem with your request
you see i promised the elixir to someone else
she didn 't bring you the staff
my leech you made a promised
there is but one way to resolve such matters
a martial challenge to the death
i find that quite amusing
do you really think even for a minute you stood a chance ?
i didn 't think so
she will kill you witch
not if i kill you first orphan bitch
the statue !
come drink with me
jade warlord ?
her destiny was written by her own hand
i am sorry
no gate to fulfill the prophecy of the mortals
what do you desire please ?
i just want to go home
i will never forget you
i suggest that is what immortal truly means
you have freed me traveller
now go free yourself
you 'r e going to shut up ?
listen piss end i 'm not going to ask you again
come on maggie get up come on
you want some more ?
you want some more ?
take it easy sir
missed his heart
i am immortal
yes i did
looks like it
you were very brave
while the traveller return to his world to walk the path of the warrior and find his own truth
as one tale ends so another begins
the UNknown of dr UNknown
a tale of the modern re appearance of an 11th century myth UNknown the strange and mysterious influence of a UNknown monk over a UNknown
spirits surround us on every side they have driven me from hearth and home from wife and child
i will tell you
a traveling fair had arrived
with it came a UNknown
my friend alan
the town clerk is in a bad mood today
what kind of a show is it ?
that night the first of a strange series of murders occurred
and the first victim was the town clerk

wake up cesare !
ladies and gentlemen !
how long shall i live ?
the time is short
the prophecy of the UNknown !
there is something frightful in our midst !
your suspicion of the UNknown seems justified
i shall ask the police for permission to examine him
when the shadows lay darkest
anxious about the long absence of her father
it 's true that i tried to kill the old woman
and i thought they would blame the mysterious murderer again but i swear i had nothing to do with the two other murders so help me god
i thought i might find my father dr olsen here
oh yes the doctor
after the funeral
i UNknown e been watching him for hours asleep in his box
is the prisoner safe in his cell ?
i hope so
have you a patient named UNknown ?
only the head of the institute can divulge the identity of our patients
would you care to see him ?
this has always been his special study
for months he caused in town after town great panic by repeated UNknown of murder committed always under the same circumstances
case UNknown and notes
at last !
the sleeper has been found dead in the ravine
the circle is closing in doctor UNknown !
today he is a raving madman chained to his cell
see there is cesare
jane i love you when will you marry me ?
we who are of royal blood may not follow the wishes of our hearts
you fools this man is plotting our doom !
we die at dawn !
he is UNknown !
he believes me to be the UNknown UNknown
since painting his last canvas percy had become irritable
his eyes are worn out
he seems to be going mad
if his UNknown is causing this shouldn 't he get rid of it ?

i would like to purchase it
i won 't sell that painting no matter what price might be offered

you should know if we are of the same mind
UNknown was witnessed UNknown UNknown UNknown say the origin is UNknown
it 's so beautiful
she 's a goddess with a first class license with no restrictions
so it 's no surprise
if only i could sing like that
first you 'd need to find a wonderful love
what are you saying you can sing like that ? !
this withered tree has UNknown coming out of it
your powers are amazing belldandy
no the tree spoke to me
it said it wanted to live here in the forest a little longer with the other living things
those feelings of the tree have given it a new life
i only lent a small helping hand that 's all
oh right !
really ? !
but the thing that counts is taking the listeners feelings into consideration and showing that you care through your song
if you have those feelings then everything will turn out fine
thank you sister !
i 'd like to do as much for her if i can
guess it 's natural to be nervous
attention UNknown and returning students
i 'd like to thank you for coming today to the motor club 's welcoming ceremony
through motor sports we the motor club members try to learn about UNknown effort and will power in order to make our campus life more meaningful
now if everyone would please step back behind the pylons
we would like to demonstrate a few of our activities
let 's begin !
all these vehicles have run in many races and have set some very impressive records
with these machines we hope to UNknown our UNknown with many other teams and have a really good time ; that 's our motto !
UNknown at the event next week in UNknown the motor club will participate with the help of world wind
and this is the bike that will run the race !
what do you say ?
will you join our club and help us expand the activities of
thank you very much !
and our first new member is a girl !
we 'r e like totally blown away that you came here for us today !
UNknown and i UNknown are studying at the graduate school of this university
any time and anywhere we can help you out with our fiery spirits !!
no UNknown !
so come with us !
together we UNknown l light the fires inside you and build up the hard bodies that house them !
become a star of motor sports !
and get a big bang out of life !
so you blew the chance to get more club members ?
what 's with you two ? !
why do you always do this ? !
but i suppose that means these people here are the true hard core motor sports fans
that 's right !
we share the same happiness and pain and will carry on together !
we welcome you with open arms !
you don 't like this kind of party ?
don 't worry ; they look pretty weird but they 'r e basically good guys
you must be interested in motor sports seeing as you joined the club
do you have a motorbike or a car ?
the new members seem pretty nervous
it reminds me of when i first joined
i didn 't have a clue what to do
i was very nervous too but had all kinds of dumb UNknown
they UNknown l be fine
they UNknown l experience lots of things here and think of them as great memories
every one of them has a good heart that UNknown them to do that
maybe in the future i UNknown l
you 'r e up next
sure i 'm fine
she 's pretty and nice and smart
not to mention her great cooking and knock out figure !
you 'd better look after her real good !
come off it you UNknown e gotta drive home !
give that to me !
nobody goes that far
look my UNknown are this big !
okay i UNknown l show them to ya !
hey i never asked to see them !
well what do ya think ?
snap out of it UNknown !
uh i 'm
next year and the year after and ten years from now
i 'd like to spend all my springs with you UNknown
i 'm coming !
hello UNknown residence
oh my to what do i owe UNknown ?
ifit 's UNknown wish then i don 't need one UNknown
i wouldn 't get hold of you for something like that
someone UNknown a man who was UNknown in the luna dungeon
word is that he might be headed that way
i don 't even know what 's going on
get me a UNknown while you 'r e out !
you UNknown e grown even more beautiful though
much more beautiful than before
UNknown i UNknown l introduce you
this is my UNknown UNknown
he 's taught and guided me for many years since i was a child so i could become a goddess first class
so what brings you here ?
or did you just come here to see me ?
last time you just disappeared so suddenly
where UNknown e you been all this time ? !
i came to get you
you haven 't changed either
get away from belldandy !
but UNknown he 's
but i want to give it one more try
i want to give belldandy one more chance to choose her path
reaching the gate !
what is it ?
level four auto UNknown sequence !
what about the emergency protector ?
no good it 's not working
this is no good !
judging by the route it 's taking i 'd say the virus is headed for the main system
the output of satellite 6 dropped by 20 !
ex you run a UNknown test on that virus route and block the line
UNknown you eliminate the virus trapped behind the wall
yes ma 'a m
what the heck happened ? !
that 's what i 'd like to know !
it seems like a spell 's been cast on her
what on earth ?
we UNknown e gotta do something
i UNknown l try
i can UNknown UNknown
what happened down there ?
the man in question came into contact and that 's when UNknown
right now we 'r e shutting down the network and trying to stop further invasion
so we can 't bring belldandy there UNknown ?
so no backup ?
we 'i l finish as soon as we can and then we 'i l UNknown
until then i wantyou to follow the man who did this
you make it sound so simple
i 'm asking because i believe in you
i 'm praying forthe best
this is really starting to get ugly
i 'm going back into the heavens to ask someone for help !
isn 't belldandy well ?
it seems like this is out of our control
it 's cold !
the gate 's locked right now
we won 't know what kind of effect his spell has on her until she UNknown consciousness
don 't look !
i 'm here to make your wishes come true
but you can wish only once
uh i 'd like to ask you something
why is UNknown here at your house mr UNknown ?
and UNknown too
i UNknown e been here ? !
but this is the first time i UNknown e met mr UNknown
our purpose is to assist troubled people such as yourself
please tell me your wish
u UNknown do you think
yeah it looks like she has amnesia
what ? !
UNknown memory loss ; he deliberately erased only her memories of UNknown
who has amnesia ?
come on UNknown !
how about i make my wish that belldandy 's memory will be returned ?
i don 't really understand but i UNknown l give it a try
huh ? !
i 'm just going to get in touch with someone
wait a second !
UNknown just told me that we can 't contact them or go there right now
so she said to stay here and wait it out
oh i see
but let me know if there 's anything else i can do for you
man you 'r e giving me such a hard time !
well i UNknown l do it this time !
think it UNknown l work this time ?
no problems !
we 'r e up to trial number 26
here you are
i think i should cancel the race next week
could i go with you ?
i 'd like to see what the college you attend is like
it must be beautiful
meeting wonderful professors and trying to better yourself
my teacher was a wonderful person too
but right now he 's gone to a place far far away
i wish i could see him again
the virus which entered through her has been spreading through the network attacking and destroying it
its UNknown dropped by 8
currently we UNknown e set up a barrier around the dummy system and we UNknown e stopped further invasion
while the barrier is holding up we will UNknown the virus in UNknown and recover the entire system
when finished we will link belldandy with the dummy system and UNknown the main system
although i hope it won 't
you mean you UNknown e made your wish ? !
no it 's your outfit ; it stands out too much
i was wondering if you could wear something a little more normal looking
are you sure you want to make that your one wish ?
all right then
just a minute !
is that your wish ?
no i 'm just saying
if people in this world find out you 'r e a goddess it UNknown l be a big mess !
oh really ?
it 's not my wish it 's a rule you have to follow
okay i understand
i UNknown e changed !
is this better ?
then this ?
then how about this ?
i 'm sure her memory will come back soon
then who 's going in the race next week ?
what a drag
and it 's a mixed race so it 's not like anyone can replace her
UNknown do you wanna try ?
i can 't !
shall i go in the race ?
do you know how to ride ?
more or less since i watched the other day
it 's just like that
you can go faster or slower depending on the passenger
that 's what makes the UNknown so much fun
in other words the driver trusts the passenger and opens up the throttle
you 'r e saying you 'r e going to trust me too ?
i have to
here mr UNknown
i 'm sure you UNknown l be great !
don 't forget to check the fuel level
changing the chamber was right thing to do
it sounded great
like belldandy and UNknown
oh we 'r e not !
what 's the connection between getting close to those two and our goal ?
UNknown to stick close to them
the time UNknown when you UNknown UNknown
then what UNknown l happen ?
this is all to realize your wish UNknown UNknown
i can turn
yeah i UNknown l fix it for sure
it 's already gotten in pretty deep and there are many parts that i can 't UNknown with
and take a look at this
the rhythm of the virus movement pattern is linked to belldandy 's UNknown
you 'r e right
to think he stole belldandy 's pass code so easily and used such a high level virus
do you know anything about the person who did this ?
i was told on the condition of absolute secrecy
it 's a person of high class whose name shouldn 't be leaked right ?
does the person have anything to do with belldandy ?
i said it 's highly confidential
at any rate even though we don 't know the person 's UNknown we mustn 't let him invade UNknown
but rushing things won 't help
i 'm not proud of what i did
why don 't you just let her see the real you ?
don 't forget how long you UNknown e been living together
trusting each other at a time like this is what being lovers is all about right ?
s sister ? !
that 's not the point
hey what 's going on ?
are we celebrating something ?
are you mad ?
if you don 't eat every last bite she might never get her memories back of you
um if you 'r e not hungry
no this is perfect timing !
i was starving !
thanks don 't mind if i do !
how is it ?
perhaps i UNknown l ask UNknown about it
i saw the photos of you and i smiling happily
it made me think your smile these days seems a little empty and sad
that makes me sad too seeing as it 's my job to make people happy
so i 'm going to try hard and do what i can to make you smile again
if those photos of you and i are real then i want to know more about you
what ? !
i was careless
wanna cancel the UNknown race ?
i think that 's a good idea
i UNknown l even practice
UNknown we 'r e gonna enter the race after all
i want to try the best we can right now so
i still believe you UNknown l win
that 's why i 'm leaving the race to you two
who 's he ?
how about a coffee together
i 'm done with you
the formula for the flow of fluid is
ich war UNknown und UNknown ich war UNknown
you look kind of excited
ich war UNknown und UNknown ich war UNknown
this rule is called UNknown
the prof 's gonna be furious bursting in like that !
i UNknown e been looking for you
we need to talk
what ? !
we 'r e gonna practice so she can go in it
practicing will be a waste of time
we won 't know until we try !
even if she has amnesia she 's still belldandy !
then time us both and see which is faster
i 'm in the UNknown club ; what do you want me for ?
you 'r e the queen of drag racing right ?
just stick with me here
belldandy 's still not better is she ?
which is it ?
there were lots of people and i was so happy
and with me was was you wasn 't it ?
we almost had it huh
when they 'r e in sync no one stands a chance against them
i don 't want to get close to those two anymore
UNknown UNknown ?
then UNknown it ?
is this really going to create a new world ?
UNknown UNknown will open a UNknown a new world
she 's UNknown to UNknown way
in the same way UNknown are starting to UNknown
today just a little i could sense the time that i had spent with mr UNknown
but still most of my memories seem locked in a cloud
so then what is this feeling that has been awakened ?
i want to know more about this feeling
and about the other me that 's sleeping inside myself
so it seems like her memories are slowly starting to come back
what did he do to belldandy ?
i don 't know exactly
but one thing 's for sure ; her memories weren 't erased
it 's not like anyone can erase one 's memories even in heaven
and even UNknown doesn 't have those powers
so if you can act as her UNknown the window to her heart should open
i 'm sure
why would he do that ? !
i 'm glad you came
why did you hide my memories ? !
you weren 't the kind of person who 'd do something like that
my soul was chained in the silent frozen dungeon
in its solitude i almost lost myself
but then on the beautiful blue planet that i could see from there
i began to sense your presence
my heart had almost been sealed shut but your existence made me remember something i had to do
the gods in heaven locked away things that happened between you and me
now i UNknown l show you everything
and i UNknown l make you remember the truth behind what i was trying to do
it 's no model
when someone from a world falls in love with one living in another world they come here to test that love
the two must both pass through the gate
if there are any doubts or deception in their hearts the two will be torn apart
and they never meet again
if there is no disloyalty they receive the blessings of the gods
but no one has ever made it safely through this gate
the system created by the gods UNknown every single person into his living assignment in the world and UNknown his role and controls it
the gods in heaven pretend not to see the suffering of those people
and test them
the sad voices of people born into this world have pierced the depths of my heart
i want to do something to save them without UNknown against anyone !
but the only way to do that is to create a new system
look this was created by the gods !
i cannot allow a system that gives rise to such things !
this is an expression of my will against the present establishment in heaven
i want you to come with me
with your help the wishes of the weak will definitely come true
all people will be treated equally
i want to offer help to many people who are suffering
val UNknown !
and you even made the divine protector of time destroy herself
the sin you committed is not to be taken lightly
UNknown we will freeze your ability to UNknown your UNknown form and your soul will be sealed in the level 1 7 non life form
you will be imprisoned for all eternity on the face of the moon
we cannot afford to lose belldandy one of our best goddesses
the things that happened will be sealed as top secret
the incident will never be revealed
it 's been a long time belldandy
i was told to give this to you
if you drink this all your unhappy thoughts will be forgotten
belldandy there 's something i must tell you
an urgent matter came up and UNknown had to suddenly depart for far away
are you trying to make the same mistake ?
you more than anyone should understand my ideas and wish for their realization
i wish for no such thing !
don 't harm UNknown
over there !
hey wait !
do you think you can help ? !
even if i am just a human there must be something i can do !
snap out of it !
he UNknown l only hurt you !
you should be able to understand that now !
she can 't control her power !
if she lashes out all hell will break loose !
mr UNknown !
give your sadness to me
and i UNknown l give everything i have to you
let 's walk the future together
and then it UNknown l all be over
no it UNknown UNknown the beginning
well that 's a relief
UNknown 's lucky having three goddesses to look after him
just get some rest
UNknown let 's return to heaven when all this is over shall we ?
i do nothing but make mr UNknown suffer !
i can 't even
and i think you were too even before you lost your memories of him
so many things happened since you came to earth
you met so many people
and UNknown was always there by your side
the two of you used to smile happily together
don 't give up sister
once you get your memories back things will return to the way they used to be !
for sure !
i UNknown l try hard and become myself again
here this is for you
the real me
UNknown made me remember that
but the person i am now
take care of the rest okay ?
um even if she loses her memories nothing will change between you two right ?
what happened ? !
forget me ; you UNknown e got to worry about yourself
that 's okay
are you worried about me ?
that 's not the important thing here !
that 's serious !
but we were forced to stay apart
i feel funny seeing the two of you together
maybe you two can overcome the obstacles that i couldn 't
i can 't stand the thought of that
because that UNknown l make my relationship seem insignificant
but what i 'm trying to do seems to result in quite the opposite
it 's like i 'm helping you and belldandy
why what for ?
would you make my dream come true ?
i 'm not really following you but i can tell you UNknown e been hurt
still it 's not something material that you want right ?
belldandy will become UNknown 's girl no matter what you do
and you UNknown l be left alone
what are you talking about ?
the world is about to change
that 's why i UNknown e come here
and this is my new start
are you the one who erased belldandy 's memories ? !
it 's invaded areas e and g !
we can 't build the barrier in time !
switching to emergency system !
the virus made it through !
UNknown at this rate 20 of the heavenly system will be shut down !
this might affect earth as well !
as long as the system has a direct connection with belldandy we won 't be able to stop it from spreading unless we UNknown the virus main body !
prepare for injection
we UNknown l give belldandy a vaccination before this problem affects the earth
you know that !
of course it 's too hard seeing UNknown and belldandy like this !
but if this doesn 't work not only her memories of UNknown but her memories of us and those in heaven will completely vanish too !
i don 't want that to happen !
if that 's the only solution then let us be the way things are !
the vaccination is what i think right ?
but there 's a high possibility that it will leave side effects
so in other words
the risk is so great that this treatment hasn 't been used for hundreds of years
morgan 's on UNknown 's side it turns out
maybe she has what it takes to give you back your memories
so maybe you don 't need that dangerous vaccination
i 'm going to take the vaccination
it 's just that i couldn 't hold my feelings in
i felt insecure and i thought my heart was going to be torn apart
so i ran away
but there 's also an ugly part of me that wants you to love no one but myself
could you love me despite that ?
i love you because of that
thank you mr UNknown
even if my chances are only 1 6
if it can make me be like i used to
i 'd find you and we 'd start all over again
again and again
break the veil of the darkness and cast off the evil future
oh great one that brings wind back to the earth
contact established with belldandy !
hold on to the light of hope
send them who nest in the large tree and cast shadows between the past present and future back to the world without light
virus substance located !
the virus has consumed the vaccination and it has been converted to another program !
oh no !
what is it ?
someone 's hacked into the main system !
the altered program has started UNknown the UNknown !
it 's getting through all the UNknown !
where 's it headed ? !
to the top secret program !
you just used their feelings
you created a program that would get past UNknown 's system UNknown using belldandy 's emotional waves and the vaccination that added to it
you even went that far
i did it all to destroy the world that is shut tight !
a large energy field is building around the residence !
it 's very powerful !
i can 't stop it !
more importantly what about belldandy ? !
what 's happening to belldandy ? !
the system 's in such a mess i can 't tell !
it 's UNknown !
it 's very exciting that you UNknown e become her instructor UNknown
she 's very important in heaven
i truly want her to become a lady with a beautiful heart
oh my there 's belldandy
it 's nice to meet you belldandy
i 'm UNknown
why are you crying ?
this little bird
just call me UNknown
i UNknown hereby promise to stay with you until the day you leave the nest
i found you belldandy
how come ?
i know everything you think you know
so no matter where you hide i UNknown l always find you right away
know what ?
make it better okay ?
i 'd rather hear you sing a song for it
a song ?
hurry and grow up belldandy
you UNknown e worked at this for many years
she will be placed in the goddess relief office and will study other worlds
the world is full of suffering and sadness
much of what you see will hurt you deeply
you won 't be able to retain your innocence
the world must be reborn
belldandy it 's me
i found it with your help
the energy in the tree gives me the power to go through the barrier in heaven that i could not overcome
now no one else will have to suffer not even morgan
you either belldandy
they 'r e filled with happiness because they make an effort to live and to mature !
and even though they age they learn to have joy be sad and love in the process !
i UNknown e seen many cases of such happiness here on earth !
all you want is the kind of maturity where you turn the hands of time forward
i understand why the gods sent you here to earth
but can you also love the sickness and death that run UNknown in this world ?
for earth 's life forms to advance that far they need over tens of thousands of years !
during that time more and more suffering ones will appear
i can 't stand by and watch that !
i can 't wait for that long !
one day you UNknown l have to face the judgement gate yourself
you think you can make it through ? !
do you have confidence that you won 't lose your lover ? !
if we believe in each other
what is this thing ? !
the final program is UNknown up
can 't you stop it ? !
the system isn 't UNknown with all the damage from the virus
we have to do something about that monster
let 's go UNknown !
huh ? !
we UNknown l let her take care of UNknown
let 's just do what we 'r e able to !
hey wait !
they 'r e getting all they can out of life and they UNknown e found their dreams
the future isn 't something handed to you on a platter
mr UNknown and i want to live on our own UNknown too
even though there are different worlds i 'm sure we 'd all still feel the same way
i 'm belldandy the goddess first class with no restrictions
i must work for the pride and dignity of the life forms here on earth !
i said we 'd stop it but
in that case
with your great power
become UNknown in my hand you the power that UNknown everything !
destructive booming thunder !
why are you helping him morgan the fairy princess ? !
the gods think only of themselves
i won 't have my hopes stolen from me any longer !
what you 'r e about to open up is a pandora 's box
a place devoid of the light of hopes !
stop thinking you 'r e the only one who 's suffering !
i want all this to happen !
do you actually believe that ? !
at this rate earth 's life forms will receive a high UNknown energy UNknown at once from thousands of years in the future !
and they won 't be able to maintain their current UNknown system !
is it not our mission to guide them ?
stop this program !
your method is mistaken !
do you have any idea what effect all this energy will have on earth 's life forms ? !
there are no other means !
the gods have created the world this way
the only way i can change it is with my power !
people will all become equally happy
you must hope for the same thing !
i 'm simply trying to correct the mistake of the gods !
you 'r e wrong !
why why did you start to think that way ? !
you 'r e the one who taught me that life was precious !
i want to grow old with the lives here on earth !
that 's why
even if the judgement gate appears before us ?
the values are rapidly increasing !
reaching critical state !
it 's going to be a while yet
this isn 't working at all !
in that case
i don 't want to see you unhappy
but in the new world that won 't be an issue any longer
you will be needed there
as a symbol to guide the new start to life
i want you to be by my side
stop it !
i 'm trying to prove that i 'm not !
the current system can 't stop the huge flow of energy !
UNknown 's is 4 78 restored !
the energy UNknown is over 30 !
5 02 restored 5 06 5 08 5 1 2
ere shut down all the lines
and terminate all the running programs
UNknown authorize goddess first class UNknown
the gate ?
this is all that is left for us
just when i 'm trying to show you the world that the gods wished for why do you stop me ? !
why waste time and make people suffer ?
belldandy will suffer as well
you people are using your powers to protect this era as well
heaven and UNknown why are you both
our powers exist to protect those we love !
even if my body is torn apart
even if it costs my life !
belldandy i don 't know what 's right
but no matter what world we 'r e talking about that world has no meaning for me without you in it
i know you feel the same UNknown
remember the light of the hopes you UNknown e seen inside belldandy
remember the world you UNknown e spent time in !
the hopes you UNknown e UNknown !
even if the gods are turned to enemies
i UNknown l keep on protecting you
my beloved UNknown
we UNknown e come this far
there 's no one here that i love
it 's not like you don 't know what this gate is
then we UNknown l be separated forever right ?
of course belldandy and i are afraid of the consequences
still i don 't want to let go of her hand
i want to live together with her
that 's why i
people have the strength to overcome their obstacles
i was afraid that even if there were no gate some day we would go our separate ways
but what really matters is living in the present
believing in the future
i will stay here
i UNknown l tell them that people like you were once here
the last branch !
can 't you do anything ?
UNknown you told me to never give up
i UNknown l be back
i 'm glad you UNknown e returned
it has the power to live life to its UNknown and the power to carry on into the future
all we need to do is support it the best we can
the feeling of loving someone brings powers to us goddesses
your joy is proof that you UNknown e shared your happiness with someone
your sadness is proof that you UNknown e shared your suffering with someone
even if the road is rough you UNknown l have a better life than with no one around
proof of life is something everyone holds in his heart
an unknown program is running now
now we can have ourselves a rest !
to the hot springs !
i 'm going shopping at the goddess mall !
h hey everybody !
yes we know !
but we 'r e no different
but loving people and learning from the past and living life UNknown is the key to a wonderful future i believe
heaven has granted my selfish wish to stay here by UNknown 's side
i believe that we 'r e close to the entrance to the world that you dream of
i love this world where UNknown was born
UNknown two have taken the UNknown down the road UNknown pointed to
i wasn 't a UNknown
UNknown has UNknown into a UNknown
if you truly think so then it 's all due to you and UNknown and many other people
you haven 't changed quick to cry
i UNknown UNknown be praying UNknown
UNknown really was a wonderful instructor to me
yes and now it 's all over
yes but there 's still one side effect from the virus
that 's easy to decide
you 'r e about 1 00 years too early
what ? !
why 'd you bump it up ? !
then tomorrow ?
by UNknown UNknown UNknown UNknown UNknown net
blood is never UNknown art
91 7 of the UNknown
didn 't your friend turn up ?
think before you do this !
think very carefully
of course you are
any witnesses ?
i UNknown e asked for the footage from the approach roads
forensics have finished ?
we UNknown e checked his passport his driver 's licence
he 's ltalian
UNknown del piero
have i missed something ?
put it this way lf that 's del piero they 'r e gonna be a player short at UNknown on sunday
they UNknown e turned him onto his stomach
give me a hand freddy
gently does it
he was waiting for someone before ordering
then he suddenly jumped up and left without paying
and the waiter didn 't go after him ?
he thought he 'd gone to the toilet
after a whole bottle of water
have you got a minute commissioner ?
yes of course
so can you get some more peanuts ?
a customer booked a table for half past twelve but didn 't turn up
UNknown a table for one ?
it may be nothing but i thought you should see it
yes of course
take it away as evidence
they UNknown e killed dad
UNknown UNknown UNknown
those guys came straight from a war and imported it into this country
why don 't we dump the body on organised crime ?
you know who 's in charge ?
it lives in the sea and is eaten with french fries
preferably in months with an r in them
this time de UNknown is welcome to it
right what shall we do ?
what 's the plan ?
what does anyone do if they want to get somewhere in this world ?
fill up with petrol
with a smart car like that they usually pay with plastic
or d UNknown ou know someone who might ?
listen UNknown UNknown
maybe i should ask her if she 's got time to check the colour of your UNknown ?
or the UNknown date on your chocolate
bought in your shop this morning
it 's still edible
but there 's a margin
i haven 't got time for your crap
try UNknown UNknown
you know that
but you say it 's a revenge killing ?
are you sure he 's UNknown ?
he had a ring with a two headed eagle
everyone wears our eagle these days
it 's become fashionable
he died on his stomach
ls he from another clan maybe ?
the UNknown ?
and i don 't get out much
his killers turned him over onto his stomach
on his stomach or his back so what ?
dead is dead
a dead person has to be on their back so their soul can go up to heaven
with a UNknown twig next to them
a UNknown twig ?
it 's a mark of respect
a mark of respect ?
not shooting someone that 's a mark of respect !
come back safely UNknown
i 'm a man of honour
more important than why is who
mark UNknown ?
what happened between our UNknown ?
do you question people with bad blood ?
you 'r e right captain
from now on their shadow is UNknown in
until blood has been washed away with blood
carry it with honour
i doubt it
your father was to be martin 's godfather
it will be an honour to cut his first hair
haven 't seen anything yet
but i 'm not even halfway through
ls me having to check all the UNknown on my own normal ?
of course it is you 'r e the youngest
it 's cos you UNknown e got the UNknown eyes
and that 's because you 'r e the youngest
how 's identification of the body going ?
his photo 's not on file
not locally or UNknown
linda are the UNknown still in UNknown ?
yes above the UNknown nightclub their cover
got your dancing shoes with you freddy ?
to be honest i don 't much fancy waltzing into a clan war
oh dear freddy
lf it 's to pick up UNknown who are back on the street the next day no thanks
we mustn 't screw this up
lf our body does belong to a clan the UNknown demands vengeance
so we may well be scraping his killers off the pavement tomorrow
ls that such a bad thing ?
get out of here naomi
it 's not safe
now get out of here
just a minute
you don 't think it 's a coincidence eh ?
commissioner UNknown homicide
are you UNknown ?
you dare look my father in the eye ?
who 's the man in the photo ?
piss off !
ln our own place dammit !
phone round send UNknown 's photo to people
i want to know where the rat is
did you crash into his car or something ?
i UNknown e never even pissed on his handle
good evening public prosecutor
that 's quick
UNknown is going to get under our feet and he won 't let up
so get him taken off the case before it 's too late
and the reason ?
what has that got to do with our operation ?
he 's going to mess up all our work
he won 't get that far
by then everything will be over
just keep an eye on things
that 's all we can do at the moment
they 'r e looking for me
i UNknown l call you
yeah right !
take a seat
made in the name of UNknown yes
your name 's in here three more times
i have eaten there
my name was on a list at UNknown 's too
d UNknown ou think the lunch UNknown or UNknown 's threats are related to the murder ?
i don 't know how
maybe there are two UNknown
then i UNknown l definitely go crazy
lf the public prosecutor gets hold of that book he UNknown l take us off the case
yes i thought that too so i UNknown l put it in the bottom of my drawer
who knows maybe i UNknown l forget about it
no you mustn 't do that
i can 't ask a colleague to do that
i wouldn 't do it for a colleague
the fact you UNknown e already kept quiet about it could cost you your career
there are more things to life than a career
really i 'm not
um a coffee ?
or is someone joining you ?
lf sir is looking for some hot company just say the word
don 't then
which room ?
start the bloody car !
start the car !
don 't know
does it ?
unless i want to be found here of course
one thing is certain your UNknown works quickly
faster than our courts anyway
now it 's a question of who is going to take revenge on who
maybe it 's not necessary
maybe the UNknown 's among them
bring him in tomorrow for a UNknown
are forensics on their way ?
it seems like it yes sir
you know you can always call on our organised crime cell
lf we need commissioner de UNknown we UNknown l certainly contact him
i get the impression you need him already
you will already have realised that the UNknown are difficult territory
UNknown customary common law
i 'm familiar with the UNknown and UNknown UNknown in UNknown
and the language ?
right well we won 't discuss it on the street
tomorrow at 9 ok ?
we UNknown e still got a lot to do here
ln my office at 9
de UNknown is currently the expert on the UNknown mafia
statistics don 't lie
d UNknown ou know why ?
because he 's open to teamwork
i know you UNknown e had your differences but i also know you 'r e not a man who holds grudges
believe me you can do with his UNknown UNknown
no no no
working as a team is the only way to work
we UNknown e identified all the victims of last night 's shooting
all three men are from the UNknown clan
you paid UNknown a visit last night UNknown
we 'r e about to bust the UNknown clan
we UNknown e been watching them for some time
an isolated operation now could seriously endanger our plans
which is why teamwork 's required
what was the reason for your visit ?
we think the shooting at the hotel is linked to the murder on the UNknown
this is the victim
we UNknown e been watching the UNknown for some time and
i don 't know this man
i 'm sure you don 't
lf he 'd just sneezed on a clan member 's second cousin 's cleaner we 'd know him
and if he 'd said more than two words to her his picture 'd be on this wall
anyway UNknown del piero
yes that 's something new
it 's called a false passport
can i count on you ?
have i got a team UNknown ?
it 's too tough in the mountains for you
i can be tough
how do you know ?
this belongs to my parents
i 'm not like that
linda about last night at my place
it was stupid
i shouldn 't have come to your place
when i said i bring bad luck
i didn 't want to scare you off
bad luck was meant as something positive then ?
well maybe i did want to scare you off but
i hope i didn 't succeed
look what they found on the hotel 's roof yesterday !
a UNknown twig
to de UNknown ?
public prosecutor 's orders
officially we are now one team
officially one team ?
you know what UNknown l happen
we UNknown l do all the work hand it over and then they UNknown l elbow us aside
i thought you didn 't want the case
i do if they want to take it away
i think i UNknown e got something
i UNknown e thought that for ages
lf the itching won 't stop see a doctor
i UNknown e looked at the UNknown again with the photos from the hotel as a reference
this is the camera on the UNknown theatre
take a good look at those two
UNknown for identification purposes unfortunately
this looks much better
and that 's not all
that 's UNknown 's bad tempered little boy
well done UNknown
come on teach me to shoot
don 't be silly !
bloody hell naomi
i 'm an adult now
and i love him
shall i show you where his name is tattooed ?
the victim may not have sneezed on anyone on your wall but he got his blood on their bullets
we UNknown e identified two killers
this one 's now in the UNknown
and we saw this one at UNknown 's
yeah yeah yeah that 's the guy with the scar
that 's UNknown UNknown
i told you they were all on my wall
they should be in prison not on a wall !
well done gentlemen
right i UNknown e got an arrest warrant
i need back up
it 's time to put all your cards on the table de UNknown
wow very smart !
we UNknown e hacked into their internal security system
so we see what they see
and more besides
UNknown to his friends
UNknown has got a large cargo and he 's desperate to get rid of it
a large cargo of drugs ?
that won 't get your photo in the paper eh mr de UNknown ?
we UNknown e been working on the deal for months
tomorrow morning at 9
UNknown and all the UNknown scum are going to jail for years
as for UNknown you needn 't worry we UNknown l wrap him up nicely for you and you can question him until you retire
we 'r e coming with you
it 's our case too
we UNknown l arrest UNknown UNknown
we UNknown l arrest him now then we won 't get in your way tomorrow
lf you do that
i tend to agree with UNknown
and you your nappy !
you 'r e a real artist
how 's the sausage business UNknown ?
UNknown UNknown is a UNknown coward
he doesn 't dare set foot outside
help me get in
that 's my problem
and if you don 't help me i UNknown l kill you
you UNknown e got a choice
not everyone can say that
we 'r e on the avenue
UNknown 20 minutes
UNknown in position
everything 's blocked within the perimeter
everyone stand by
and tell UNknown and his clown to keep quiet
clown to UNknown
the autopsy report on the UNknown murder has arrived
can you call me back there 's something strange about it ?
i UNknown l call you back
cargo is entering the perimeter
ok close the perimeter
he crossed the road with a sports bag
when did you lose him ?
almost right away
there are only UNknown here eh ?
we have visual
UNknown is coming down the steps together with two others
ln total six targets
what d UNknown ou mean ?
my son in UNknown ?
where is he ?
so he 's out there walking around like a target on legs
haven 't you lost enough people ?
lf UNknown escaped because of your UNknown you UNknown l wish we 'd never met !
that UNknown as you describe it was a perfectly executed operation
it led to a historic victory over the UNknown mafia in this city
your killer no longer has an organisation to fall back on so it 's only a matter of time before we catch him too
and you know UNknown you can always rely on the active support of the organised crime cell
only the cleaner and meat UNknown went in and out
he arrived alone and left alone
what about in the back of the van ?
the UNknown camera would UNknown e seen him
bloody hell !
how did they get there so quickly ?
watch the place and wait for back up they said
block their way !
throw your gun out !
hands on your head !
stupid bitch !
beg his forgiveness and die with honour
i 'm not begging a rat for forgiveness
beg his forgiveness !
d UNknown ou want to die with a lie on your lips ?
i did what i had to do
i UNknown the vermin
come on freddy
yes but there 's a problem
he called my father a rat
the UNknown clan spreads lies about me too
they UNknown e now been paid for with blood
you should ieave the country
after i UNknown e kept my promise
the police UNknown l look for you
after i UNknown e kept my promise !
after you UNknown e kept your promise
take whatever time you need to write your report
ln these painful circumstances we cannot decently ask anything more of you and your team
someone has to tell her parents
right we UNknown l
can you caii me back there 's something strange about it ?
if what i feel is bad iuck
i want bad luck for the rest of my iife
thanks to our UNknown operation our cell has UNknown the UNknown clan
the UNknown and the brains behind it have all been arrested bar one
however to our great regret one of our most promising inspectors
lost her life during an act of great courage
we 'r e almost certain the UNknown 's a foreign member of the UNknown clan
details of this will be issued later
now i 'd like to ask for a minute 's silence in memory of lnspector linda de UNknown
the autopsy report ?
they only do that to traitors
so our man was a police informer
that 's why he wasn 't in the files
de UNknown and the public prosecutor must UNknown e known him !
so they must know who avenged him
we 'r e investigating this ourselves !
teamwork stops here
you 'r e not being fair
it 's a UNknown
my inspector is dead you bastard !
let me see it again
i don 't know him
honestly i don 't
that one 's been bothering me
that 's UNknown UNknown
a businessman UNknown 's partner
he came here from germany to set up some businesses
UNknown 's business partner ?
i told you that last time
good health and a long life
good health and a long iife
congratulations and a long life
the police !
everyone is welcome here
commissioner this is my son 's christening
i UNknown e got guests from all over europe
who 's this in the photo ?
i don 't know
you don 't know him but you do business with him
maybe one of your guests from all over europe knows him
you 'r e making a big mistake
no i 'm not
do you know him ?
who 's this ?
bloody hell UNknown he 's here !
the guy from the UNknown
he 's here !
he 's a hairdresser
he 's an ltalian
bullshit man !
where is he ?
go and get UNknown
bloody hell !
and what 's that hole in your cellar ?
don 't forget to give me a receipt eh ?
this is doing my head in !
i want the place under 24 hour surveillance
everyone who comes anywhere near the place is to be checked
zero tolerance !
i don 't want a war in my city
the city belongs to everyone
lf that 's all you can say shut it !
what have you got to say ?
that 's not how i understood it
you said you couldn 't ask anything more of us
oh then i should have made myself clearer
you are too personally involved
as you UNknown e just shown
let 's hope mr UNknown doesn 't file a complaint
then the world really will have gone mad !
eric i really sympathise with your loss but this is work for our cell
remove your men from UNknown 's place
i assure you once again we UNknown l do everything we can to catch the guy
huh everything ?
what are you saying UNknown ?
ls there something we should know ?
no ls there something i should now ?
and he 's never known anything so we UNknown l leave it like that then
why can 't we find the bastard ?
we UNknown e hit the jackpot twice !
the fingerprints on the knife match those on the christening scissors
our hairdresser 's called UNknown UNknown son of our first body
the UNknown clan UNknown UNknown UNknown and the son comes to avenge his father
and whoever gets in his way
fucking hell !
UNknown UNknown 's prints are on it too
but his too his too !
where 's his police record ?
he 's never been convicted of anything
no police record ?
not from here
they 'r e from an old case that was dropped
there 's no court file just a police file
file k 1 UNknown
there were expenses UNknown to the file
they can be found in the accounts
here two lab UNknown
i 'm afraid it is
this already almost cost me my job once
it 's not looking good now either
we receive a sample i have it analysed
it 's UNknown UNknown
so we receive a new sample
i do the analysis myself and guess what it 's UNknown sugar
good job your lot didn 't make a fuss
the suspect 's lawyer didn 't either
who was the lawyer ?
i keep everything
and i 'd like to know who brought the sample in
i can tell you that
it was received by UNknown UNknown UNknown
handed in by UNknown
beg his UNknown
i UNknown the vermin
you can tell me anything
you know that
this is something i have to do myself
forgive me dad
mr UNknown didn 't survive his head on collision with this monkey wrench
any witnesses ?
forensics are here
just hundreds of fingerprints on the counter
cleaning wasn 't his thing
UNknown the clan 's lawyer yes
at the christening
we had some cars towed away
get to the point
we removed an expensive mercedes belonging to a UNknown
there was a woman too in the sewer
have you gone mad ?
think of the risk !
i UNknown e seen his body
he was executed like a traitor
UNknown UNknown called him a rat
did he work for the police ?
words of a UNknown
i 'm afraid that your father was indeed in contact with the police
yes i know
at that time the police suggested a deal to your father
i wanted to spare you the shame
then i UNknown e got bad blood on my hands
you acted correctly
you avenged blood with blood
as the UNknown teaches us
and if i find out that you
you do that
UNknown UNknown has threatened my blood
he 's leaving my house now
honestly have you seen the time ?
can we come in ?
no not really
you were his lawyer in the deal with the sugar
i 'm bound by professional UNknown
you UNknown e got a daughter naomi ?
ls she in trouble ?
where is your daughter ?
none of your business
our villa in UNknown
i 'm busy
that man is a pain !
what are we going to do ?
what if they start shooting at each other ?
then with a bit a luck the problem will sort itself out
what if they start talking to each other ?
they 'r e on their way
taking a look round can 't hurt
drop your gun
you UNknown e got my word of honour
we UNknown e got to grill him now
are you serious ?
he doesn 't know that yet
we UNknown l grill him now
UNknown UNknown had to become an informer to protect his son ?
that was the deal
but UNknown found out
he used an UNknown expression
lf a UNknown flies over 30 times and UNknown on your head 29 times and only once on your neighbour 's what proof do you need ?
you told him that ?
you were UNknown 's lawyer
he suspected someone from the UNknown clan
they didn 't even have to get their guns out
i told them everything
and as thanks you abandon him in the restaurant
of course not
we called off that day 's meeting
and left UNknown to eat on his own
we informed UNknown straight away that it 'd been called off
he knew it was cancelled
i got a fright when i heard about the murder
you were suddenly involved
why were they in my name ?
why de UNknown ?
they asked what name the booking was in and so
the first name i thought of was UNknown
it was a joke
for a packet of sugar
because you 'r e a real bastard de UNknown
and we 'r e going to get you !
UNknown check all investigations of UNknown UNknown with de UNknown in charge
start with the past two years
look for failed operations procedure errors cases dropped that kind of thing
the UNknown clan is bigger of course
i don 't need to state the obvious
of course not
the whole thing stinks !
it wasn 't just the sugar
de UNknown let UNknown do as he pleased while he came down hard on UNknown
d UNknown ou think he 's in UNknown 's pocket ?
i 'm looking into his finances UNknown 's too
it 's to protect you
didn 't UNknown UNknown and UNknown UNknown all threaten you ?
what are you thinking of checking my finances ?
d UNknown ou think this is about money ?
the UNknown were busy taking over the entire city
all the UNknown together united under UNknown
not just the underworld
the statistics made the politicians extremely nervous
so what do you do ?
UNknown the UNknown ?
buy information ?
threaten them ?
seen concentration camps UNknown
with a couple of years full board in UNknown prison ?
there 's only one strategy left
it 's as old as julius caesar
divide and rule
that 's your interpretation UNknown
no ignoring three kilos of coke isn 't a matter of interpretation
law and justice are not always the same thing UNknown
ln exchange we got a grateful daddy UNknown as our informer for life and that 's worth more than three kilos of coke
you knew it wouldn 't last
that UNknown would catch on
so what ?
they 'r e all UNknown anyway
we can use people with your potential
i 'm no good behind a desk
shame cos that 's where things happen these days
modern day UNknown isn 't about arresting UNknown on the street
but about a feeling of safety communication statistics
and naomi UNknown ?
what are you then pal ?
that 's a serious accusation
i wouldn 't repeat it without concrete proof
ls he still there ?
hasn 't the council reached a decision yet ?
commissioner UNknown ?
he 's ready to testify
lf you go and get him
we UNknown l do the arrest and paperwork
then we UNknown l turn mr UNknown over to you
that 's clear ?
are you calling UNknown a liar ?
as long as UNknown stays inside we can 't do a thing
and if he comes out ?
come on hurry up
i 'm not going to imagine anything
what d UNknown ou want UNknown ?
i wonder how come ?
take me with you
start now then
once there you UNknown l forget them
you have to trust me
UNknown and UNknown have both put their case
it is up to the honourable interpreter of the UNknown to dispense justice
he 's ours !
take care of our colleagues
go home UNknown
but i have with you
linda de UNknown
i went after UNknown UNknown
she tried to protect him
he killed her
yes i am a man of honour
then step away from UNknown
i need him in order to punish the real UNknown
and i need him in order to do my duty
to avenge my father 's murder
i can 't allow that UNknown
i know mr UNknown
UNknown has got three more kilos
he wants to talk to you
you 'r e starting to really get on my nerves UNknown
you tried something but it failed
everyone is dead
we 'r e here for a funeral
you weren 't planning to give a speech sir ?
of course i was
i 'd keep it for the media after the funeral
here 's the text
you really should see a doctor
how long are you going to iast in here ?
a week ?
and then ?
he was scared it would ail come out
the sugar and everything he 'd fixed for us
when UNknown realised there was an informer UNknown UNknown was sacrificed
happy now ?
absolutely no legal UNknown
sooner or later UNknown will be released
ln this country most likely sooner
the sort of justice he favours doesn 't require a court
ls that a threat commissioner ?
just advice from a fellow team member
ready to salute !
if you are not there
my flesh and heart may fail but you are the rock on which i build you are the future that awaits me
far from you there is no life
for those who have turned away from you everything is lost
you are the highest good and now i may rest in peace
for ever and ever
turn it UNknown
i want tu
retrieve it at the UNknown
i can 't see shit

and all a thrill with a great sincere love visions to her how they two might go on through life together
one heart for one heart one soul for one soul one love for one love even through eternity
at last the UNknown over UNknown love only to be UNknown by the stark ghosts of her past
i am only trying to say i love you anna it seems i UNknown e always loved you !
so she tells him he must never speak like this again
the summer goes the winter comes we cannot UNknown the year nor can we rule the UNknown of fate nor all its strange ways steer

maria poole from belden was at the sewing circle and she says
it 's that
on their way to the big party they stop to warm up at the squire 's with an old fashioned dance
no i am not invited to the party
the professor dazed but happy
all bound 'r UNknown a UNknown string !

life 's UNknown and sweetest
the camel that gets lost in it becomes UNknown or dies
a raiding party commanded by captain UNknown
left UNknown in the direction of UNknown
the scouts on the UNknown
captain UNknown mr UNknown
captain UNknown will investigate the UNknown saint UNknown mission
last heard from at latitude 26 degrees north
war offlce UNknown UNknown UNknown by horseman
lieutenant saint UNknown 1st regiment of UNknown UNknown
your companion captain UNknown ?
it 's number 54 !
hide the hammer the silver hammer !
the wounded man is brought to the nearest post while the column continues its mission
the officers club at UNknown
apparently saint UNknown is gravely wounded but there is no trace of UNknown
as for UNknown i think there is little hope of ever finding him
i am particularly touched as UNknown was one of my best friends
he had a generous soul and so enthusiastic
after a time of mourning
he requested and obtained a three year leave from duty
at the monastery to which he had come
he was attached to the team working on the famous atlas of christianity
after those years of UNknown
to test the UNknown of his commitment
the abbot asked him to re enlist in the army
UNknown accepted a mission at UNknown
which he considered his final test before returning to the cloister
to forget the things for which he was not made
he had the soul of an apostle and his destiny was to die an apostle
he doesn 't know it was me
he doesn 't know !
to explain the mysterious end of captain UNknown
now what ?
they say he spoke such strange phrases in his delirium
but why would he have killed his companion ?
lieutenant UNknown UNknown mr UNknown
i am a friend of lieutenant saint UNknown
we were in the same graduating class
i maintain that he is incapable of committing a disloyal act
much less an abominable crime
lieutenant saint UNknown 's official report
and on the 27th captain UNknown was UNknown by UNknown and was buried with my help in the banks of the UNknown UNknown
gentlemen you see as well as i do the UNknown that remain in this affair
but since they are impossible to verify
i judge it best to hush up what would only be a useless scandal
from the first days of his UNknown
saint UNknown sensed from the UNknown of his comrades their horrible suspicions
happy to announce you have been granted
one year of UNknown by the UNknown command
the soil of africa which he thought he was leaving forever slowly fades away
but after a while
the mysterious attraction of wide open spaces
and always this memory
three months later
lieutenant UNknown UNknown UNknown commander of the post
this monotonous life of the UNknown posts
how i envy the adventurous life of those who can UNknown themselves in the alluring mystery of this desert which lies before me
by the decision made on 1 may 1914
lieutenant UNknown de saint UNknown UNknown is assigned to the 3rd UNknown and appointed commander of the post of UNknown UNknown
lieutenant saint UNknown commander of the post
do they think that we are a dump ?
staff sergeant lieutenant saint UNknown is my classmate
a month later
the trail that goes to UNknown UNknown r and UNknown !
and which i will soon take again
dear friend your projected expedition in the UNknown of the UNknown has been agreed upon and i think you will receive your commission within a few weeks
and this time i am going alone
every day saint UNknown left the post
for long rides in the desert
he sought the UNknown impatient to go forth into it
and often night caught up with him on his way back
the night is heavy
and that night lieutenant saint UNknown told the story
and when you know where i am going
you will tell me if you still wish to come with me
i saw captain UNknown for the first time in UNknown
we were supposed to ride together to UNknown UNknown
where our routes would UNknown
my faithful guide UNknown UNknown who knows all the trails of the sahara
one of the only survivors of the massacre of the UNknown mission
at the well of UNknown
having left UNknown on august 3
right away we established a very deep friendship
after the difficult crossing of the great UNknown
on the 27th we arrived at the well of UNknown that sinister memory
and UNknown UNknown told us of the horrible tragedy that he had witnessed two years before
lieutenant UNknown had left the convoy with his adjutant
to UNknown the wells
was holding the adjutant 's UNknown
firing the adjutant shot off two fingers of the UNknown but
the convoy deprived of its white leaders gave little resistance
lieutenant UNknown 's body was never found
as we were reaching the desolate region of the UNknown mountains
there were warnings of an imminent UNknown
but never has a greek inscription been discovered at such a low latitude !
a cry for help in the distance
it 's a UNknown from UNknown
could it be that i have UNknown the goal of my mission ?
raiders from the from the UNknown sons of bitches
assaulted me and stole my camel
UNknown UNknown is my name
you saved me
you know what that is ?
answer the captain !
so we will go our separate ways earlier
this man has told me that similar UNknown are in several caves
of the western UNknown
you seem to have no idea of what the UNknown is
nor of the UNknown one can have there
where is the spot to which you proposed to bring the captain ?
i have not offered to take him there has asked me to
we are going to go south through the UNknown
UNknown UNknown will take us there
call me and i will tell you
towards the mysterious UNknown
UNknown the terrible UNknown plant that does not forgive
UNknown UNknown died during the night without UNknown consciousness
in the evening they must leave their mounts at the foot of the rocky wall
when will we arrive at the cave with the UNknown ?
we are there
they were taken with a strange UNknown
those signs are recent
it 's a mystery !
it 's UNknown !
waking up in the UNknown
how long have i slept ?
is this a deaf mute ?
UNknown was woken by a servant who was also completely silent
after having passed through the hands of UNknown and UNknown saint UNknown
they didn 't even forget my red ribbon !
loud voices that seemed to come from the floor above them
speak or i will wring your neck !
it 's lieutenant UNknown
for six days he has refused to take any food
and disappeared at the well of UNknown ?
your old friend UNknown ?
did he go right or left ?
open up !
to see her through this door even if only for a moment
lost in the maze
that is her answer
saint UNknown for his part was beginning to lose patience
where is my friend ?
very amusing i agree
the palace UNknown
although he has reasons to be agitated
you must forgive my friend for distracting from his work
a man of eminent scholarship
you are here at the center of what long ago was the isle of atlantis
in the catastrophe that UNknown atlantis 9 000 years ago
the center of the island was not flooded
after the UNknown sea dried up this marvelous oasis
was isolated from the rest of the world by its band of UNknown mountains
and this book of plato the only complete remaining copy of in the world
established this part of the island as part of the UNknown of today
in this mountain neptune locked up his beloved UNknown
the UNknown of antinea !
under the authority of whom you have come forever !
as far as i 'm concerned this isn 't the time for historical discussions !
i 'd like to know what this lady antinea wants from us
and what kind of relationship she has with the government of UNknown !
you will find out !
the red marble room
following a procedure unique to the UNknown
their mortal remains were plunged in a UNknown plastic bath
that turned them into those gold statues
how come he is here ?
what did he die of ?
like all the others and those of tomorrow
he died of love
others die sweetly in the ecstasy of opium
and all of them accepted it ?
all of them gave up ?
only one tried to escape and succeeded
but two years later dying of thirst he came back
he wandered searching for the entrance to the mountain
and returned to submit to antinea 's law
as soon as you have seen her family homeland honor
you will renounce everything for her !
and your friend the captain does he look like you ?
this is UNknown UNknown my private secretary
UNknown UNknown show him to his quarters
thank you UNknown UNknown
i am not hungry
UNknown UNknown means 's mall spring
my room is above yours
if you need anything just knock
UNknown is then brought to the door of the leopard UNknown
you will give 20 gold pieces to UNknown ben UNknown
what are you planning to do ?
nothing 's keeping me from being UNknown in the marble room
with number 27 or 28 if she pays attention to you first
antinea pays attention to rank
the inner sanctum
when antinea has one of us in her power does she lock him up with her ?
if you don 't see him it 's because he prefers to stay next to her
condemned to live in the queen 's UNknown
UNknown locked himself in his dream and did not even seem to notice her august presence
who is this man from the west capable of staying true to a memory or an idea ?
wounded her majesty ignored her beauty powerless for the first time
antinea sensed a new sentiment growing in her
every day she came to cheer the solitary prisoner with her UNknown song
and among the stories that UNknown told most often the one she found most beautiful was the story of her life
if i am but a slave here in the past
in gao the old capital of UNknown where i was born my house was the UNknown
my father descendant of the last kings of UNknown
was chief of the village
one day a sorcerer who came from the east
was dancing the UNknown in the plaza
he saw clearly that i was the daughter of a prince
because of my rose UNknown necklace
some days can be bad for you but no matter what
one distant day you will see gao shining
but the splendid gao of the past with the mosque with five UNknown
then the time of deliverance and royalty will have arrived for you
but one night most of the men were gone to the market in UNknown
that night was gao 's last
surrounded by the UNknown raiders the sleeping village of UNknown
then there were cries which once heard could never be forgotten
then the women began to fall
and given to antinea who was always good to me
i only want permission to see my friend again
you are asking me the only thing i cannot give you
that evening there was no wind to refresh the heavy atmosphere
and the night was going to be stormy and heavy
an astounding event
and UNknown ben UNknown who was preparing to meet them
was ordered to do nothing !
now it was impossible to doubt
for the first time antinea was in love
go and see what the captain is doing
no he didn 't say anything
he 's reading
come on hiram UNknown let 's go
hiram UNknown !
saint UNknown arrives before the queen 's UNknown
taking advantage of the UNknown caused by hiram 's interruption among the guards saint UNknown slips in unseen
leave him since he is there
go get the captain
during your captivity you have UNknown but one desire
and you know which one !
i asked you to see my friend again before i die
for the last time remember that you breathe only as long as i love you
i will make you die in torture that you cannot even imagine !
i am your prisoner
my friend does not fear death
i will do anything you ask
in the shadow you could not see who struck you ?
however you know him well
didn 't you ask to see your friend again before dying ?
lord forgive him as
saint UNknown continued his tale
and lieutenant UNknown UNknown was taken by the same contagious rapture
as his brother in arms
when i awoke the sun was already low
the mail from paris
i tried to remember
that day camel riders coming from the north were making a delivery on antinea 's UNknown
suddenly i saw the light
and i came face to face with the horrible reality !
mistress here are the UNknown
give him a burial following the law of his god
you are just in time
the magazines just came in
a little information if you please
i neglected to ask mr UNknown the date and place of his birth
let me pass your mistress has called for me
i was expecting you
should i bring you the silver hammer ?
you handle that one better
it was dark wasn 't it in the room where he was ?
so he could not have known it was me holding the hammer ?
if he had not known it was you
the affair would not have had any importance for me
saint UNknown 's room now had a guard
and even UNknown UNknown could not come close to the prisoner
in the oasis in the mystery and the refreshing shadow of the date palms
me too since i have been here i have wanted to leave
i have never dared to talk about it with the others
all of them only thought about her
but you tried to kill her
but how ?
i want to see gao again the blue gum trees the green water !
if you back out now i will leave by myself
when you arrive at the bottom open this box which contains UNknown
then i will know that i can come down
you are tired lieutenant
the little lady is careless
in three days all three of you would have died en route
i have marked the wells
try not to leave the trail
by any other route you will be captured tomorrow and killed
at the perimeter breach
to let compassion take UNknown over duty
and remember that you saved my life
don 't thank me you are mistaken if you think
that you will see your world again with the same eyes as when you left it
one day like lieutenant UNknown you will again walk
through the same corridor through which you have just passed
thank you UNknown ben UNknown and goodbye
goodbye lieutenant saint UNknown
the UNknown camel was calmly grazing
the day after tomorrow we will be in sight of UNknown UNknown
there we won 't have to worry about water anymore
you will come with me to gao
you will see the trees in bloom
they felt their lives were also departing with the animal 's last breath
they had only one measure of water left and 60 kilometers still separated them from the next well known as the three palms
at dawn on the seventh day the horrible torture of thirst had begun
take heart UNknown
i can feel it !
head uncovered UNknown the fearsome sun
cover your head !
then the time of deliverance and royalty will have arrived for you
at daybreak the tomb was covered
and i went on towards the south at random
and when on the terrace of UNknown UNknown saint UNknown arrived at this point in his tale the night was almost over
and i was found dying of thirst by a patrol commanded by captain UNknown
you know the rest
but i see her i speak to her
i will throw myself at her feet and tell her
we must hurry !
asks to talk with the commander
it 's a UNknown
peace be with you UNknown ben UNknown
you can speak
and one evening on the trail to the south they were seen moving away
on their way to their destiny
intoxicated with the sacred attraction of mystery
in a state of ecstasy that the certainty of not coming back made sharper and greater
four stories by UNknown UNknown adapted for film by carl th
UNknown directed by carl th
UNknown cinematography by george UNknown
so goes the legend of UNknown
and god said to satan the fallen angel
you fell because you wanted what even i did not want
in your pride you tempted men
satan you shall continue your wicked work amongst humanity
go out among them take their shape
and whoever UNknown to your temptation shall be judged by me
and whenever your temptations are resisted
you shall be relieved of 1000 years of your punishment
the first story
it happened during the last days
of the UNknown of christ upon this earth
on the second day before UNknown
the priests and the UNknown were gathered in the house of UNknown
the teachings of christ had offended the UNknown and UNknown
who found the ground prepared for his evil seeds
took the form of a UNknown and went to UNknown
UNknown UNknown UNknown
in the home of simon the leper
jesus UNknown UNknown
who feared the favour jesus had won with the people for is miracles
i am just out of UNknown where everybody speaks of jesus
after the raising of lazarus from the dead
jesus is UNknown everywhere as if he were a king
but UNknown is secretly grieved to see that the seed he has newly sown
is already beginning to bloom
if we let him go on in this manner everybody will believe him in the end
and our temples will stand empty
the UNknown of jesus
and dried them with her hair
why was this ointment not sold for three hundred pence
and the money given to the poor ?
but jesus UNknown judas saying
let her alone
but the UNknown claimed with one voice
that UNknown should let jesus be seized and slain
your will shall be satisfied
woe to him who UNknown us
he must die !
god 's son is what he calls himself
the devil s son is what he is and you have been tied by the power of the devil
we shall meet tomorrow at noon tide outside the golden gate
i know you will come
the next day was the first day of the festival of the UNknown bread
judas had spent a sleepless night
UNknown by the doubts put in his head by the UNknown
but towards noon he felt
as if a will stronger than his own
directed his steps towards the golden gate
i mean no ill by you only the salvation of your soul
but on this day the disciples had come to jesus and asked im
where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the pass over ? and jesus answered
go into the city and there you shall meet
a man carrying a pitcher of water follow him
you suffer and it is his fault he promised you a UNknown UNknown but he is not god s son only a man
i cannot do it
when the romans sound the second change of the watch
and when the hour had come
he sat down to eat and the disciples with im
and when they were eating he said
verily i say unto you
one of you will betray me
master is it i ?
and he broke the bread dipped it and gave it to judas saying
that thou UNknown do quickly
and jesus blessed the cup
jesus and the disciples went out to UNknown
but at the same hour
men of the jewish temple guard went out at the bidding of UNknown
to seize jesus and roman soldiers accompanied them
lord where are you going ?
we are tired et us stay here
and jesus rose from is prayer and went back to the disciples
but found them asleep with sadness
how am i to know jesus ?
the kiss of friendship shall be the sign
and jesus prayed
but jesus said
and jesus asked
but jesus asked once again
who are you searching for ?
and jesus said
but UNknown the fallen angel whose whole heart was set
upon finding favour again in the eyes of the UNknown
he was grieved to see his evil work completed
and his grief was deeper because it had fallen to his lot
to deliver the son of god into the hands of human UNknown
but the lord s voice was heard
continue thy evil doings
about the horrors of the torture chambers of the inquisition

circumstances that i cannot explain
have compelled me to take this decision
it is with grief that i leave this house
whence i take the most cherished memories of my life
for isabella and manuel the weeks passed as if in children s play and the day came when manuel must resume his duties in the war
at the same time

on the 14th october UNknown
marie antoinette was taken before the revolutionary UNknown
the trial lasted two days
when she returned to her cell
during the night between the 15th and 16th
the jury had unanimously sentenced the queen of the french to death
on UNknown square
while the day was slowly dawning
marie antoinette wrote her famous tear stained letter
to her sister in law princess elisabeth
the letter which has passed into history as
marie antoinette 's testament
this letter to you my dear sister will be my last
i have just been sentenced not to a disgraceful death
for it is disgraceful only to criminals
but to leave this earth to join your brother
innocent like him
another woman was writing
at this moment i can hear the death cart rumble into the yard
to take my mother to the scaffold
these lines are my last appeal to you
UNknown is the soul of a conspiracy to liberate the queen
help him and i shall forgive you and bless you in my last moment
take this to joseph with my final farewell
of the miserable clothes left to marie antoinette
at one time the most beautiful lady in france

it is her you have to thank
for me making a traitor of myself to the republic
yes i remember the young woman well
where is she now ?
she has been beheaded ?
who was callous enough to hand that child over to the UNknown ?
be quick !
and do not think of yourself
but of wounded vanity in the flare of a moment s anger
joseph forgets his solemn vow to UNknown ve and the queen
whose fate had been entrusted to him
now she is being prepared for death out there
is that good enough for you ?
three women s UNknown have been betrayed by you
three lives you have wasted
murderer is your true name just like UNknown is mine
eternal damnation to you

which paved as they are with dashed hopes
seem to carry him further away from his eternal salvation
for him there is no mercy
anew is heard the voice from above continue thy evil doings !
UNknown by a young woman fighting the russian eagle

when the red UNknown made its way from russia
across the UNknown frontier ?
our last story takes place in the little town of UNknown
which was partly occupied by the reds in the spring of 1918
the white UNknown corporal UNknown receives orders from his commander
to lay telephone and telegraph wires
across to the railway station of UNknown corporal UNknown christian UNknown
if you will not be mine
i shall inform on your husband to the red tribunal
next day corporal UNknown on his way to UNknown
thank god you came
UNknown goes into the woods to gather bark
for baking with flour
hat s mother
the red tribunal
UNknown is represented by the russian monk ivan
who has rushed to the aid of his UNknown red brothers
against the bloodhounds of the white guard
UNknown UNknown UNknown
let him have a bullet when you get into the woods
and now for a bite to eat
ivan has turned the schoolroom of UNknown into a lecture hall
and there is always a UNknown audience
when he gives his social lectures
UNknown has fought a fierce battle with his own conscience
but it is as if a power beyond his own control drags him
towards the school house of UNknown
now i know how to avenge my father
take me to your commander at once
i want to join the UNknown army
the red catechism
you need only obey one law
the one you make yourself with the blood of the rich
where do you live ?
i no longer have a home
you must give an address anyway
where the body may be sent if you are killed
it makes no difference to me
as long as i am buried in UNknown soil
may the pact you are making now be a blessing to you
one evening about a week later
just after the last train had left UNknown
in the red headquarters
i il tell you
by telephone and telegraph to the station
we must catch UNknown off his guard
and force him to draw the whites into an ambush
the reds have occupied the railway line
you can UNknown them
don t do it UNknown
you are now going to die
but even the worst of sinners has a claim
to be comforted by religion
well armed with hand grenades to meet a UNknown
does she now belong to me ?
will you not reconsider while there is still time ?
dear god !
your husband s life can no longer be spared
but there is still time to save the lives of your children
this is my last warning
if you refuse your children will be dead in the next instant
UNknown s simple heroic deed released UNknown
from a thousand years of his doom
but the doom pronounced by the ord
was written with the characters of eternity
and its words urge UNknown on to new goals new fates
i got to change these bandages
yeah well try not taking my skin off with them
how 'd i score the house call dr
my conscience is fine thanks
of course what have you got to feel guilty about ?
i mean you just let that damn arab torture me
stood by and watched
only reason you 'r e here
i 'm here because no one else wants anything to do with you
it 's been two days since sayid took off on his own
i keep looking up thinking i 'm gonna see him coming back
he UNknown l come back when he 's found what he 's looking for
the french transmission
he left because of what happened
because of what he did
it was an accident
sayid 's a trained soldier kate
he can take care of himself
he 's drinking our water
what 's going on out there ?
uh you know the usual
people yelling at each other over nothing
doc what do you think this is this uh this rash ?
it 's bad right ?
like some kind of a tropical disease ?
it 's hives
it 's a common rash sometimes brought on by heat and stress
just try to relax
isn 't that for UNknown or something ?
try to keep your mind off it ?
what else has that guy got to do but stress ?
i have enough on my plate without having to treat UNknown
yeah well that 's like my point man
we 'r e all fried
i mean have you taken a look at everybody out there ?
everybody 's way tense
i don 't know something to do
we 'r e surviving here hurley
and that 's my main concern is keeping us alive
things could be worse
where is alex ?
UNknown r UNknown mes questions UNknown que je UNknown faire a UNknown la UNknown e
je t 'a UNknown qu UNknown n UNknown d j la v UNknown
mais je UNknown que tu i 'a UNknown
and all the pain will stop
your UNknown friends have already UNknown you in the bombing
you planted the device in the party 's headquarters didn 't you ?
you killed two soldiers !
he doesn 't know anything
your sources were wrong
you handled yourself very well in there
did i ?
you 'r e my superior officer omar for now
and i UNknown l enjoy it while it lasts
that reminds me sayid
that is if you won 't miss being a communications officer
i am willing to make that sacrifice
they must have fallen from the plane
what are you guys doing out in the jungle at night ?
best time to hunt
he spotted some tracks looked like they might be rabbit or some other UNknown
for a bit
not gonna happen man
i keep telling you i don 't know who alex is !
i 'm a survivor of a plane crash
i found the wire on the beach
i followed it
you you just happened to hear my distress call ?
i know what you are
i read it
those batteries they wouldn 't be able to produce enough power to transmit your distress call all these years
broadcasts from somewhere else
i don 't know who you think i am
i UNknown e already told you
i am not sayid ?
how do you know my
my name was on a jacket
yours is on the envelope you carry
who is she ?
she 's a known associate of UNknown and UNknown UNknown
you think she knows who UNknown the bombing ?
well that my friend is exactly what you will find out
UNknown UNknown UNknown
if you refuse to cooperate i 'm going to hurt you
do you understand ?
you of all people should know that
am i so different from the little girl in the UNknown who used to push you in the mud ?
and i 'd answer because he UNknown me
you had enough attention with your family 's wealth and your charm
such things matter little to children
but then you always were older than your years weren 't you sayid ?
not old enough to understand that being pushed in the mud was a sign of affection
now you 'r e a traitor to your country
tell me what you know about the bombing nadia
tell me or i swear i will hurt you
oh i know sayid
this is where they burned me with acid
they pierced my hands with a drill
would you like to see the soles of my feet ?
where they UNknown the skin off
these are UNknown of your friends
the people you swear allegiance to
if you were innocent i 'm sorry
but this bombing is a different matter
then i 'm going to hurt you
i was a soldier
it was a long time ago
tell me more about her the woman
i 'm bored !
i 'm in the middle of something
but there 's nothing to do around
well you got to figure out stuff to do know what i 'm saying ?
you got to find a way to entertain yourself
so you heard my transmission came looking for me for answers
i didn 't know you were alive
you claimed there were others
more than 40 yes
i left them
and nadia you left her too ?
she wasn 't on the plane
she 's dead
see this junction here UNknown some of the spring 's water flow into a couple of suspended UNknown
pop in some holes you got showers
this way you keep the drinking water separate
this is you drew this ?
i was an artist in a previous life
i thought you were in construction
said we should come see it
welcome to the first and hopefully last island open
hurley you built a golf course ?
rich idiots fly to tropical islands all the time to whack balls around
all the stuff we got to deal with man this is what you UNknown e been wasting your time on ?
i mean we 'r e lost on an island running from UNknown and monsters UNknown polar bears !
polar bears ?
look all i 'm saying is if we 'r e stuck here then just surviving 's not gonna cut it
we need some kind of relief you know ?
we need some way that we can you know have fun
that 's right fun
it 's a music box but it 's broken
has been for a long time
it was a gift from my love for our anniversary
you mean alex
i could fix it for you
i could take a look at it if you freed my hands
i 'm fairly good with mechanical things
i UNknown l need my hands
what is written on the back of your photograph ?
what are you doing ?
did she write it or did you ?
perhaps you don 't want to tell me because it causes too much pain
rousseau you don 't need to do that
this is a problem man
no chance !
you won 't get anywhere near us !
listen that rash of mine is starting to spread
it 's like the size of a UNknown
what are you guys doing ?
are you playing golf ?
you offered to fix my music box
after all i UNknown e done to you striking you shocking you
your first name
we were part of a science team
a science team armed with rifles
was robert on the team ?
our vessel was three days out of tahiti when our instruments UNknown
it was night
so we made camp
two months before your distress signal the message i heard you said it killed them all
we were coming back from the black rock
it was them
have you seen other people on this island ?
i think you UNknown e been alone for too long
i 'm sorry
i UNknown l try and bring you some fruit later on
are you ready to talk ?
that depends on what you 'd like to talk about sayid
i 'm afraid my conversation will suffer
we have two suspects in custody
have a look at these photographs
all you need to do is nod
if you prove you 'r e willing to cooperate
i think i can get them to free you
then i won 't have these visits to look forward to anymore
this isn 't a game nadia
yet you keep playing it sayid pretending to be something i know you 'r e not
you 'r e never gonna believe this
you finally learned how to tie your own shoes ?
are you high ?
i don 't know about you guys but i 'm gonna go check this out
wait for me UNknown
what 's next cop eating a UNknown ?
if you want to come you should just say
i think i UNknown l UNknown that freckles
not big on crowds
one outcast to another
you can 't
you need me
if we 'r e lucky it 's one of the bears
if we 'r e lucky ?
it might be that thing out there
you have to execute her
this will send a message to the others who will not talk
i just need more time with her
you have had more than a month sayid
now bring her outside and shoot her or i will
is this a problem ?
put it on
dude i think you stuck it
i almost didn 't recognize you
you 'r e smiling
so how 'd you come up with this ?
wasn 't me
i haven 't been sleeping because i want everyone to feel safe
he builds a golf course and everyone feels safe
ah crap !
you got to get the UNknown
you left me alone at the caves
she 's sleeping
i just i just got caught up
i 'm really sorry walt
i screwed up
hey you wanna play ?
oh no don 't worry about it
they won 't mind
michael it 's your shot
you 'r e up
put the gun down danielle
put it down on the ground
what what 's going on ?
40 meters outside this door there 's a supply truck that will be leaving shortly
they don 't check them on the way out
only coming in
they won 't reach the city for 30 minutes
that 's enough time for you to jump out and hide yourself
come with me
i don 't have your courage
you have more than you know
nadia you have to go
they UNknown l kill you !
and then you shot me
you already have
robert didn 't notice it was missing either when i shot him
but you loved him
i had no choice
i couldn 't let that happen
i won 't !
i can 't let you go
don 't you understand ?
to have someone to talk to to touch
you UNknown l find me in the next life if not in this one
i know what it 's like to hold on to someone
i UNknown e been holding on for the past seven years to just a thought a blind hope that somewhere she 's still alive
but the more i hold on the more i pull away from those around me
the only way off this this place is with their help
come with me
your people the ones you 'r e determined to get back to watch them
watch them closely
sink this you get to wear the UNknown
mate you betting against me ?
sorry dude but you 'r e a UNknown like me
make it 10 and you 'r e on
i don 't have any cash but i UNknown l bet my dinner on the doc
i got two tubes of UNknown and a flashlight says he chokes
i UNknown l take that action
we need the UNknown princess
does your father know you 'r e here ?
can you teach me how to do that ?
somebody please help me !
what is it ?
we got to find out who did this to her
don 't worry
won 't let anyone get to you
i 'm not sure anything actually happened
it 's not all in her head
you think i 'm making this up ?
it was safe at the beach !
don 't do this !
if she stays UNknown out like this it could trigger an early labor
how do i get down there ?
our daughter was conceived onboard an alien craft
she is of incredible importance to them
pull back !
that was my grandfather 's legacy craft bodies
you want to know what scared me so badly ?
yes damn it i want to know what you saw !
then look at me mary
look at me !
i know the feeling
what 's the meaning of this ?
do you see it ?
there was nothing
this little girl can manifest a thought
she asked me to read it to her
could you ?
then tom gets a message to me about where to meet him
remember i said we didn 't have a signal on allie that we didn 't know where she was ?
right now !
lisa i 'm your grandfather
your grandmother gave this to me a long time ago
make him stop !
stop it please !
they 'r e with somebody
with somebody ?
a guy in his UNknown
his eyes turned black and they shot him
they were waiting for her to demonstrate
they see she 's got the power and bam !
they 'r e here
you are paying attention
she left in a dodge durango
still doesn 't make you look very good does it ?
you take a nine year old girl and a special ops unit into the american UNknown you lose the girl you come up with nothing
you 'r e in the deep end
you 'r e right in there with me i have to go back to washington and explain what happened here
find me the girl and whoever she 's with
how 'd you like us to do that ?
the little girl 's weak
this being who came to help her has been shot
you UNknown l have a definite advantage
smooth sailing i 'd say
just do it
then find me i UNknown l take it from there
try not to screw things up
i know that
let 's find a place to get some i UNknown l tell you my theory of everything
she UNknown l be all right
will she ?
you UNknown e gotta do something to change all this i just want my little girl back
you started all this and you don 't have any more of an idea where it 's gonna end than any of us do
just give me a minute i want to talk to you
charlie you 'r e hurting him
give me a minute
why have you been doing this ?
what the hell do you want ?
we 'r e just trying to understand
understand what ?
we were all scientists
our idea was to find out everything your history your biology everything
we came here to learn
we 'r e not that different from you UNknown UNknown but what you call evolution has changed us
we see things in you that we no longer recognize in ourselves
they 'r e this energy that can manifest itself in different ways as the beings we UNknown e seen as their UNknown as our thoughts
there 's no right or wrong about them
the idea that the things we were doing were cruel
john to the UNknown the UNknown your ability to hate to love to feel
you have compassion as well as cruelty
we lack both
UNknown in their brains like the animal that lives far back inside all of us
but an experience of something basic can awaken that primitive thing
your grandmother sally she took me in and showed me a great kindness
and so our greatest experiment began
could they put it back this thing that had been bred out of them for UNknown and UNknown ?
mary step in the evolution of life
the experiment was an UNknown success
what do you think is gonna happen next ?
allie goes with us
that 's never gonna happen
you still don 't get it
this thing you saw in my grandmother this compassion our humanity you still don 't have a clue what that means
allie is my daughter
you will never take her away from me
she can 't stay here lisa
she did too much if she uses her power again that part of her that 's us it will kill her
you were right
it 's the only place for her
that is what 's next
no it isn 't
let it go
we should be able to catch up with them tonight
tomorrow morning at the latest
we UNknown e taken it all the way together haven 't we ? i don 't know what you mean
we 'r e gonna be there when it comes together
we 'r e gonna know we did our part
our part ?
you 'r e fine with that aren 't you ?
them finishing their work i can 't wait
that 's all you want right ?
front seat at the show ?
they 'r e more highly evolved than we are
she 's more highly evolved than they are it 's the way of the tao
nature takes its course
then we lose
yeah pretty weird
i didn 't ask anyone to make me special
woman on radlo
allie showed him his boy
we all saw him clear as day
your uncle should have seen the ad we put in the paper by now
talk to me
my friend ?
good to see you too
is this him ?
what kind of adventures you been on lately ?
a lot 's been goin on
oh yeah ?
i thought we 'd go into mexico through texas i got a guy down in el paso
he 's working on the documents
he 's gonna meet us at my mum 's old place in UNknown
i was thinking that you guys should go down to south america i UNknown e got a family there who can put you up indefinitely in buenos aires
it 's a big change but i just think it 's something you have to do
this is all supposed to be going somewhere that 's all
mexico sounds like a good idea
what do we do about him ?
he doesn 't look too good i don 't think we UNknown l have to worry about him much longer
but UNknown we do evey plan we make is kind of a lie
we 'r e closing our eyes and pretending the day won 't even come when we won 't need to make any more plans
hope is UNknown biggest lie UNknown is and it is UNknown best
you UNknown to keep going as ifit all UNknown o else we wouldn 't keep going at all
country western music on radio
want a UNknown bar ?
are they good ?
they UNknown e got a lot of sugar in them
you eat food don 't you ?
i could have done that
but you didn 't
how do i make this stop ?
i mean if i couldn 't do any of those things then people would leave me alone wouldn 't they ?
i don 't know that much about people
is there anything i can do ?
i 'm not important
you UNknown l be afraid and you UNknown l be alone
you 'r e becoming more than you already are
i 'm not going to go with you
i belong here with my family
i brought this for you
what is it ?
she gave it to me before i left
i can 't do this much longer
i already told him i wasn 't going to go with him
what did he say ?
he gave me this
you 'r e gonna be a little girl again i promise
hey back together again
i 'm never gonna let you go honey
i 'm betting i can get a shot into her before you turn the gas station into a flying saucer or a house of pies
allie don 't try to do anything
do you understand ?
i think you know what they want you to do and i don 't think you want to do it
i can take care of you
i can keep you safe from your friends
we can work together on this
i don 't want to hurt anybody
i really don 't
you must have realized that by now
i have the resources and technology to help you
it 's me or them
i just want to help
you 'r e lying
let 's go
get in !
it 's not safe !
i didn 't do anything !
you 'r e damn right
she 's staying here with us !
that was too close
those people from the government when you went with them you said they put something over your head
if those people know enough to block that signal then they know how to read it to track it
you have one too lisa
that 's how they found you in seattle
there 's not much point in going to buenos aires is there ?
no matter where we go they 'd find us
you can shut her off can 't you ?
you can do something so they won 't be able to track her signal or mine
if you can do it then do it
you owe us that much
i can 't do it
i don 't have the strength
but allie can
can you ?
you 'r e weak
the music helps me concentrate
we 'r e not picking up their signals
i was gettin to it
do you think allie did it ?
check this out
lights in the sky
don 't you get it ?
you want to talk about what happened at the parking lot ?
you were gonna shoot her
i was going to stop her
that 's not up to you
you 'r e not gonna let it go are you ?
i can 't
you look at her and you turn to stone
unless you know the secret which you have to be an enlightened warrior to learn
this is going somewhere right ?
if you know the secret you can kill her
and then the winged horse
UNknown flies from her head and the world becomes a very very beautiful place
i used to think we could get something out of this
a new science something
but we 'r e not ready to be anything but spectators in this
anything more stone
i 'm gonna find her and i 'm gonna be more than just a witness to this
man on radlo
like all you UNknown UNknown saying UNknown maybe UNknown isn 't some evil UNknown UNknown all
i always say
is it all coming to a lead ?
UNknown UNknown UNknown in UNknown sky
and a little gil is out UNknown UNknown on UNknown UNknown
UNknown 's in ou UNknown and UNknown las ou UNknown
UNknown is william UNknown saying
keep UNknown UNknown skies and UNknown fo an UNknown UNknown doesn 't UNknown
i never should UNknown e let her shut us off
all right all right
nobody 's gonna find you here
what about john ?
my friend will be here by then with the papers and we can move on
what are you doing ?
i can 't stay with you anymore
if i 'm here sooner or later you UNknown l be found
now that you UNknown e turned your signals off once i 'm gone none of us will know where you are
you mean no one will be able to find me ?
i can 't promise you that
then at least you UNknown l get the chance to be the little girl you said you wanted to be
but if things get too difficult if you feel that you can 't stay here any longer you can find us again
you UNknown l know
we UNknown l hear you and we UNknown l come for you
but unless you call us we won 't be able to find you
i 'm the one that 's gonna know ?
when the time comes it UNknown l be your choice
what i UNknown e learned from doing this what 's changed in me
i would never never do any of this again
this is all my fault
it wasn 't mine to meddle
you wouldn 't have been able to do it if you weren 't supposed to
i 'm very glad i got to see you
good bye allie
just to the edge of the woods
this is as far as you should go
good bye allie
how do you UNknown that that 's allright that everything changes ?
how do you find a way for that to make you feel good about life instead of breaking your heat ?
the latest thing you UNknown l even learn is how to say good bye
he did something and just left !
no i don 't think so
i think she was about to give out anyway
i think he left to protect her !
i had this feeling about john something he was feeling
when john showed allie how to block our signals
i think he made it so the aliens couldn 't find us either
but as long as he stayed with us sooner or later they were gonna find us
he was part of them
i don 't know
so we should take it
maybe they don 't know where she is either
that 's a thought isn 't it ?
you can 't be serious
what if they 'r e lookin for her too ?
her signal disappeared and then her mother 's
and then the lights appeared
how 's that possible ?
she 's with one of them
the man driving the UNknown was tom clarke lisa 's uncle
yeah i thought i recognized him
he 's gettin a little long in the tooth
i had the office UNknown my grandfather 's files everything we have on tom clarke
my my grandfather went to texas once
yeah and got the UNknown scared out of him by jacob clarke right ?
tom still owns his mother 's farmhouse the one my grandfather went to to get jacob
you think that 's where they UNknown e gone ?
i 'm all for takin a look
what if they 'r e there mary ?
then what ?
tom clarke this is chet UNknown
i 'm calling you with a warning
i want to help you
they took you right ?
this goes way back for you
i 'm gonna go inside and see how allie 's doin
camera shutter clicks
i UNknown e explained a bit of the situation to the local authorities
they UNknown e agreed to yield jurisdiction
how 'd it go in washington ?
in my years as a commanding officer
i find i get the best results from my people when i don 't refer to them as incompetent idiots
people perform best when they 'r e not UNknown with self doubt
the joint chiefs seem to favour a more direct approach
we got 48 hours to find the girl
i want to thank you for UNknown up captain
colonel UNknown wasn 't up to the challenge something this this unusual
thank you sir
it 's one thing to expect something captain quite another to have it bite you in the ass
that is one cold and nasty bitch
clearly she knows where the little girl is
i imagine she and the doctor both knew but there was a difference of opinion on what to do about it
that is one cold and nasty bitch
i made a call to my guy
he UNknown l be here as soon as the papers are ready
probably be tomorrow
what is it ?
then he got cut off
probably just some sort of bluff get us to move too quickly
i already made that call
this way miss crawford
for the authorities to feel comfortable handing you over yeah they are
i want that on the table
i understand that
so let 's get to it then
you knew where the little girl was and you chose not to tell me
you wanted to keep her for yourself
i thought i 'd use her to re establish my power base
what changed your mind ?
he thought that this was it they 'r e coming for allie
why don 't they just take her then ?
because at the moment they don 't know where she is
she 's with one of them the one from the gas station
maybe he 's the one who turned her signal off
maybe he 's protecting her
why would he be doin that ?
she escaped with the help of that alien
allie didn 't do a thing
it sounds like she didn 't have to
then for the moment they can 't protect her
for the moment
i want to finish what we started
after everything you UNknown e done
you know what the stakes are general
he was going to warn her
warn her ?
you want to take these off ?
this is what we didn 't want you to know
you UNknown e taken this away from me before and it blew up in your face
get our people out of fort ash and down to texas
but maybe they could be stopped
maybe something could happen that would make it had for them to do what they wanted to do
how is she ?
it 's just a matter of time
well there 's no point in running unless we have a place to run to
something like this the government can only do because nobody 's watching
that 's what you always said
who are you going to call charlie ?
i 'm not going to call anybody
if this next caller 's who i think it is folks we 'r e in for a real treat
tom clarke back again it says here on my screen
to what do we owe the pleasure ?
did you find something in idaho ?
talk to me and i UNknown l talk to you
it 's about that little girl the army 's been looking for
we been gettin lots of calls about her
the people who have been calling are telling the truth
i know this little girl
i was hoping your listeners could help us out
i believe we have a lot to talk about tom but i have to pay my bills first so if you 'd just hang on you still there tom ?
i 'm here
this little girl
what can you tell me about her ?
for UNknown she 's my niece
it 's done
this little girl she 's a piece of the sky my friends
have you been taken ?
well so has she
same 's true of allie
this little girl
the government believes it
they can do what they do because they can do it in secret
they don 't have to stand in the light of day
if you 'r e on the road tonight turn your car toward the state of texas
if you 'r e in bed get up and get dressed because they 'r e not gonna be able to touch her if there are witnesses
the UNknown must be on the road already but we have to get out there first to save this little girl
so many of you call me e mail me write to me and you 'r e starving for an answer
you want to know why you were taken what this has all been about
we UNknown gonna save one child
my friends and
tom lisa you should come see this
their UNknown is a little girl
her name is allie
we have come here to texas to see this little girl and to understand what 's been going on for all these years
super secret missions government UNknown involving UNknown and aliens ?
it may all be a bit hard to swallow but jeffries is not alone in his belief
how 's your niece ?
one of these people happened to be a doctor
she 's in there with her right now
can she travel ?
i UNknown e been taken repeatedly since i was seven but i i still don 't even really know what we 'r e dealing with here
this might be something better suited to their medicine than to ours
we UNknown l we UNknown l find a way to help her here
you try to be strong for your kid you know ?
i 'm your mum
i can keep you safe
but really you know there 's nothing you can do
you can 't keep them safe from anything at all
hey you UNknown e done a lot
we 'r e gonna be all right
tom 's got it all set up for us
his friend brings out the papers and we disappear into the sunset
i spent my childhood disappearing
i 'm pretty good at it
denny heard about it on the radio
god is she all right ?
no she 's not all right at all nina
it was a series of miracles that 's what it was
but what we saw and what she did
i 'm with these people
after what i did to them i 'm here with them
they were able to forgive me
that 's because of her
this is as close as we can get without getting the attention of the crowd
we UNknown l treat this like a riot situation have the guards go in first get the crowd out of there
still you gotta admire the move
we 'r e tryin to fly under the radar and they put up a wall of people between us and the little girl
she must really mean a lot to those folks
goin through these lengths
i guess i didn 't UNknown it which i guess means you UNknown me
i kinda saw that one comin
you must be UNknown in fo the final wing ding about now
there 's something i wanted to share with you
we 'r e all so desperate for meaning
aren 't we ?
you want answers and in that way
i think the aliens are gonna disappoint you
here 's the stone truth of it
they 'r e still asking the same questions we are
no one is god here
we 'r e all in the same boat
that was our life together wasn 't it ?
we asked questions
i used to love the way you 'd get that faraway look in you eye whenever you were workin UNknown out
we could have been happy
that 's another question for them
isn 't it ?
why do we do the things we do ?
allie belongs with them
it would destroy us
you 'r e UNknown your head right ?
as soon as i heard what was happening with the little girl
i i knew i had to be here
how long do you think you UNknown l stay ?
as long as it takes
and you ?
it 's kind of hard to explain if you haven 't been taken but we all knew we had to be here
the girl allie is inside this house
some say she 's resting others say she 's dying
the question we haven 't been able to answer yet is what does she mean to this group of UNknown people who believe they UNknown e been taken ?
we have a car waiting for you in the woods
an old back road leads all the way to highway 177
dale and i took it this morning
it leads all the way past the army
we came out on the other side
they weren 't any the wiser
you ready ?
if anyone tries to hurt our little girl they 'r e gonna have to come through us first
i don 't want you to do that
just for a moment
bill please help me get these people
she 's just not ready
you all right ?
we 'r e going someplace where none of this matters okay ?
everything 's ready
honey honey you don 't have to do this
all you have to be is my little girl
the rest of it it doesn 't have to happen
you don 't have to do anything
they 'r e scared
i think maybe i do
you have something in your heads
it lets them know where you are
i can shut them off
when they shut off they UNknown l fall out
don 't be scared
they won 't be able to find you
no one 's going to take you
it doesn 't seem right to uh interfere with us the way they did
maybe not to us but if we saw this from someplace else it was just time for this to happen
they 'r e not gonna do anything !
there 's too many of us here !
do you want to help ?
stay in front of the porch !
go to the mayor now
get me the wireless unit
please make yourselves available for immediate UNknown to a UNknown area
you vehicles and personal belongings
you don 't listen to that !
it 's a lie !
you stay right here !
stay right in front of the porch !
right here !
stay right here
we 'r e stronger together !
stay in front of the porch
just so you know a lot of us are armed and willing to give our lives to protect allie or take some if we have to
get out of here now
put your plan into action
we UNknown l do what has to be done
we better get back inside
john left that up to me
do you think if we 'd been regular people
charlie would have lived with us and we could have been a family ?
i know that would have happened
i don 't want to go
i want to stay here with you
then stay !
we can get out of here right now !
it UNknown l be okay
give the command
i don 't want that to happen because of me
then we UNknown l go away
we have a plan
this would all just happen again
allie allie listen to me
i am not gonna let that happen
we 'r e gonna get charlie and we 'r e gonna get out of here
we UNknown l figure out a way
there 's nothing we can do
we 'r e a family now
we can try
yelling and screaming
i want to be a little girl !
i just want to be a little girl !
i love you
i have to go
i won 't let you
i won 't let you go
you you said this was all meant to be
and i meant all of it
this part too
i have to go
i love you honey every day and twice on sundays
i love you too mama
is she makin this all up ?
is this just another screen ?
this is no screen general
this is real
can you stop them ? !
we can 't
i 'm sorry
even if we lose the little girl at least we UNknown l still have this
sooner or later we UNknown l know what they know
she deserves that much
i don 't know what i 'm going to be what i 'm going to learn but what i do know is this
it is wanting to see what 's over the next hill that keeps us all going
we have to keep asking questions wanting to understand
even when we know we UNknown l never find the answers we have to keep on asking the questions
no i didn 't
sir shall we pick up the mother and father ?
the mother and father ?
you 'r e talkin about the little girl 's parents ?
yes sir her parents
i don 't see them anywhere
neither do i sir
i don 't see why not captain
there 's nothin for us here
thought you might want this
she did all right UNknown
she took the other one with her
she took the other star
she 's gonna be back charlie
she really is
she liked to watch the clouds in the day and the stars at night
especially the stars
we would imagine darkness or a blinding light or UNknown else that we didn 't know how to name
there 's nothing beyond the sky
the sky just is and it goes on and on and we play all of our games beneath it
just before it gets dark
when the light still hangs in the sky
the day 's not quite come
all its promises still in your own eyes
between the time your mother calls
and the time you put the ball away
there 's a lifetime to be lived
and a world where every dream is here to stay
just before the night comes
and you run back to the safety of your world
just before it gets dark
you can believe in every story ever told
in those last precious moments
there 's a beauty no one wants to give away
well nothin lasts forever
just before it gets dark
before you grow old
just before it gets dark
and you know your dreams will not come back again
it UNknown l all be all right
i promise you baby

but why the devil are you interested exactly in that one ?
i 'm a much tired wanderer
i wish to make me a garden here

the stranger 's request gave rise to a fierce debate among the UNknown ; but the gold he offered was highly appealing
the stranger 's proposal was approved unanimously and he was granted the graveyard land for ninety nine years

lf death frightened me i wouldn 't have been a rascal
may i know when did you decided to let cancer poison yourself ?

have you done anything which is against your conscience ?
we rascals always
have you ever taken any money which you shouldn 't take ?
haven 't you courted any girl whom you shouldn 't court ?
have you killed innocent people ?
have you sold anything which you shouldn 't sell ?
you are not fined by laws so you punish your UNknown
so cancer is going to kill you do you understand ?

yet o allah i obey his command UNknown by your words
i let him take me each time i push him away he quotes you
they ask thee concerning women 's courses
say they are a hurt and a UNknown
so keep away from women in their courses and do not approach them until they are clean
but when they have UNknown themselves
ye may approach them in any manner time or place ordained for you by allah
for allah loves those who turn to him constantly
and he loves those who keep themselves pure and clean
o allah most high
i feel at least once a week the strength of my husband 's fist on my face
o allah most high
my husband supports me from his means therefore i am UNknown obedient and i guard in my husband 's absence what you would have me guard
but my husband UNknown and protector fears disloyalty and ill conduct on my part ; he accuses me of being ungrateful to him ;
he always finds a reason to doubt my loyalty to him
and after a series of threats and warnings he starts to beat me
o allah most gracious most merciful
just as you demand of the believing woman i lower my gaze and guard my modesty
i never display my beauty and ornaments ; not even my face or hands
i never strike with my feet in order to draw attention to my hidden ornaments not even at parties
i never go out of the house unless it is absolutely necessary ; and then only with my father 's permission
when i do go out i draw my veil over my bosom as you wish
once in a while i sin
i UNknown about feeling the wind through my hair or the sun on my skin perhaps on the beach
i day dream about an extended journey through the world imagining all the places and people 's out there
of course i shall never see these places or meet many people because it is so important to guard my modesty in order to please you o allah
so i cheerfully do as you say and cover my body from head to toe except while i am in the house and with family members only
in general i am happy with my life
however things have changed since my father 's brother UNknown is staying with us
he waits till i am alone at home and comes to my room
then he orders me to do things to him touch him in places most intimate
since he is with us i took to the habit of wearing the veil inside in order to UNknown him
that doesn 't stop him though
twice now he UNknown me ripped my inner garments and raped me
when i told my mother she said she would take it up with my father
but my father ordered her and me not to question his brother 's honour
i experience pain each time my uncle comes to see me
i feel caged like an animal waiting for slaughter
i am filled with guilt and shame ; and i feel abandoned yet i am surrounded by family and friends
the verdict that killed my faith in love is in your holy book
faith in you submission to you feels like is self betrayal
o allah UNknown and UNknown of life
you UNknown all who believe to turn towards you in order to attain bliss
i have done nothing my whole life but turn to you
and now that i pray for salvation under my veil you remain silent like the grave i long for

our coach declined to train the national team
and the UNknown coach and UNknown coach don 't want the job either
what does that have to do with UNknown UNknown ?
oh gosh !
everyone knows you were better than her
oh mi sook
i don 't need your pity !
she 's the UNknown coach and i 'm sure you all know her
she was on the team that won the gold at barcelona and silver at atlanta
she 's currently coaching the hiroshima UNknown UNknown team in japan
under her leadership UNknown became three time champions
and here 's assistant coach kang soon il and trainer jung UNknown soo
please introduce yourself to the team
i UNknown e got one thing to say to you girls
you should be ashamed of yourselves
you UNknown e got the worst record out of all the previous national teams
you barely made it to the olympics
if you girls don 't get your act together you won 't even get through the first round
there 's only way to beat european players who are physically bigger than us
you UNknown e got to run faster and play as a team
sports critics say that korea uses simple UNknown but that 's all we UNknown e got
we have to practice harder and longer
what the ?
i didn 't ask you what your name is
how could you be late on your first day of practice ?
what kind of attitude is that ? !
she just got back from UNknown today
she UNknown in the world junior UNknown championship in UNknown
you must be tired
change into your uniform and get back here right away !
she 's the youngest player on the team but on the court she 's a leader
she 's pretty good
over here !
if you commit a foul inside the line you 'r e out of the game !
bo ram !
UNknown is a team sport !
your left wing was open
why didn 't you pass the ball ?
the defender was blocking my view so how could i ?
what 's with your attitude ? !
you need to have some sense beaten into you !
UNknown can 't beat up players any more !
what the ? !
but you have to spend two extra hours practicing tomorrow !
that 's all !
coach you 'r e working too hard on your first day you know
stop kidding around
we UNknown e got some fresh young players
but the players are too inexperienced and the offense needs a total UNknown
i don 't know where to start
why isn 't mi sook on the roster ?
oh she has some personal problems
what kind ?
she 's the reason why i think marriage sucks
what brings you here ?
the team is in terrible shape
and the young players don 't have that winning edge
i heard about your situation from soo hee
we need you on the team
you said soo hee told you everything
but if the team wins the gold medal you UNknown l get a cash reward
if you pay me the cash up front i UNknown l join the team
no no no
my husband will take it all
let 's drop the subject
but she 's a better player now
she 'd love to be on the team
coming right up
here you are
would you be more careful !
why 'd you throw it like that ? !
why couldn 't you catch that ?
are you ok ?
i told you to just stay home and relax
why are you making things more difficult ?
do you know how boring it is to do nothing all day ?
then why don 't you work out at a gym ?
don 't ever mention UNknown again !
will you stop calling us ? !
we don 't do deliveries so stop wasting my time
how many times do i have to tell you ?
i 'm hanging up
actually she never mentioned food
she said she was from the UNknown UNknown
you idiot !
i 'm at the UNknown training center
the best of the best
the word didn 't get around to you eh ?
oh i 'm just calling for old time 's sake
hey why do you sleep so early ?
it 's past 12 !
do you have to wake up everyone to brag about yourself ?
i UNknown l call you again
i didn 't hear you
what the !
i should slap her silly
i am the one who can 't sleep !
i can 't sleep either
you can 't jump high if you walk like that !
she made a bad impression on her first day
she 's a star player but the coach is always on her case
yes coach !
i 'm here for practice
you didn 't miss me ?
thanks for arranging the cash advance
it came in handy
keep up the pressure !
oh UNknown !
go defense !
my back !
that wasn 't an offensive foul
hey if your back isn 't killing you then get up !
how will you win the gold ? !
oh we UNknown e got a long way to go
she 's trying to kill me
since when did this gym become a home for the elderly ?
the old UNknown think they own this place
what now ?
what the hell did you say ? !
you said you heard me loud and clear !
what the ? !
you 'r e dead !
damn it !
let go of my hair !
when will they grow up ?
break it up !
that insolent bitch
you 'r e dead
what 's going on here ? !
you bit me !
you don 't have to apologize
players get into fights now and then
i UNknown e seen it all when i was a coach
don 't worry about it
that 's not why i came anyway
so i thought about hiring UNknown UNknown pil as the new coach
cha bum UNknown is korea 's greatest soccer player while park chan ho is the best korean pitcher
in UNknown UNknown UNknown pil is the best
so what do you think of him ?
but you promised to appoint me as coach if i did a good job as UNknown coach
what did you promise her without clearing it through me first ?
don 't try to wiggle your way out of this
coach kim i thought the players would do better under a female coach
but it 's not working out that way
and coach kim why didn 't you mention your divorce ?
what does that have to do with coaching the team ?
it 's not a trivial matter
coaching the national team is a public position
divorce is not taken lightly in our society
would you reject a male coach if he had a divorce ?
i don 't care who you choose as the new coach
pick whoever you want
soo hee it 's not your fault so don 't be sorry
what gives ?
it might hurt your pride to be a player but it 's better than nothing !
this is our last chance to play together as a team
she 's right UNknown UNknown
if you and mi sook play as forwards we can win the gold again
don 't let your pride get in the way
it 's out of the question !
i UNknown e got my self respect
UNknown UNknown !
you convinced me to join the team because you said it was in shambles
but now you 'r e just going to leave ?
i haven 't played UNknown for months
i 'm not fit to play
i don 't buy that
you were the toughest player on the team
you can get back in shape in no time
is it because they chose UNknown UNknown pil over you ?
what ! ?
i 'm UNknown UNknown pil
i played on the national men 's UNknown team when i was 20
and my next goal was to coach the national team some day
today that dream has come true
dreams really come true
european teams that have taller and stronger players ?
soo hee ?
i think we need to move quicker and play as a team
we need to follow the korean UNknown of opening up shooting opportunities
no that UNknown is UNknown
it doesn 't work in international UNknown
nowadays you need to use creative team UNknown
i 'm going to do away with old fashion training methods that wear players down
we UNknown l adopt a european training program that 's efficient and logical
so let 's work hard to reach our dreams for olympic glory !
do your best !
yes coach !
what 's up ?
i 'm doing fine
coach don 't worry about us
if you win the gold medal it UNknown l feel like we won it too
oh i appreciate that
they sell UNknown in japan too !
don 't go if you don 't want to !
who said i didn 't want to go ?
i know what you 'r e thinking
don 't do something that you UNknown l regret later in your life
that 's a lesson i learned in life
move to your right
i UNknown e seen turtles move faster than you !
how 'd you get picked to be on the national team ?
that was pathetic
can 't you see she 's nervous with all the cameras pointed at her ?
so i 'd like you to cooperate
but how will that improve our game ?
how can you change your playing habits after years of training ?
lady you UNknown e got a big mouth
do you expect me to call you young lady or something ?
starting today you have to UNknown all the old habits you UNknown e learned
no more UNknown from now on
we UNknown l follow a german UNknown program and all of you will undergo mental training as well
we UNknown l have a UNknown put each of you on a high energy diet
your exercise programs will also be UNknown
what is he talking about ?
to be honest i was shocked when i saw the player roster
the association included senior players from UNknown 2 and UNknown 6
since we 'r e using the same players our opponents know what to expect
dong UNknown come here
i 'm sorry
we 'r e sorry
how could they cut in line like that ?
they 'r e an embarrassment to the team
hey those ladies are tough cookies
they should retire and give younger players a chance to play
what if they get chosen as UNknown over us ?
you 'r e on the UNknown team right ?
song jung ran
i 'm following your coach 's orders
if you don 't like it then talk to your coach
what ? !
long time no see
you look older
you don 't look that young yourself
people still tell me that i look young
that 's a joke right ?
but why do you have to join the team now huh ?
you just love getting under people 's skin
i came because i had my reasons
so get off my back ok ?
how can i look the other way ?
the older players are the hardest to handle
oh my !
the new coach changed everyone 's UNknown
do you grind your teeth or snore at night ?
oh gosh !
i UNknown e got a suggestion
european players can penetrate our current formation
we need to use a pyramid formation even if it 's tougher on the players
and i played as a pro in europe
i know their UNknown better than you
i 'm just concerned
yes you can !
why don 't you leave him at a UNknown center ?
and who will drive him there and pick him up every day ?
oh he had to take care of some business so i came instead
oh i see
i 'm doing fine !
i hope you UNknown l win a gold medal !
oh not now !
we know what kind of food to eat
we 'r e old pros
how can we endure the training when we 'r e always hungry ?
but you know the coach is really cute
he looks like a greek statue
hey get rid of that
you 'r e making me lose my appetite
i heard you two were inseparable
why 'd you break up with the coach ?
why are you bringing up the past ?
i 'm trying to eat here
was the coach mean to you when you used to date him ?
hey drop the subject
it 's ok
oh it 's so bitter
well i have a brother in law who sells herbs
this is made from exotic ingredients
i get UNknown whenever i drink this
it 's made from dog meat black goat liver badger meat UNknown and
what the !
why 'd she ?
how could you eat dog meat ? !
you think you 'r e a saint eh ?
what a bitch
it 's not good for kids
where were you ?
i told you i was giving an interview today
four athletes failed the UNknown test in the entire training center
and all four of them are your players
how could you let this happen under your watch ? !
our whole country would be disgraced if they got caught at the athens olympics !
you probably know better than to drink medicinal herbs
so tell me why you shared the tonic
i didn 't share it with them !
they stole the tonic from me !
listen to me coach
so i started to get suspicious
i was going to confront them about it but now i know who did it
hey you even called me an animal for drinking it !
i never imagined that you 'd steal from me
what should i do with you eh ?
shut up !
but women become weaker at a faster rate than men
so i don 't understand why certain players were chosen to be on the team
coach everyone can see us
after UNknown everyone 's physical performance
i will ask those players who perform below average to leave the team
coach are you really going to kick out UNknown players ?
we can 't pull out soo hee because she 's the only UNknown we UNknown e got
we UNknown l end up kicking out some of the younger players
will that be ok ?
what do you mean ?
oh come on coach
are you ms oh soo hee ?
i look better from a right angle shot
but that picture was taken from my left side
i UNknown l make sure to pose correctly for my future wedding photos
so he said he 'd take me out for dinner next time
thanks for setting up the blind date
if things work out i UNknown l treat you to lunch okay ?
bye bye !
are you out of your mind ?
she told me she 's a UNknown player on the national team
so i naturally thought she earned a lot
but she earns less than a teacher
hey think about it !
she 's not pretty or young you know
yeah she 's tall
why is it so hard to find a hot date ?
i just met him an hour ago
everyone 's in the pot ?
he 's not here
call your dad
yeah right ?
hey place your bets first !
he 's bluffing
tell him to eat three meals a day
i UNknown l give him your money if he comes by
could you tell him to call me once in a while ?
he hasn 't called for days
why doesn 't he even take my calls !
i 'm not a debt collector !
let 's go !
hey UNknown UNknown
running a business isn 't easy
mr choi is a UNknown con artist
he even has a criminal record
he takes advantage of people like you who UNknown e played ball all their lives !
what did you do yesterday ?
i met some friends and
athletes should never go on drinking UNknown
i 'm sorry coach
i had to pull strings to kill that news article !
i 'm really sorry
of course not
you can 't bring him with you to athens you know
why can 't you girls get your act together ? !
this is why korean athletes get no respect
i 'm sorry for being late
my daughter had a fever so i had to
leave the gym !
didn 't you hear me ?
get out of here !
hey UNknown pil !
don 't UNknown UNknown me
i 'm the coach
don 't you have any compassion ?
did your mom abandon you when you had a fever ?
are you crazy ? !
you don 't know anything about the players and their personal problems
all you talk about is kicking someone off the team
coach song wasn 't like that
he remembered everyone 's birthdays
he knew that hyun ja was caring for her sick dad and that jung ran couldn 't get pregnant
do you even know that ?
why do i have to know that kind of stuff ?
your husband got cheated by his business partner and is on the run from debt collectors
i can 't believe you !
if it weren 't for a favor that the association did for me
i would have punched you in the nose already
what kind of favor ?
the cash advance you got ?
don 't let that stop you
trainer kang said it 's not from the association
why would the association do that for you ?
you didn 't even win a medal yet
it seems that UNknown UNknown made a lot of money in japan
i wouldn 't have joined the team if i were gonna quit over this
i don 't care about my pride
what 's the matter with you ? !
do you get a kick out of making a fool out of me ? !
what are you talking about ?
i 'm here because i UNknown e got no choice
so what 's it like to be rich ?
i 'm sorry about that
but i needed you on the team
that 's all
i did it because i needed the money
that 's what UNknown means to me
it 's my meal ticket
that 's nonsense
do you know how hard i tried to be as good as you ?
i practiced two hours when you practiced for an hour
i thought i could catch up to you if i kept trying
but no matter how hard i tried it was never enough
and you know why ?
because you were the best
you were born to play UNknown !
it 's meaningless to be the best !
you don 't know what life is like in the pits
i have suicidal thoughts every day
yet i swallowed my pride and came here so that i could support my kid !
but i can 't stand it any longer
i 'm ashamed of my life
i UNknown e had it !
you 'r e not the only one who has pride
sun UNknown !
wake up !
don 't play games with me kiddo !
why can 't you follow him ? !
there you go !
if the national team loses to a high school team
the game isn 't over yet
why isn 't UNknown UNknown a starter ?
and where 's mi sook ?
is she sick ?
coach what should i write in the report ?
write whatever you want
we 'r e going to practice when we get back
got that ? !
huh ? !
UNknown is a team sport
you can 't just blame one person
are you picking a fight with me now ?
just carry the water jug okay !
hyun ja why didn 't you tell the coach that you 'r e having your period today
if i did i would have lost my starter spot
i couldn 't tell him
don 't cry girl
and you girls
you UNknown l end up having no kids like me
so we learned something valuable today
don 't feel bad about it okay !
how could a bunch of high school kids beat the national team ?
it takes some time for the players to adjust to a new training method
even UNknown UNknown had a hard time when he first UNknown in korea
speaking of which
and the director of the training center is unhappy that the UNknown team is doing things differently
i had a hard time UNknown him !
but that 's your job
sonny you UNknown e got a big ego
sir watch what you say
i 'm coach UNknown UNknown pil !
coach UNknown !
stand up !
sonny ? !
i can 't waste my time on these useless meetings
so just e mail me about meeting results
since when did he become so arrogant ?
he 's an arrogant fella alright
oh i 'm so tired
hey UNknown players
get up you bitches !
don 't you see our jackets over there ?
move it !
she can sit wherever she wants
who are you ?
don 't mess with them
come on !
i UNknown l poke you in the eye !
hey if i see you picking on our girls again you 'r e gonna get it !
got that ? !
is it funny ? !
who are you guys ? !
we 'r e on the judo team
just eat your food !
what are you doing in mi sook 's room ?
we got new uniforms so i brought one here but then
i saw how messy the room was so i 'm cleaning it up
look straight ahead after you pass the ball
hi coach !
oh dong UNknown
i feel better these days
i don 't know why i got so UNknown out before
it 's nice to coach kid in a small town
i have time to think and watch the clouds pass by
i knew there was something odd when UNknown UNknown came by for a visit
i tried to make him stay longer but he left the very next morning after i called you
i don 't care where he is
i came to see you coach
don 't hold a grudge against UNknown UNknown
he 's a young guy so he 's taking it pretty hard
he UNknown l get back on his feet
oh your son
dong UNknown !
your lap times will be included in your performance scores
so keep that in mind
and i 'd like to announce that mi sook has been taken out of the starting lineup
wait a minute !
under the rules she 's UNknown from playing on the national team for a year
she knows the rules better than anyone else
as the coach i decide who will be a starter
alright try to run the course in less than an hour
that 's impossible !
don 't act like babies
i can finish the course in 55 minutes flat !
if you 'r e so confident then why don 't you run against me ?
if i beat you to the finish line then put mi sook back in the lineup
and if you lose ?
if i lose
are you insane ?
i 'm not a senior player and
hey shut up !
what did i say ?
oh gosh !
what 's your decision ?
it 's a great deal for you
get ready !
this is point a !
point a !
turn back !
you should just give up !
you 'r e gonna get hurt !
don 't talk down to me !
i have to lead the team to victory so could you help me out here !
i UNknown e got a coaching job waiting for me in japan but mi sook doesn 't have anything to fall back on if she quits !
since when did you care about other people ?
as i recall you were extremely jealous of mi sook !
that was true back then
but after having a kid and coaching players
i learned to be compassionate
a selfish obnoxious guy like you can never understand that !
you think i 'm selfish ? !
you UNknown e got a big ego !
and you 'r e also a coward !
i 'm a coward ? !
you left for europe instead of facing my disapproving parents !
and you lay the blame on the players all the time !
let me give you some advice from one coach to another
if the coach doesn 't believe in his players he UNknown l never win a game !
it 's impossible !
what 's the time ?
go where ?
this isn 't time for cracking jokes
there they are !
UNknown UNknown !
UNknown UNknown keep running !
UNknown UNknown !
UNknown UNknown !
i 'm ok
you UNknown l be late for practice
bo ram i 'm fine
so go to practice
it 's the ball from the UNknown 7 UNknown
did i give this ball to you ?
i can 't believe this !
how could my career end like this ?
this isn 't right
hey mister !
will you be quiet back there ? !
oh you girls just never know when to stop
if you leave like this you UNknown l create another headache for me
you have to process your papers before leaving the center
write a report stating your reasons for leaving !
then come to me for my signature !
UNknown UNknown i 'm going back !
hey wait for me
what are you doing ?
i 'm keeping my promise
just stay and finish what you set out to do
remember the barcelona olympics ?
the team won the gold while you were UNknown with an injury
you cried on my shoulder that day
you 'r e doing this to make up for that right ?
if you were a guy i would have kicked your ass already
what are you doing ?
why are you just standing there ?
come and practice with me if you want to get repaid
isn 't that mi sook ?
mi sook !
oh mi sook !
you can 't get through me !
block her !
i missed you a lot
if you run away again i UNknown l kill you
why aren 't you girls UNknown ? !
there are only a few days left until the olympics !
where 's your focus ?
we UNknown l start UNknown to the local time in athens
so from now on you girls will sleep at 4 am and wake up at 11
lunchtime will be your first meal of the day
any objections ?
but mi sook will be suspended for not showing up for a week
do you have a problem with that ?
no coach !
so we need to move to the UNknown quickly
got that ?
it was really hard to buy
you can have it
i 'm giving it to you because you need to increase your UNknown
i UNknown e never heard of this brand before
can 't tell if it 's good or not
give it back !
i knew you 'd succeed in whatever you did
how is my wife doing ?
you should go see her
she 's very worried about you
oh i can 't look her straight in the eyes
i just need to know if she 's doing fine
is she playing well ?
i never made mi sook happy during our marriage
not for a single day
the only happiness she gets out of life is when she plays UNknown
do you think i 'd have a good time drinking with you ?
it 's not much
and could you give this to dong UNknown ?
i UNknown l get going now
i hope you win that damn gold medal !
the women 's UNknown team made it to the olympic UNknown
that 's right
today they UNknown l be facing brazil
the female trio UNknown lady of kim UNknown UNknown han mi sook and song jung ran
i 'd like some extra UNknown
you 'r e giving up UNknown chances !
but don 't break away from our formation !
always stay in your positions !
don 't get too excited !
alright ? !
hey you ladies !
did you lose it or what ?
we hear you coach
one two three !
what the ? !
don 't move
you fouled her on purpose !
jung ran cool it !
jung ran !
she deserves a red card !
red card !
mi sun come over here !
you 'r e playing
hyun ja !
your team played well !
well done !
coach UNknown !
so let 's beat denmark tomorrow and win this thing !
thank you sir
so we have to watch out for that
so only soo hee will throw long passes
stay around the center on defense
and one more thing
so when they have the ball
i want everyone to run to the UNknown except for the forwards
she 's very good at reading movements
so try to release the ball at the last minute when you shoot
maybe she also has debts like me
how do you feel ?
i was thinking about the barcelona olympics
hey i need to tell you something
if we don 't win the gold tomorrow i UNknown l need more time to repay you
oh don 't worry about that
UNknown UNknown why don 't you think it over ?
and i think he 's changed a little
i think you UNknown l get along with him fine
oh come on
are you dating him behind our backs ?
what the ?
maybe he asked to see me because he 's too shy to talk to you himself
that 's ridiculous
oh my gosh !
are you sleepy ?
get some rest
i 'm not nervous about the game
i 'm just depressed
none of the teams want me
hey don 't worry
you said it yourself
what did he say to you ?
he just had to screw up my life one last time
and he had to do it right before the finals
what wonderful timing !
do you like the country ?
the women 's UNknown team will try to win back the gold model after 12 years
they UNknown l play against denmark which has beaten us twice in the finals
we 'r e bringing you the women 's UNknown finals live from athens
it 's going to be a tough game for our team
i hope our players will find their winning touch
but two of our best players won 't be playing today
that 's right
and jang bo ram was injured in yesterday 's game
so she 's out
yes that 's true
give it your best shot !
don 't get hurt !
we 'r e going to win right !
one two three
fall back !
it 's 14 14
so you have to get closer to them on defense and keep up the pressure
and their left back is a strong player
so mi sun you need to mark her here
the rest of you will have to cover the center okay ?
korea is leading by one point
it 's 23 22
the game is tied with less than 4 minutes to go
our players need to move into UNknown positions quickly
penetrate their defense !
jung ran shoots !
denmark throws a long pass
with 3 minutes remaining our players are getting tired
the korean team is passing the ball
we need a goal
hey watch the ball !
hurry up !
there 's no time to explain
hey sun UNknown !
mi sook ?
i 'm going to see this through
is your leg holding up ?
tell me what happened
it 's incredible
the team was down by 2 points with 2 minutes remaining
but then mi sook came into the game and scored twice to tie the game
there 's 3 minutes left in overtime
the game is still tied at 27 27
korea has possession of the ball
the players are passing the ball
stand together !
it 's 28 27
go back !
soo hee saw the ball coming and made the save
korea is ahead by 2 points
it 's 29 27
block her !
we can win this !
the referee blew his whistle
he 's calling a foul on our player
she dived !
i didn 't push her !
how could he give them a penalty shot ? !
she fell down by herself !
what a jerk !
korea has a one point lead
there 's 49 seconds remaining in the game
no no no !
it 's a two touch !
the ball touched her and not me when it went out of bounds !
are you blind ? !
don 't argue about it come on
what a damn prick !
he referee made another wrong call
this is truly regrettable
they say that wrong calls are a part of the game
in europe the denmark team are the favorites
can you keep playing ?
let 's make some changes
i 'm not going to give up now
i 'm alright
they can play coach !
you can play right !
we 'r e ready to play !
if i can 't trust you girls then who can i trust ?
in a physical match up between korean and denmark players it 's like david versus goliath
the denmark players tower over our team
but korea won 't give up easily after coming this far
let 's go !
we UNknown e got enough time so don 't give up ok ?
are you ok ?
let me take her place
you 'r e injured
put me in the game
are you sure you won 't regret it ?
i won 't regret this coach
are you ok ?
i don 't think so
but she 's really tough
go bo ram !
shouldn 't the referee award a free throw for UNknown play ?
yes he should
let 's go !
regardless of whether we win or lose this is the finest game you UNknown e ever played
and today is the finest day of my life
i 'm proud of each and every one of you
so be confident !
one two three !
it 's the moment of truth
it all comes down to this penalty UNknown
five players from each team will take a shot
korea 's UNknown is soo hee
jung ran will take the next shot
each of the first two korean players scored
denmark 's second player had her shot blocked
both teams are tied so far in the penalty UNknown
it 's alright !
if han mi sook scores
korea will have a chance to add another gold medal
but if she doesn 't score we UNknown l have to settle for the silver
mi sook it 's okay
all of you did your best !
let 's do one last cheer !
one two three !
so i 'm very sad that i let them down
korean national team player lee sang eun we almost won the game but
i don 't have any regrets about how we played
korean national team coach UNknown young UNknown i 'm so proud of my players
they were terrific
although we only won the silver
i think our team played like winners
how could some of the players on the korean national UNknown team have nowhere to go after they return to korea ?
i just don 't know what to say
it 's not right
the phantom UNknown
at the foot of the bed stood one of her colleagues
send for david holm !
why doesn 't sister maria do as i ask ?
send for david holm !
i will fetch him
poor mrs holm !
we must prevent her from meeting that husband of hers if he comes here
this was no ordinary evening it was new year 's eve
here we can tell just when to drink the new year in
it 's strange place to see the new year in here among the dead
you gentlemen are not afraid of ghosts surely ?
then i UNknown l tell you a story while we wait for the clock to strike midnight
i once had friend called george a merry fellow
he was smarter than the rest of us
but on new year 's eve he became quite strange
remember it is new year 's eve
if anything happens to a man on new yer 's eve he UNknown l be condemned to drive the phantom chariot
it is no ordinary cart
its driver is no ordinary man but serves a harsh master called death
night and day he must drive about on his master 's errands
wherever he goes he meets grief and despair
his is a hard task
though it is always the same cart and the same horse it is not always the same driver
the man who draws his last breath as the clock strikes midnight on new year 's eve is destined to drive the cart throughout the following year
now you understand why i am afraid of having anything happen on new year 's eve
and gentlemen george died last new year 's eve
why hasn 't david holm come ?
come with me david holm
sister edith is dying and wants to see you
go to her at once
david you must take my place
help me into your cart and drive me to the hospital as quick as you can
in my cart no living man travels
when i reach a patient it is too late to call a doctor
you know very well that i am not a living man
now you must meet the consequences of all the evil you did during your time on earth
don 't you think i know david that it is my fault you came to such an end as this ?
if you hadn 't met me you would have lived UNknown with your wife and children
tomorrow you will have served your time and may go free but maybe a harder punishment awaits you
there sits your brother
but we think it is you who should pay the penalty for it was you who turned him into a murder
will this not make you repent of your evil ways david holm ?
yes for i understand how it feels to have brought misery upon someone whom one loves
what of your wife and children ?
and i had looked forward so eagerly to coming back !
why did she run away letting me return to an empty house ?
that was cruel !
now i shall take you back to new year 's eve a year ago when you came to this town
a rescue center had just been opened in the town
no i want no food i only want a bed
don 't touch it !
it 's filthy and full of germs
don 't you understand how glad i am to do something for the first guest that god has sent us ?
go to bed you are tired
i will take care of this
jesus give this first guest of ours a happy new year !
all night long she bent over the coat in the cold
she was half frozen when she went to bed
did you fix my coat ?
please find the person who did it
too bad you took so much trouble miss i 'd rather have it like this
i prayed last night that god would give you a happy new year
please come back so that i can see if god heard my prayer
i UNknown l come back all right just to show you that god doesn 't care a rap for such silly nonsense
now you shall see her again
come with me
you cannot escape your fate
all through the coming year you must gather up the souls as they leave their earthly prison
mystery drew near the house
two souls approached visible only to the girl whose life was UNknown away
i know why you are here but you have come too soon
i am not afraid but give me a little longer
there is someone i must see
he needs me i must help him
i tried to show him his better self i tried so hard
what can you do ?
you have a power over him
you hoped and believed there was good in him but have you forgotten the night in the barroom ?
it was you made him give up his job and leave his home
it was you who brought him to this
don 't let david ruin your life too
go on go and get saved !
you only want to be saved because she is a pretty girl
why don 't you get a job and pull yourself out of this UNknown
that 's a lovely idea miss all the same i 'm going away
you see i 'm looking everywhere for somebody
when i find her i UNknown l let you know quick enough
he is looking for me i am his wife
i left him
you must take him back that 's the only way to save him
come i UNknown e a happy surprise for you
she is very ill it all started that night she sat up in the cold to mend his filthy coat
she worries continually about david holm and his family
you brute to torture even little children
it is not so easy to escape is it ?
why did i bring them together again ?
i cannot die yet i cannot !
i must see him once more !
i know he would listen to me now !
if he made me a promise now he would keep it !
is death here too ?
i can 't stand it any longer !
you shan 't suffer as your mother suffered !
enough for the three of us god forgive me !
stop it !
i have no power over the living !
what can i do ?
what are the words the prayer the words ?
a sinner whose lips are stained with wickedness asks UNknown
oh break me crush me only save these three innocent ones !
lord of life and death hear me !
hear me !
forgive forgive me
the phantom carriage
at the camera
she was stricken with UNknown UNknown and she had only held out for the space of a year
when there was no hope left she had gone home to her mother
waiting at the foot of her bed was another salvation army sister who had once worked alongside the sick girl
don 't fret over those poor souls now sister UNknown
you have done enough for them
send for david holm !
please don 't !
let me have her to myself now that she ls UNknown
UNknown maria why don 't you do as i ask ?
send for david holm !
i shall go fetch UNknown at once
you can 't be serious UNknown david holm to attend a death bed ?
i haven 't been able to find him but UNknown is looking too
he will bring him here if that is at all possible
poor mrs holm poor mrs holm
i UNknown l take her back home
it wouldn 't do for her husband to see her should he come
the UNknown on which these events took place was not an ordinary one
it was new year 's eve
well we will certainly know when it 's time to toast the new year !
it 's a spooky place to await midnight here among the dead
you gentlemen are not afraid of ghosts i hope ?
then i 'd like to tell you a story while we wait for the midnight hour
i once had a pal called georges who was generally a jolly fellow
he came of a good family and had studied hard at UNknown university so he knew a bit more than the rest of us
but a change would come over UNknown on new year 's eve
remember that it 's new year 's eve the last day of the year !
whoever dies on this eve must drive the cart of death
there is an old old cart
no ordinary driver holds the reigns
he is in the service of a strict master named death
for him a single night is as long as 100 years on earth
night and day he must carry out his master 's business
end of part i
wherever he goes he is greeted with sorrow and despair
there is no escape he must perform his sorry duty
although the horse and cart remain the same the driver will vary
the last soul to die each year the one who gives up the ghost at the stroke of midnight is destined to be death 's driver during the coming year
now you know why i 'm afraid of something fatal happening on new year 's eve
and the odd thing is you see that georges apparently died last new year 's eve
why hasn 't UNknown arrived with david holm ?
come with me david holm
sister UNknown is dying and she has asked for you
lf sister UNknown wants to see you you must go at once !
david i can 't believe it 's you !
you are meant to relieve me !
you ought to lift me up ln your cart and take me to the hospital
no living soul rides ln this cart
by the time i arrive it is too late for a doctor
you know well enough that i am no longer alive
but worst of all you must face the consequences of the evil you have wrought during your lifetime
david do you think i 'm unaware that it is my fault you have met such an end ?
lf you hadn 't fallen in with me you would have led a good life with your wife children and brother
by tomorrow you will have served your time for drunken behaviour
but before you leave a UNknown punishment awaits you
behold your brother
but we feel that you ought to serve the sentence instead since you and you alone led him astray and made him a killer
does this not make you turn from your wicked ways david holm ?
yes for only now do i realise how it feels to have brought great misery upon a loved one
what about your wife and children ?
i know how miserable they felt but i will turn over a new leaf
end of part ll
no she is not ill
she was well enough the other day when she left
and here i was UNknown i would come home to her with such joy !
lf she had gone openly
i would have understood but to UNknown off like that to let me come home to an empty house that was heartless !
i UNknown l wipe those smiles off your faces
i UNknown l find her and i UNknown l teach her how it feels when your heart freezes to its very core like mine has !
i UNknown l refrain from reminding you of your search for your wife during which your feelings of hatred and revenge UNknown stronger
i will take you to a time a year ago to last new year 's eve when you came here bringing such misfortune in your wake
a salvation army station had been set up here in town
and it was ready for use on new year 's eve
keep your food !
leave it be !
we don 't have the UNknown oven going yet
don 't you realise maria how it pleases me to help the first guest god sent us ?
please go to bed
let me attend to thls
dear jesus let our first guest be blessed with a happy year
all UNknown long she bent over the coat never giving thought to the germs she had UNknown
by the time she went to bed the chill of winter had thoroughly penetrated the room
did you mend my coat ?
would you mind UNknown the person who did this ?
it 's a shame you went to all that trouble miss but i 'm used to having it like this
before you leave i 'd like to ask you to visit me next new year 's eve
you see i prayed that our first guest would have a good year
and i wanted to find out if my prayers were answered
oh i UNknown l be here
i UNknown l come to show you god didn 't give a fig for you or your UNknown
the time has come to honour that promise before you take over here
from you she contracted the disease that ends her life and now she awaits your visit
you have possessed all that is most wonderful but you have lost it !
you cannot UNknown the torment or remorse just as you cannot escape taking over as death 's driver for a year
captive take leave of thy prison !
ye spirit that left thy body at the stroke of midnight thou wilt relieve me of my office
for a year thou wilt reap souls
end of part ill
it is death but too soon
you see that i 'm not afraid of you
i will gladly heed your summons but grant me a day 's grace for there is someone
i must talk sense into
you do not know what terrible misfortune i have caused
i cannot approach the lord before i have put it right
i must tell you that the person i 'm UNknown for is the man i love
do you understand ?
i would grant you grace if it would avail you but you have no power over this man
you have tried to make him mend his ways believing he was good but your hopes have been dashed time and time again
you 'r e the one who UNknown him away from his home and his work !
you made him the drunkard he is !
don 't let yourself be dragged under !
salvation army rally
what 's the use of making such a fuss ?
i 'm a UNknown but i cough into people 's faces in the hope of UNknown them off
why should they be better than us ?
he 's merely amusing UNknown
he 's not as wicked as he pretends to be
how can you be filled with such bitter hatred for your fellow man ?
you needn 't worry about that
i UNknown l be UNknown town in a few days
no you mustn 't do that !
i would rather you stayed so i may challenge you again
however tempting that maybe i still can 't stay
you see little missy i 'm on a journey throughout sweden in search of a person i must find at all costs
who ls this person you seek ?
you UNknown l know that when i find the person in question
i am the one david holm is looking for
i am his wife
i deserted him took my children and crept away in secret
i moved to this town for it was so far from our old home that i never expected him to come looking for me here
you must take him back !
it 's his only hope !
i didn 't mean that you must make up your mind on the spot but promise me to listen to your heart and we can talk again
she had got the better of herself and asked for none of the UNknown that belonged to this world
just come with me !
a surprise awaits that will make you happy
end of part UNknown
she wanted to UNknown the seed that had fallen among the thorns and she may well have gained her end had it not been that
the doctor says it 's pneumonia
her resistance is so poor for she has had ill health ever since last new year 's eve
yes this david holm has been her UNknown
she worries so about the situation between him and his wife but she mustn 't know the truth
you might at least have the heart to spare the children from infection !
it wasn 't as easy to run away this time !
haven 't you had enough revenge ?
lf only i hadn 't brought them together again !
his sin would be of less magnitude if not for me
you must grant me grace !
i cannot die yet !
i must see him turn over a new leaf !
just spare me a few minutes !
you know i love him
i UNknown e never loved him as i do today
captive ye of loving heart take leave of thy prison
those who are to receive her will arrive shortly
you know david if i could send a message to UNknown
i would like to send them a new year 's greeting
i would like them to dwell on a single new year 's prayer
lord please let my soul come to maturity before it is UNknown
why are we here ?
surely no one here is going to die !
no i can 't go on
i can 't go on !
i 'm sorry but i must go away and i cannot leave them behind
please don 't be angry with me
it 's not my fault
this will do david
yes david i see what 's coming
i 'm UNknown to watch
i do not UNknown my duty
you mustn 't let it happen !
thls mustn 't come to pass !
don 't let those poor innocent creatures die !
i have no power over the living
where shall i turn ?
should i pray to god or to jesus ?
who can tell me where to direct my plea ?
i 'm a poor miserable sinner
i beseech thee lord of life and death !
i 'm not worthy
sentence me to eternal night !
let nothing remain of me !
do what you like to me my lord only spare the three of them !
david i see that i no longer need to grieve for you !
she hasn 't done it yet
i made it here in UNknown !
sister UNknown is dead and i have been at her side
i promised her to become a good husband and father
you 'r e lying !
sister maria told me you refused to go to her
are you crying david ?
no one believes i want to reform
i want to be good but no one believes me ls it any wonder i cry ?
it 's hard to believe david
but i do believe you
your tears convinced me
i won 't be truly happy until my sorrow is drained
lord please let my soul come to maturity before it ls UNknown

i will gladly heed your summons but grant me a day 's grace for there is someone
i must talk sense into
you do not know what terrible misfortune i have caused
i cannot approach the lord before i have put it right
i must tell you that the person i 'm UNknown for is the man i love
do you understand ?
i would grant you grace if it would avail you but you have no power over this man
you have tried to make him mend his ways believing he was good but your hopes have been dashed time and time again
you 'r e the one who UNknown him away from his home and his work !
you made him the drunkard he is !
don 't let yourself be dragged under !
salvation army rally
what 's the use of making such a fuss ?
i 'm a UNknown but i cough into people 's faces in the hope of UNknown them off
why should they be better than us ?
he 's merely amusing UNknown
he 's not as wicked as he pretends to be
how can you be filled with such bitter hatred for your fellow man ?
you needn 't worry about that
i UNknown l be UNknown town in a few days
no you mustn 't do that !
i would rather you stayed so i may challenge you again
however tempting that maybe i still can 't stay
you see little missy i 'm on a journey throughout sweden in search of a person i must find at all costs
who ls this person you seek ?
you UNknown l know that when i find the person in question
i am the one david holm is looking for
i am his wife
i deserted him took my children and crept away in secret
i moved to this town for it was so far from our old home that i never expected him to come looking for me here
you must take him back !
it 's his only hope !
i didn 't mean that you must make up your mind on the spot but promise me to listen to your heart and we can talk again
she had got the better of herself and asked for none of the UNknown that belonged to this world
just come with me !
a surprise awaits that will make you happy
end of part UNknown
she wanted to UNknown the seed that had fallen among the thorns and she may well have gained her end had it not been that
the doctor says it 's pneumonia
her resistance is so poor for she has had ill health ever since last new year 's eve
yes this david holm has been her UNknown
she worries so about the situation between him and his wife but she mustn 't know the truth
you might at least have the heart to spare the children from infection !
it wasn 't as easy to run away this time !
haven 't you had enough revenge ?
lf only i hadn 't brought them together again !
his sin would be of less magnitude if not for me
you must grant me grace !
i cannot die yet !
i must see him turn over a new leaf !
just spare me a few minutes !
you know i love him
i UNknown e never loved him as i do today
captive ye of loving heart take leave of thy prison
those who are to receive her will arrive shortly
you know david if i could send a message to UNknown
i would like to send them a new year 's greeting
i would like them to dwell on a single new year 's prayer
lord please let my soul come to maturity before it is UNknown
why are we here ?
surely no one here is going to die !
no i can 't go on
i can 't go on !
i 'm sorry but i must go away and i cannot leave them behind
please don 't be angry with me
it 's not my fault
this will do david
yes david i see what 's coming
i 'm UNknown to watch
i do not UNknown my duty
you mustn 't let it happen !
thls mustn 't come to pass !
don 't let those poor innocent creatures die !
i have no power over the living
where shall i turn ?
should i pray to god or to jesus ?
who can tell me where to direct my plea ?
i 'm a poor miserable sinner
i beseech thee lord of life and death !
i 'm not worthy
sentence me to eternal night !
let nothing remain of me !
do what you like to me my lord only spare the three of them !
david i see that i no longer need to grieve for you !
she hasn 't done it yet
i made it here in UNknown !
sister UNknown is dead and i have been at her side
i promised her to become a good husband and father
you 'r e lying !
sister maria told me you refused to go to her
are you crying david ?
no one believes i want to reform
i want to be good but no one believes me ls it any wonder i cry ?
it 's hard to believe david
but i do believe you
your tears convinced me
i won 't be truly happy until my sorrow is drained
lord please let my soul come to maturity before it ls UNknown
mastered at UNknown k ln
the phantom carriage
at the camera
she was stricken with UNknown UNknown and she had only held out for the space of a year
when there was no hope left she had gone home to her mother
waiting at the foot of her bed was another salvation army sister who had once worked alongside the sick girl
don 't fret over those poor souls now sister UNknown
you have done enough for them
send for david holm !
please don 't !
let me have her to myself now that she ls UNknown
UNknown maria why don 't you do as i ask ?
send for david holm !
i shall go fetch UNknown at once
you can 't be serious UNknown david holm to attend a death bed ?
i haven 't been able to find him but UNknown is looking too
he will bring him here if that is at all possible
poor mrs holm poor mrs holm
i UNknown l take her back home
it wouldn 't do for her husband to see her should he come
the UNknown on which these events took place was not an ordinary one
it was new year 's eve
well we will certainly know when it 's time to toast the new year !
it 's a spooky place to await midnight here among the dead
you gentlemen are not afraid of ghosts i hope ?
then i 'd like to tell you a story while we wait for the midnight hour
i once had a pal called georges who was generally a jolly fellow
he came of a good family and had studied hard at UNknown university so he knew a bit more than the rest of us
but a change would come over UNknown on new year 's eve
remember that it 's new year 's eve the last day of the year !
whoever dies on this eve must drive the cart of death
there is an old old cart
no ordinary driver holds the reigns
he is in the service of a strict master named death
for him a single night is as long as 100 years on earth
night and day he must carry out his master 's business
end of part i
wherever he goes he is greeted with sorrow and despair
there is no escape he must perform his sorry duty
although the horse and cart remain the same the driver will vary
the last soul to die each year the one who gives up the ghost at the stroke of midnight is destined to be death 's driver during the coming year
now you know why i 'm afraid of something fatal happening on new year 's eve
and the odd thing is you see that georges apparently died last new year 's eve
why hasn 't UNknown arrived with david holm ?
come with me david holm
sister UNknown is dying and she has asked for you
lf sister UNknown wants to see you you must go at once !
david i can 't believe it 's you !
you are meant to relieve me !
you ought to lift me up ln your cart and take me to the hospital
no living soul rides ln this cart
by the time i arrive it is too late for a doctor
you know well enough that i am no longer alive
but worst of all you must face the consequences of the evil you have wrought during your lifetime
david do you think i 'm unaware that it is my fault you have met such an end ?
lf you hadn 't fallen in with me you would have led a good life with your wife children and brother
by tomorrow you will have served your time for drunken behaviour
but before you leave a UNknown punishment awaits you
behold your brother
but we feel that you ought to serve the sentence instead since you and you alone led him astray and made him a killer
does this not make you turn from your wicked ways david holm ?
yes for only now do i realise how it feels to have brought great misery upon a loved one
what about your wife and children ?
i know how miserable they felt but i will turn over a new leaf
end of part ll
no she is not ill
she was well enough the other day when she left
and here i was UNknown i would come home to her with such joy !
lf she had gone openly
i would have understood but to UNknown off like that to let me come home to an empty house that was heartless !
i UNknown l wipe those smiles off your faces
i UNknown l find her and i UNknown l teach her how it feels when your heart freezes to its very core like mine has !
i UNknown l refrain from reminding you of your search for your wife during which your feelings of hatred and revenge UNknown stronger
i will take you to a time a year ago to last new year 's eve when you came here bringing such misfortune in your wake
a salvation army station had been set up here in town
and it was ready for use on new year 's eve
keep your food !
leave it be !
we don 't have the UNknown oven going yet
don 't you realise maria how it pleases me to help the first guest god sent us ?
please go to bed
let me attend to thls
dear jesus let our first guest be blessed with a happy year
all UNknown long she bent over the coat never giving thought to the germs she had UNknown
by the time she went to bed the chill of winter had thoroughly penetrated the room
did you mend my coat ?
would you mind UNknown the person who did this ?
it 's a shame you went to all that trouble miss but i 'm used to having it like this
before you leave i 'd like to ask you to visit me next new year 's eve
you see i prayed that our first guest would have a good year
and i wanted to find out if my prayers were answered
oh i UNknown l be here
i UNknown l come to show you god didn 't give a fig for you or your UNknown
the time has come to honour that promise before you take over here
from you she contracted the disease that ends her life and now she awaits your visit
you have possessed all that is most wonderful but you have lost it !
you cannot UNknown the torment or remorse just as you cannot escape taking over as death 's driver for a year
captive take leave of thy prison !
ye spirit that left thy body at the stroke of midnight thou wilt relieve me of my office
for a year thou wilt reap souls
end of part ill
it is death but too soon
you see that i 'm not afraid of you
i will gladly heed your summons but grant me a day 's grace for there is someone

i would UNknown once more that i am expecting this very night the widow of your brother as my guest !
so you are staying !
but you will take the responsibility

father UNknown from rom !
father UNknown from rom ? !
yes i almost had forgotten it in all this excitement !
i must go at once and get you his letter
father UNknown ? !
she will stay !
i only go hunting in rain and storm !
tell me why is your husband always so quit ?
his reverence father UNknown has just announced his arrival for tonight
and this strange UNknown really goes hunting in this beastly weather !
he should know why he is UNknown the arrival of his relative the father !
this very night i will yet have many things to discuss with the father !
now our house is being blessed
speak to me dear child speak to me !
how strange your reverence this encounter
for all these years i have fought with the idea
to speak my mind to you your reverence the only men
the friend and relative of my late husband
it has been four years now
our marriage was first like just one day of happiness
one day he departed
i am longing for seeing evil wanting evil
i cannot go on not now tomorrow
will you please excuse me for today
i will pay my reverence tomorrow to the owners of the castle
please ask his reverence to come to see me !
it 's getting uncomfortable here UNknown all !
no more of this now !
tomorrow i shall travel !
i have informed the authorities because my suspicion of this count UNknown !
ladies and gentlemen !
i have been dreaming last night !
count UNknown !
believe me my investigating eye is experienced !
and yet count UNknown is involved in the father 's disappearance
he is acting so superior in order to conceal his new crime
he will have to apologize for his UNknown jokes in the presence of all guests !
you absolutely have to talk to him
you already know everything sir !
UNknown you also know who is being suspected here of the father 's disappearance ?
i also know how to read secrets
to give you an example i am now going to give away to our baron one of his secrets
count UNknown !
my compliments for your opinion !
i just want to whisper a few words into baron UNknown UNknown 's ears
do you perhaps want all of a sudden to accuse the baron of the assassination of your brother ?
today i am going to disclose it
he has assassinated my husband !
in a fight he shot my brother to death !
what do you know of that time my dear speak !
UNknown the count UNknown to run away !
and so i am telling you he has the father also on his conscience
father UNknown is back again !
yesterday i was seeking comfort and you did not come !
today i am going to confess you !
because you as a priest you have to keep silence !
we must not do anything now !
the events of these last days will now probably clear up !
a few days before the assassination of my husband
after half an hour
an assassination !
he shot my husband to death !
then i also realized my UNknown !
the count was arrested !
had he been convicted
thus accursed both of us !
tied together by our UNknown !
we got married !
so we were two companions !
and today i rescued him !
i accused count UNknown of UNknown !
thus far my destiny has driven me
now you know everything !
and you have to remain silent !
i understand you !
i who UNknown outlawed had always guessed
so any way had to be right for me in order to finally clear myself from this UNknown suspicion !
therefore i arrived before father UNknown who was expected in the castle !
we have to beg your pardon for so many things !
the missing UNknown were UNknown using the script and a list of titles UNknown UNknown filed on 31 march 1921
the new UNknown used the original UNknown
and bear the UNknown UNknown
the work was done in collaboration with the federal archive film archive berlin UNknown and UNknown wilhelm UNknown UNknown
the reconstruction was done in collaboration with the berlin federal film UNknown archives and UNknown wilhelm UNknown UNknown UNknown
adapted by carl mayer
it has been raining all through the hunting days of october
the lord of the castle
the retired county court judge
rumor has it that he UNknown killed his own brother three years ago !
he thus became the only owner of all the inheritance
the frightened gentleman
i would remind you once more that i am expecting this very night the widow of your brother as my guest !
the widow of the victim ?
the widow of the victim
she married baron UNknown UNknown a year ago
i would like to spare all of us the situation of the baroness 's meeting you here my lord !
so you are staying !
but you will take all responsibility for what happens
waiting for the baroness
so you pretend to have learned the art of prophecy in india ?
will you then tell us whether considering that this is a hunting party
whether one shot will be fired !
there will be one shot !
no you cannot leave !
do you know who else will come here to see you ?
father UNknown from rome !
father UNknown from rome ?
yes i almost had forgotten it in all this excitement !
i must go at once and get his letter
i UNknown l bring the letter to you soon
father UNknown ?
she will stay !
it fills me with great joy to know that the wife of my late relative will be invited into your home
blessed are the circumstances that bring me back to the north after being so long in rome
i shall arrive in the coming days at UNknown vogel to meet with all of you in person my dear friends
end of the first act
the sun !
i only go hunting in rain and storm !
tell me why is your husband always so quiet ?
but alas only fifteen minutes later
look the adventurous count UNknown is actually going hunting in such beastly weather
he should know why he is UNknown the arrival of his relative the father !
i have many things to talk about tonight with the father !
now our house is truly blessed
the baroness will see his reverence now
tell me dear child tell me !
how strange your reverence this meeting
for all these years i have fought with the idea
to speak my mind to you your reverence the only man who was a friend and relative of my late husband
it has been four years now
end of the second act
like just one continuous day of happiness
so we lived for months in blinding happiness
one day he went away
he returned a few weeks later and
he was someone else
believe me dear child true happiness lies only in the UNknown of everything worldly
he wanted a saint
so for months
i was craving to do something evil wanting something evil
that 's when i met baron UNknown UNknown
my husband was shot dead
i cannot continue not now maybe tomorrow
will you please excuse me for today
i will pay my respects tomorrow to the owners of the castle
a conversation about hunting
a quarter of an hour later
no nobody left through here !
we looked all over the castle !
this is becoming very sinister !
an hour later
a crime ?
but the assistant in the kitchen dreams of what happened in the last few hours
end of the third act
so try to understand !
suddenly there are important affairs to be attended to !
they don 't feel quite at ease any more in my house
i have informed the authorities of my suspicions about this count UNknown !
a happy man
what did you say that ?
last night i had a dream !
count UNknown !
believe me my investigating eye is experienced !
and yet count UNknown is involved in the father 's disappearance
he is acting so superior in order to conceal his new crime
he will have to apologize for his UNknown joke in the presence of all the guests !
you absolutely have to speak to him
you already know everything sir !
perhaps you also know who is suspected of causing the father 's disappearance ?
causing the father 's disappearance ?
i also know how to discover secrets
to give you an example i am now going to give away one of the baron 's secrets
count UNknown !
to disclose them in front of everybody
my compliments for your opinion !
i just want to whisper a few words into baron UNknown UNknown 's ears
what are these suggestions ?
do you perhaps suddenly accuse the baron of the assassination of your brother ?
today i UNknown l find out !
he murdered my husband !
he shot his own brother during an argument !
end of the fourth act
my lord the count preferred to run away !
and so i tell you he has the disappearance of the father also on his conscience
father UNknown has returned again !
yesterday i was seeking comfort and you did not come !
today i will make my confession to you !
because you as a priest must keep silent !
we must not do anything now !
the events of these last days will now probably clear up !
a few days before the murder of my husband
i am appalled at such holiness !
i 'd like to see something evil something very very evil !
a murder !
he killed my husband !
he confessed to me two days later
then i realized i was guilty
the count was arrested
we would have been poisoned to prove his innocence
but he was not convicted !
thus accursed both of us !
fearing life !
we got married !
so we became two comrades !
and today i have saved him !!
i UNknown count UNknown in the murder of his own brother !
i have followed my destiny so far !
now you know everything !
and you must remain silent !
i was not happy
i who was UNknown accused had always guessed
so some way had to be found for me finally to clear myself from this UNknown suspicion !
so i arrived before father UNknown who was also expected at the castle !
thus i came to the castle to await father UNknown !
we have to beg your pardon for so many things !

my main sources are mentioned in the theatre 's UNknown
let us look into the history of UNknown and try to explain the mysterious chapter known as the witch
the belief in sorcery and witchcraft is probably as old as mankind
when primitive man is confronted with something incomprehensible the explanation is always sorcery and evil spirits
in persia the imaginary creatures UNknown in the following picture were thus believed to be the cause of diseases
the english scientist UNknown and french scientist UNknown show us pictures of evil spirits believed to have UNknown amongst the first UNknown
the belief in evil spirits sorcery and witchcraft is the result of naive notions about the mystery of the universe
here we see how the egyptians UNknown the shape of the world according to UNknown
the ancient egyptians believed that high mountains surrounded land and water on all sides
the sky was made of steel and supported by strong pillars that stood on the high mountains
the stars like lamps hung from the sky on ropes
according to the beliefs of other ancient UNknown the sky was UNknown and the earth shaped into terraces
the evil spirits of ancient times changed in the medieval UNknown to devils sneaking around and tempting children
the devils lived in the earth 's core
in the latter part of the middle ages the earth was considered to be a stationary sphere in the middle of the universe
above the earth and its waters
the medieval man first imagined a layer of air
then a layer of fire
and outside the fire were the planets moving celestial bodies
each planet was attached to its transparent UNknown sphere
and outside the planetary UNknown were the fixed stars arranged in a sky of their own
above it all in the tenth crystal sphere sits the almighty surrounded by nine UNknown of angels
and he is the one keeping the UNknown revolving
deep down in the earth 's core lies hell where those tempted by the devil shall suffer forever
in the upper part of the following picture from the french historian UNknown
the devils are stuffing the damned into large pots
a sinner is thrown straight into the fire burning under one of the UNknown
a devil pours the nasty sulfur UNknown from a horn down a man 's throat
two monsters torment some of the damned with their sharp teeth
i have found a strange old mechanical presentation of hell which offers a good understanding of the beliefs in the middle ages
observe the eagerness with which the devils tend to the fire under the UNknown !
during the middle ages devils and hell were considered real and constantly feared
witches were thought to have signed an unlawful pact with the devil and therefore they were burned at the stake
the floating figure is a devil coming to get the witch by lifting her up into the air
this picture of a pyre as well as the following one are from german life in the past in pictures
in this image a witch is milking an ax handle
in the following image a witch has bewitched a man 's shoe
witches usually meet in UNknown
and after the gathering they might for instance sneak into a barn and UNknown a cow
the small UNknown symbol noticeable under the drawing was usually carved into the barn door as protection against witches
in this old naive drawing a sorcerer and a witch are casting spells setting a village on fire
witches were believed to curse people with diseases with the help of sorcerer 's powder and magic UNknown
notice how the sick person is laying naked in bed
that was UNknown in the past
it was a general belief that the witch was naked when at night during the so called witch sabbath she danced with the devils
women who wanted to participate in the sabbath sneaked away to the sorcerer
where they could have their backs smeared with witch ointment
the witchcraft of the ointment would allow them to fly through the air
the french doctors UNknown and UNknown gave me the following pictures of the witch sabbath a secret UNknown rite to which thousands of women UNknown their participation
at the sabbath witches and UNknown first UNknown the church 's holy cross
satan gives all the UNknown devils names
and a ceremonial banquet is held
the sabbath food was often prepared from corpses from the gallows
all witches had to show the devil their respect by kissing his behind
after a merry dance with the devils the witches fly home at the first crow of the cock
these scenes are often found on famous witch sabbath pictures from the middle ages and the renaissance
to be continued
tonight the stars shine UNknown over the gallows hill
ugh what a stench !
the thief 's body has been hanging too long on the gallows
when such a thief 's finger is too dried out it can no longer lend the brew any healing power
hurry and open up UNknown so that the UNknown by won 't see me
UNknown can you perchance get me a love potion that has power over a pious man of the church ?
here young maiden take a potion of cat UNknown and dove hearts boiled in the moonlight
a drop of this in a man 's drink will soften his heart at once
UNknown can i have an even stronger potion ?
if the maiden wishes to drive the man out of his wits for love
i have a potion boiled in may from a young and playful male sparrow
hold your coin maiden !
first smell my ointment !
this salve is good should you wish to travel to UNknown one night
secretly smear this salve on and the pious monk might directly come to your chamber
you will fly together high up in the night and he will bestow upon you many hungry kisses
listen brother i wonder shouldn 't we pray before we embark in such a bold enterprise ?
oh holy mother forgive us for cutting open a person 's dead body with a knife !
it is not from untimely curiosity that we so badly sin
but so that the cause of many terrible diseases might be revealed to us
such were the middle ages when witchcraft and the devil 's work were sought everywhere
and that is why unusual things were believed to be true
damned woman !
you watch out !
so it happens with witchcraft as with the devil ; people 's belief in him was so strong that he became real
the devil is everywhere and takes all shapes
he shows himself as a nightmare a raging demon a UNknown a lover and a knight
the devils companion can be young and beautiful but she is more often old poor and miserable
is it from the eternal fright of the pyre that you get drunk every night you poor old woman of the middle ages ?
when the evening bell tolls in the night and all fires in town are covered with ashes the devil UNknown UNknown for his adventures
high up in the air is UNknown 's dream castle and there the devil will fulfill all her secret wishes
to be continued
a woman suspected of witchcraft is thrown into the water to find out whether she is guilty or not
in history of customs edward UNknown shows us how the accused is tied up
two UNknown use oars to move the accused in the water where she has no support
if she floats she will be pulled up and burned
if she sinks the judges thank god for her innocence
i will now UNknown a trial for witchcraft from beginning to end taking place at the time when the pope sent traveling inquisition priests out to germany
oh my husband could not have been struck by dizziness so suddenly unless a sorceress had bewitched him !
be comforted anna wife of the printer the power of lead will soon reveal it
oh you powerful UNknown allow this lead to show if UNknown the printer is bewitched
it is written here in the shape of lead that his dizziness is atrocious witchcraft
oh peter look where is the evil sorceress ?
you might see that witch before you wish to
before i wish to
i did not hear you come maria the weaver !
oh maiden please have mercy on me a poor woman who has to go begging from door to door !
are you hungry maria ?
if so sit down
watch out little sister watch out
that woman has evil eyes
the youngest servant of the inquisition may not exchange words with a strange maiden
how wonderful !
young maiden you know quite well that what you 'r e accusing this woman of UNknown her life ?
swear by the cross that you are not deadly enemies !
let 's go young men before her feet are lifted so that the evil witch won 't turn us all into mice
now you can have a UNknown death just what you deserve you damned mistress of the devil !
to be continued
maria the weaver was just taken here accused of witchcraft
master look carefully there might be witch powder hidden in the sorceress hair
the suspect 's nights are now dictated by the inquisition judges
two honorable men try UNknown to persuade her to confess
if she UNknown denies her charges they will use a kind of mental torture
woman see here the seven holy words of jesus crucified written on consecrated UNknown
i will hang them around her neck so that the devil will no longer help her to be silent
does she see this length of consecrated wax as corpus UNknown ?
the accused is taken backwards into the torture chamber so as not to UNknown the judge when entering
for the last time i ask
does she want to confess her witchcraft and her UNknown ?
let her suffering begin so that we might put an end to the UNknown of her heart
oh you learned men !
how do you expect me to confess to that which is not true ?
well UNknown the executioner !
let now the evil witch 's body sting
let her catch her breath UNknown the executioner and loosen the screw a little at a time as she confesses her sins
oh learned men !
and when i gave birth UNknown and all her UNknown helped me
if i am spared the pain i will confess that trina has smeared me with witch ointment
oh yes learned men miserable me has flown through the night air to UNknown on trina 's broom
and the devil 's grandmother was there with all her witchcraft
and many a woman who had not accomplished enough evil deeds was treated miserably by the devil
and masses spat upon all that is holy
and a meal of UNknown and UNknown children was cooked by UNknown
listen maria the weaver did you also see how the devil put his mark on the witches UNknown ?
oh learned men i saw the witches kiss the evil one on his behind
and anna 's mother the wife of the printer who wished me a UNknown death
that damned woman i saw her kissing the evil one so tenderly and UNknown her servant that old fool was also there
and elsa who kicked me some time ago she shall also burn at the stake
she passed martin the writer 's door one moonlit night with her sister
and they cast a spell on martin the writer with the water they threw against his door
and it was the very same night that death took martin the writer
and now i will tell you everything about the witches who yell after me in the street where i live
to be continued
each witch gives ten others away
the town wardens busy themselves
if you oppose the capture of a witch you must be a witch yourself
the destiny of young anna wife of the printer is sealed
so now only two people are left in UNknown the printer 's haunted house
during the witchcraft era it was dangerous to be old and ugly but it was not safe to be young and pretty either
brother help me
i UNknown l whip your sinful body and your poor soul into faith healing
oh brother why did you stop the beating of the scourge ?
now my soul will surely be damned
father henrik brother john is UNknown
a witch appears in his cell to tempt him
and she has grabbed him by the wrist
stand up brother father henrik is coming
brother you have not given the maiden away for a witch have you ?
you know the punishment for those who refuse to witness against a witch ?
and so they fetch you too young maiden giving you their UNknown test
in the name of the holy trinity if you are not a witch you will now shed tears !
see for yourself you cannot shed tears as you are allied with the evil one
we assume now that the young woman UNknown ; that no threat and no pain can persuade her to confess
i have tried to find out how the excellent inquisition judges behaved in such circumstances
and i see in front of me some scenes which i do not find pictured too UNknown here on the white screen
wake up young maiden !
i bring you great happiness
see young maiden i give you your freedom
if you would just show me a small favor in return
why do you taunt me monk ?
what favor can a poor creature like me show you ?
teach me the beautiful art of making thunder with this water !
if you do not want to take my word young maiden stand up and look out at the jail court
did the guards leave ?
yes they went far away maiden
the keys are now in my hand and i can secretly take you out through the town gates tonight
and i swear eternal silence to you maiden about all you will reveal about witchcraft with thunder
do you remember maiden that UNknown the printer 's child is all alone in the world without relatives besides you ?
oh father henrik see the tears of the young maiden
look she cries hence she cannot be a sorceress
silly boy !
here maiden see the child who will miserably perish as a dishonorable rejected witch 's offspring without you
stand here and listen to all the maiden 's words so that later you may bear witness against her
and will you secretly open the jail gates for the child and me if i speak ?
then i will tell you that once a traveling stone cutter told me
that when witches call for thunder they put their hands in the water
you hardened witch !
and then they will burn you too maiden
as UNknown for man as sweet scent for god
and one pyre after another burns in the town square until the judges will one day move on to the next town
the witch madness like a spiritual plague UNknown wherever these judges go
in the arc of a few centuries over 8 million women men and children were burned as witches
to be continued
many women for instance confess that transformed into cats they soiled the altar during the night while two devils in the shape of animals stood guard at the church door
but there are also confessions which might very well be close to the truth namely during the times when superstition ruled
many women were burned because they confessed that they bewitched a marriage bed by tying knots !
for each knot a pregnancy is destroyed
and the happiness of a whole house could be ruined with witch hair and metal crosses
many women have probably really used such magic tricks and believed in their destructive effects
but if we should judge from the confessions we must take a closer look at the props in the torture chamber
you and i would also be driven to confess mysterious talents with the help of such tools
isn 't that so ?
the french doctor paul UNknown describes the way this collar was used
the collar was UNknown with the help of four UNknown ropes
the wrists and ankles of the accused were tied to two iron rods screwed to the floor
when a fire bowl was put under the poor victim
his movements were so violent that the spikes of the collar entered his neck
doctor UNknown shows another picture which speaks for itself
it is simply called after the interrogation
the painful interrogation preferably began with a lighter torture
the UNknown for example
i will not reveal the terrible confessions i forced from the young lady in less than a minute
in the UNknown during the middle ages fear of the devil UNknown into an almost hopeless despair
the pious gave themselves up to many a regrettable self punishment
often a single nun was seized and suddenly thereafter the whole convent was UNknown by insanity
a mysterious contagious insanity
get thee behind me satan !
may all good saints stand by me !
sister cecilia is conniving with the evil one
how these religious women must have suffered before their nerves abandoned them and insanity broke out ?
in their UNknown this desperate cry is always found
the devil forced us into it !
oh holy mother the evil has a terrible power !
look now he forces me into doing what i want the least
burn me at the stake pious fathers !
can 't you see what the devil forces me to do ?
take me !
the evil one stands over there and threatens me
to be continued
and come to present times
the majority of witches in the old days were poor women ; those who are taken in by pious organizations and nursing homes nowadays
one or more traits that might make an old woman noticeable was enough to bring her to court during the witchcraft era
let us not believe that the devil belongs solely to the past
the lovely old woman who plays the role of maria the weaver in my film once raised her tired face to me during a pause in the shoot
with the old woman 's permission i show here the prayer book in which a woman from 1921 !
thinks she can tell the devil by sight
the witch 's insanity can be explained as a nervous exhaustion that i will try to UNknown here
i ask my viewer to understand that in the following i let the same actress
UNknown many different patients of related nervous disorders
i have personally known a very nervous young woman who often walked in her sleep
why did she always UNknown the very same thing she was most afraid she would do ?
like a witch forced by the devil this woman
both when sleeping and awake gives way to a mysterious craving to strike matches
had this possession anything to do with her morbid fear of fire after one broke out in her home ?
she stated that she felt as if she were fighting against an unknown force stronger than her own
isn 't there something witch like with this sleepwalker who moves through the UNknown household with her matches ?
doesn 't she remind us of the nun who walks through the chapel with her knife forced by the devil ?
this poor woman also in a bewildered condition does during her sleep just what she fears the most
these possessions these UNknown dazed conditions are consistent with the nervous diseases we call hysteria
and there are still more connections between the medieval witch and the modern hysterical person
we remember for instance that the witch received nightly UNknown by the devil
today it is not the devil but rather a famous actor a popular clergyman or a well known doctor who disturbs the calm of the night
the hysterical person will undoubtedly say that these celebrities come to her through the wall or window
notice how consciously this unconscious woman holds onto her bed
a person afflicted by hysteria always UNknown some artificial UNknown
in the middle ages it was believed that during the sabbath the devil put some invisible marks on the witch 's body where all sensitivity vanished
the executioner often found insensitive areas on the back of the accused
i see clearly that you are a witch
you do not even feel the master 's instrument on your back
today this strange UNknown is considered a symptom of hysteria
no sir i do not feel you touching my back at all
yes it is as i thought ; your daughter is suffering from hysteria
from what you told me i must strongly recommend that we detain your daughter for the time being in my clinic
it would be a pity if your daughter were to have an unpleasant exchange with the police
poor little hysterical witch !
in the middle ages you were in conflict with the church
now it is with the law
i ask you to step into my office
or do you prefer that i call the police ?
your name ?
your address ?
thank you that 's fine
you can leave
if my family learns about this i will be UNknown detained
i beg you to understand that i am an unhappy sick person
i do not know what i am doing
i have not been able to live with this persistent fear during the war
i am a broken person
it is as if an unknown power UNknown me to commit this terrible theft
look here !
what shall i do with it ?
i do not know a word of russian
my husband died in the war and i have not been the same since
i promise not to pursue this matter but i have to ask you never to visit my store again
centuries have passed and the almighty of medieval times no longer sits in his tenth sphere
we no longer sit in church staring terrified at the UNknown of the devils
the witch no longer flies away on her broom over the rooftops
but isn 't superstition still UNknown among us ?
is there an obvious difference between the sorceress and her customer then and now ?
we no longer burn our old and poor
but do they not often suffer bitterly ?
and the little woman whom we call hysterical alone and unhappy isn 't she still a riddle for us ?
nowadays we detain the unhappy in a mental institution or
if she is wealthy in a modern clinic
and then we will console ourselves with the notion that the mildly UNknown shower of the clinic has replaced the barbaric methods of medieval times
the wltch 1 922 ab UNknown UNknown
a presentation from a UNknown and UNknown point of view in 7 chapters of moving pictures
UNknown UNknown wrote the script and produced this film between the years of 1 91 9 and 1 921

many women for instance confess that transformed into cats they soiled the altar during the night while two devils in the shape of animals stood guard at the church door
but there are also confessions which might very weii be close to the truth namely during the times when superstition ruled
many women were burned because they confessed that they bewitched a marriage bed by tying knots !
for each knot a pregnancy is destroyed
and the happiness of a whole house could be ruined with witch hair and UNknown crosses
many women have probably reaily used such magic tricks and believed in their destructive effects
but if we should judge from the confessions we must take a closer iook at the props in the torture chamber
you and i would also be driven to confess mysterious talents with the help of such tools
isn 't that so ?
the french doctor UNknown UNknown describes the way this UNknown was used
the UNknown was UNknown with the help of four UNknown ropes
the wrists and ankles of the accused were tied to two iron rods screwed to the floor
when a fire UNknown was put under the poor victim
his movements were so violent that the spikes of the UNknown entered his neck
doctor UNknown shows another picture which speaks for itself
it is simply cailed after the interrogation
the UNknown interrogation preferably began with a iighter torture the UNknown for example
one of my actresses insisted on trying the UNknown when we shot these pictures
i wiii not UNknown the terrible confessions i forced from the young iady in iess than a minute
in the UNknown during the middle ages fear of the devii UNknown into an almost hopeless despair
the pious gave themselves up to many a regrettable self punishment
often a single nun was seized and suddenly thereafter the whole convent was UNknown by insanity
a mysterious contagious insanity
get thee behind me satan !
may aii good saints stand by me !
sister cecilia is conniving with the evii one
how these religious women must have suffered before their nerves abandoned them and insanity broke out ?
in their UNknown this desperate cry is always found
the devii forced us into it !
oh holy mother the evii has a terrible power !
look now he forces me into doing what i want the ieast
burn me at the stake pious fathers !
can 't you see what the devii forces me to do ?
take me !
the evii one stands over there and threatens me
to be continued
the majority of witches in the old days were poor women ; those who are taken in by pious organizations and nursing homes nowadays
one or more traits that might make an old woman noticeable was enough to bring her to court during the witchcraft era
let us not believe that the devii belongs UNknown to the past
the iovely old woman who plays the role of maria the weaver in my film once raised her tired face to me during a pause in the shoot
with the old woman 's permission i show here the prayer book in which a woman from 1 921 ! thinks she can teii the devii by sight
the witch 's insanity can be explained as a nervous exhaustion that i wiii try to UNknown here
i ask my viewer to understand that in the foilowing i iet the same actress
UNknown many different patients of related nervous disorders
i have UNknown known a very nervous young woman who often walked in her sleep
why did she always UNknown the very same thing she was most afraid she would do ?
like a witch forced by the devil this woman
both when sleeping and awake gives way to a mysterious craving to strike matches
had this possession anything to do with her morbid fear of fire after one broke out in her home ?
she stated that she felt as if she were fighting against an unknown force stronger than her own
isn 't there something witch iike with this sleepwalker who moves through the UNknown household with her matches ?
doesn 't she remind us of the nun who walks through the UNknown with her knife forced by the devil ?
this poor woman also in a bewildered condition does during her sleep just what she fears the most
these possessions these UNknown dazed conditions are consistent with the nervous diseases we caii hysteria
and there are stiii more connections between the UNknown witch and the modern UNknown person
we remember for instance that the witch received nightly UNknown by the devil
today it is not the devil but rather a famous actor a popular clergyman or a weil known doctor who disturbs the calm of the night
the UNknown person wiii undoubtedly say that these celebrities come to her through the UNknown or window
notice how consciously this unconscious woman holds onto her bed
a person afflicted by hysteria always UNknown some UNknown UNknown
in the middle ages it was believed that during the sabbath the devii put some invisible marks on the witch 's body where aii sensitivity vanished
the executioner often found insensitive areas on the back of the accused
i see clearly that you are a witch
you do not even feei the master 's instrument on your back
today this strange UNknown is considered a symptom of hysteria
no sir i do not feei you touching my back at ail
yes it is as i thought ; your daughter is suffering from hysteria
from what you told me i must strongly recommend that we detain your daughter for the time being in my clinic
it would be a pity if your daughter were to have an unpleasant exchange with the police
poor iittle UNknown witch !
in the middle ages you were in conflict with the church
now it is with the iaw
i ask you to step into my office
or do you prefer that i caii the police ?
your name ?
your address ?
thank you that 's fine
you can ieave
if my family UNknown about this i wiii be UNknown detained
i beg you to understand that i am an unhappy sick person
i do not know what i am doing
i have not been able to iive with this persistent fear during the war
i am a broken person
it is as if an unknown power UNknown me to commit this terrible theft
look here !
what shaii i do with it ?
i do not know a word of russian
my husband died in the war and i have not been the same since
i promise not to pursue this matter but i have to ask you never to visit my store again
centuries have passed and the almighty of UNknown times no ionger sits in his tenth sphere
we no ionger sit in church staring terrified at the UNknown of the devils
the witch no ionger flies away on her broom over the rooftops
but isn 't superstition stiii UNknown among us ?
is there an obvious difference between the sorceress and her customer then and now ?
we no ionger burn our old and poor
but do they not often suffer bitterly ?
and the iittle woman whom we caii hysterical alone and unhappy isn 't she stiii a riddle for us ?
nowadays we detain the unhappy in a UNknown institution or
if she is wealthy in a modern clinic
and then we wiii console ourselves with the notion that the UNknown UNknown shower of the clinic has replaced the barbaric methods of UNknown times
a presentation from a cultural and historical point of view in 7 chapters of moving pictures
UNknown UNknown wrote the script and produced this film between the years of 1919 and 1921
for the photography i am grateful to mr johan UNknown and to mr richard UNknown for the art direction
my main sources are mentioned in the theatre 's UNknown
let us look into the history of UNknown and try to explain the mysterious chapter known as the witch
the belief in sorcery and witchcraft is probably as old as mankind
when primitive man is confronted with something incomprehensible the explanation is always sorcery and evil spirits
in persia the imaginary creatures UNknown in the following picture were thus believed to be the cause of diseases
the english scientist UNknown and french scientist UNknown show us pictures of evil spirits believed to have UNknown amongst the first UNknown
the belief in evil spirits sorcery and witchcraft is the result of na ve notions about the mystery of the universe
here we see how the egyptians UNknown the shape of the world according to UNknown
the ancient egyptians believed that high mountains surrounded land and water on all sides
the sky was made of steel and supported by strong pillars that stood on the high mountains
the stars like lamps hung from the sky on ropes
according to the beliefs of other ancient UNknown the sky was UNknown and the earth shaped into terraces
the evil spirits of ancient times changed in the medieval UNknown to devils sneaking around and tempting children
the devils lived in the earth 's core
in the latter part of the middle ages the earth was considered to be a stationary sphere in the middle of the universe
above the earth and its waters
the medieval man first imagined a layer of air
then a layer of fire
and outside the fire were the planets moving celestial bodies
each planet was attached to its transparent UNknown sphere
and outside the planetary UNknown were the fixed stars arranged in a sky of their own
above it all in the tenth crystal sphere sits the almighty surrounded by nine UNknown of angels
and he is the one keeping the UNknown revolving
deep down in the earth 's core lies hell where those tempted by the devil shall suffer forever
in the upper part of the following picture from the french historian UNknown
the devils are stuffing the damned into large pots
a sinner is thrown straight into the fire burning under one of the UNknown
a devil pours the nasty sulfur UNknown from a horn down a man 's throat
two monsters torment some of the damned with their sharp teeth
i have found a strange old mechanical presentation of hell which offers a good understanding of the beliefs in the middle ages
observe the eagerness with which the devils tend to the fire under the UNknown !
during the middle ages devils and hell were considered real and constantly feared
witches were thought to have signed an unlawful pact with the devil and therefore they were burned at the stake
the floating figure is a devil coming to get the witch by lifting her up into the air
this picture of a pyre as well as the following one are from german life in the past in pictures
in this image a witch is milking an ax handle
in the following image a witch has bewitched a man 's shoe
witches usually meet in UNknown
and after the gathering they might for instance sneak into a barn and UNknown a cow
the small UNknown symbol noticeable under the drawing was usually carved into the barn door as protection against witches
in this old na ve drawing a sorcerer and a witch are casting spells setting a village on fire
witches were believed to curse people with diseases with the help of sorcerer 's powder and magic UNknown
notice how the sick person is laying naked in bed
that was UNknown in the past
it was a general belief that the witch was naked when at night during the so called witch sabbath she danced with the devils
women who wanted to participate in the sabbath sneaked away to the sorcerer
where they could have their backs smeared with witch ointment
the witchcraft of the ointment would allow them to fly through the air
the french doctors UNknown and UNknown gave me the following pictures of the witch sabbath a secret UNknown rite to which thousands of women UNknown their participation
at the sabbath witches and UNknown first UNknown the church 's holy cross
satan gives all the UNknown devils names
and a ceremonial banquet is held
the sabbath food was often prepared from corpses from the gallows
all witches had to show the devil their respect by kissing his behind
after a merry dance with the devils the witches fly home at the first crow of the cock
these scenes are often found on famous witch sabbath pictures from the middle ages and the renaissance
to be continued
tonight the stars shine UNknown over the gallows hill
ugh what a stench !
the thief 's body has been hanging too long on the gallows
when such a thief 's finger is too dried out it can no longer lend the brew any healing power
hurry and open up UNknown so that the UNknown by won 't see me
UNknown can you perchance get me a love potion that has power over a pious man of the church ?
here young maiden take a potion of cat UNknown and dove hearts boiled in the moonlight
a drop of this in a man 's drink will soften his heart at once
UNknown can i have an even stronger potion ?
if the maiden wishes to drive the man out of his wits for love
i have a potion boiled in may from a young and playful male sparrow
hold your coin maiden !
first smell my ointment !
this salve is good should you wish to travel to UNknown one night
secretly smear this salve on and the pious monk might directly come to your chamber
you will fly together high up in the night and he will bestow upon you many hungry kisses
listen brother i wonder shouldn 't we pray before we embark in such a bold enterprise ?
oh holy mother forgive us for cutting open a person 's dead body with a knife !
it is not from untimely curiosity that we so badly sin
but so that the cause of many terrible diseases might be revealed to us
such were the middle ages when witchcraft and the devil 's work were sought everywhere
and that is why unusual things were believed to be true
damned woman !
you watch out !
so it happens with witchcraft as with the devil ; people 's belief in him was so strong that he became real
the devil is everywhere and takes all shapes
he shows himself as a nightmare a raging demon a UNknown a lover and a knight
the devils companion can be young and beautiful but she is more often old poor and miserable
is it from the eternal fright of the pyre that you get drunk every night you poor old woman of the middle ages ?
when the evening bell tolls in the night and all fires in town are covered with ashes the devil UNknown UNknown for his adventures
high up in the air is UNknown 's dream castle and there the devil will fulfill all her secret wishes
to be continued
a woman suspected of witchcraft is thrown into the water to find out whether she is guilty or not
in history of customs edward UNknown shows us how the accused is tied up
two UNknown use oars to move the accused in the water where she has no support
if she floats she will be pulled up and burned
if she sinks the judges thank god for her innocence
i will now UNknown a trial for witchcraft from beginning to end taking place at the time when the pope sent traveling inquisition priests out to germany
oh my husband could not have been struck by dizziness so suddenly unless a sorceress had bewitched him !
be comforted anna wife of the printer the power of lead will soon reveal it
oh you powerful UNknown allow this lead to show if UNknown the printer is bewitched
it is written here in the shape of lead that his dizziness is atrocious witchcraft
oh peter look where is the evil sorceress ?
you might see that witch before you wish to
before i wish to
i did not hear you come maria the weaver !
oh maiden please have mercy on me a poor woman who has to go begging from door to door !
are you hungry maria ?
if so sit down
watch out little sister watch out
that woman has evil eyes
the youngest servant of the inquisition may not exchange words with a strange maiden
how wonderful !
young maiden you know quite well that what you 'r e accusing this woman of UNknown her life ?
swear by the cross that you are not deadly enemies !
let 's go young men before her feet are lifted so that the evil witch won 't turn us all into mice
now you can have a UNknown death just what you deserve you damned mistress of the devil !
to be continued
maria the weaver was just taken here accused of witchcraft
master look carefully there might be witch powder hidden in the sorceress hair
the suspect 's nights are now dictated by the inquisition judges
two honorable men try UNknown to persuade her to confess
if she UNknown denies her charges they will use a kind of mental torture
woman see here the seven holy words of jesus crucified written on consecrated UNknown
i will hang them around her neck so that the devil will no longer help her to be silent
does she see this length of consecrated wax as corpus UNknown ?
the accused is taken backwards into the torture chamber so as not to UNknown the judge when entering
for the last time i ask
does she want to confess her witchcraft and her UNknown ?
let her suffering begin so that we might put an end to the UNknown of her heart
oh you learned men !
how do you expect me to confess to that which is not true ?
well UNknown the executioner !
let now the evil witch 's body sting
let her catch her breath UNknown the executioner and loosen the screw a little at a time as she confesses her sins
oh learned men !
and when i gave birth UNknown and all her UNknown helped me
if i am spared the pain i will confess that trina has smeared me with witch ointment
oh yes learned men miserable me has flown through the night air to UNknown on trina 's broom
and the devil 's grandmother was there with all her witchcraft
and many a woman who had not accomplished enough evil deeds was treated miserably by the devil
and masses spat upon all that is holy
and a meal of UNknown and UNknown children was cooked by UNknown
listen maria the weaver did you also see how the devil put his mark on the witches UNknown ?
oh learned men i saw the witches kiss the evil one on his behind
and anna 's mother the wife of the printer who wished me a UNknown death
that damned woman i saw her kissing the evil one so tenderly and UNknown her servant that old fool was also there
and elsa who kicked me some time ago she shall also burn at the stake
she passed martin the writer 's door one moonlit night with her sister
and they cast a spell on martin the writer with the water they threw against his door
and it was the very same night that death took martin the writer
and now i will tell you everything about the witches who yell after me in the street where i live
to be continued
each witch gives ten others away
the town wardens busy themselves
if you oppose the capture of a witch you must be a witch yourself
the destiny of young anna wife of the printer is sealed
so now only two people are left in UNknown the printer 's haunted house
during the witchcraft era it was dangerous to be old and ugly but it was not safe to be young and pretty either
brother help me
i UNknown l whip your sinful body and your poor soul into faith healing
oh brother why did you stop the beating of the scourge ?
now my soul will surely be damned
father henrik brother john is UNknown
a witch appears in his cell to tempt him
and she has grabbed him by the wrist
stand up brother father henrik is coming
brother you have not given the maiden away for a witch have you ?
you know the punishment for those who refuse to witness against a witch ?
and so they fetch you too young maiden giving you their UNknown test
in the name of the holy trinity if you are not a witch you will now shed tears !
see for yourself you cannot shed tears as you are allied with the evil one
we assume now that the young woman UNknown ; that no threat and no pain can persuade her to confess
i have tried to find out how the excellent inquisition judges behaved in such circumstances
and i see in front of me some scenes which i do not find pictured too UNknown here on the white screen
wake up young maiden !
i bring you great happiness
see young maiden i give you your freedom
if you would just show me a small favor in return
why do you taunt me monk ?
what favor can a poor creature like me show you ?
teach me the beautiful art of making thunder with this water !
if you do not want to take my word young maiden stand up and look out at the jail court
did the guards leave ?
yes they went far away maiden
the keys are now in my hand and i can secretly take you out through the town gates tonight
and i swear eternal silence to you maiden about all you will reveal about witchcraft with thunder
do you remember maiden that UNknown the printer 's child is all alone in the world without relatives besides you ?
oh father henrik see the tears of the young maiden
look she cries hence she cannot be a sorceress
silly boy !
here maiden see the child who will miserably perish as a dishonorable rejected witch 's offspring without you
stand here and listen to all the maiden 's words so that later you may bear witness against her
and will you secretly open the jail gates for the child and me if i speak ?
then i will tell you that once a traveling stone cutter told me
that when witches call for thunder they put their hands in the water
you hardened witch !
and then they will burn you too maiden
as UNknown for man as sweet scent for god
and one pyre after another burns in the town square until the judges will one day move on to the next town
the witch madness like a spiritual plague UNknown wherever these judges go
in the arc of a few centuries over 8 million women men and children were burned as witches
to be continued
many women for instance confess that transformed into cats they soiled the altar during the night while two devils in the shape of animals stood guard at the church door
but there are also confessions which might very well be close to the truth namely during the times when superstition ruled
many women were burned because they confessed that they bewitched a marriage bed by tying knots !
for each knot a pregnancy is destroyed
and the happiness of a whole house could be ruined with witch hair and metal crosses
many women have probably really used such magic tricks and believed in their destructive effects
but if we should judge from the confessions we must take a closer look at the props in the torture chamber
you and i would also be driven to confess mysterious talents with the help of such tools
isn 't that so ?
the french doctor paul UNknown describes the way this collar was used
the collar was UNknown with the help of four UNknown ropes
the wrists and ankles of the accused were tied to two iron rods screwed to the floor
when a fire bowl was put under the poor victim
his movements were so violent that the spikes of the collar entered his neck
doctor UNknown shows another picture which speaks for itself
it is simply called after the interrogation
the painful interrogation preferably began with a lighter torture
the UNknown for example
i will not reveal the terrible confessions i forced from the young lady in less than a minute
in the UNknown during the middle ages fear of the devil UNknown into an almost hopeless despair
the pious gave themselves up to many a regrettable self punishment
often a single nun was seized and suddenly thereafter the whole convent was UNknown by insanity
a mysterious contagious insanity
get thee behind me satan !
may all good saints stand by me !
sister cecilia is conniving with the evil one
how these religious women must have suffered before their nerves abandoned them and insanity broke out ?
in their UNknown this desperate cry is always found
the devil forced us into it !
oh holy mother the evil has a terrible power !
look now he forces me into doing what i want the least
burn me at the stake pious fathers !
can 't you see what the devil forces me to do ?
take me !
the evil one stands over there and threatens me
to be continued
and come to present times
the majority of witches in the old days were poor women ; those who are taken in by pious organizations and nursing homes nowadays
one or more traits that might make an old woman noticeable was enough to bring her to court during the witchcraft era
let us not believe that the devil belongs solely to the past
the lovely old woman who plays the role of maria the weaver in my film once raised her tired face to me during a pause in the shoot
with the old woman 's permission i show here the prayer book in which a woman from 1921 !
thinks she can tell the devil by sight
the witch 's insanity can be explained as a nervous exhaustion that i will try to UNknown here
i ask my viewer to understand that in the following i let the same actress
UNknown many different patients of related nervous disorders
i have personally known a very nervous young woman who often walked in her sleep
why did she always UNknown the very same thing she was most afraid she would do ?
like a witch forced by the devil this woman
both when sleeping and awake gives way to a mysterious craving to strike matches
had this possession anything to do with her morbid fear of fire after one broke out in her home ?
she stated that she felt as if she were fighting against an unknown force stronger than her own
isn 't there something witch like with this sleepwalker who moves through the UNknown household with her matches ?
doesn 't she remind us of the nun who walks through the chapel with her knife forced by the devil ?
this poor woman also in a bewildered condition does during her sleep just what she fears the most
these possessions these UNknown dazed conditions are consistent with the nervous diseases we call hysteria
and there are still more connections between the medieval witch and the modern hysterical person
we remember for instance that the witch received nightly UNknown by the devil
today it is not the devil but rather a famous actor a popular clergyman or a well known doctor who disturbs the calm of the night
the hysterical person will undoubtedly say that these celebrities come to her through the wall or window
notice how consciously this unconscious woman holds onto her bed
a person afflicted by hysteria always UNknown some artificial UNknown
in the middle ages it was believed that during the sabbath the devil put some invisible marks on the witch 's body where all sensitivity vanished
the executioner often found insensitive areas on the back of the accused
i see clearly that you are a witch
you do not even feel the master 's instrument on your back
today this strange UNknown is considered a symptom of hysteria
no sir i do not feel you touching my back at all
yes it is as i thought ; your daughter is suffering from hysteria
from what you told me i must strongly recommend that we detain your daughter for the time being in my clinic
it would be a pity if your daughter were to have an unpleasant exchange with the police
poor little hysterical witch !
in the middle ages you were in conflict with the church
now it is with the law
i ask you to step into my office
or do you prefer that i call the police ?
your name ?
your address ?
thank you that 's fine
you can leave
if my family learns about this i will be UNknown detained
i beg you to understand that i am an unhappy sick person
i do not know what i am doing
i have not been able to live with this persistent fear during the war
i am a broken person
it is as if an unknown power UNknown me to commit this terrible theft
look here !
what shall i do with it ?
i do not know a word of russian
my husband died in the war and i have not been the same since
i promise not to pursue this matter but i have to ask you never to visit my store again
centuries have passed and the almighty of medieval times no longer sits in his tenth sphere
we no longer sit in church staring terrified at the UNknown of the devils
the witch no longer flies away on her broom over the rooftops
but isn 't superstition still UNknown among us ?
is there an obvious difference between the sorceress and her customer then and now ?
we no longer burn our old and poor
but do they not often suffer bitterly ?
and the little woman whom we call hysterical alone and unhappy isn 't she still a riddle for us ?
nowadays we detain the unhappy in a mental institution or
if she is wealthy in a modern clinic
and then we will console ourselves with the notion that the mildly UNknown shower of the clinic has replaced the barbaric methods of medieval times
a presentation from a cultural and historical point of view in 7 chapters of moving pictures
UNknown UNknown wrote the script and produced this film between the years of 1 91 9 and 1 921
for the photography i am grateful to mr johan UNknown and to mr richard UNknown for the art direction
my main sources are mentioned in the theatre 's UNknown
let us look into the history of UNknown and try to explain the mysterious chapter known as the witch
the belief in sorcery and witchcraft is probably as old as mankind
when primitive man is confronted with something incomprehensible the explanation is always sorcery and evil spirits
in persia the imaginary creatures UNknown in the following picture were thus believed to be the cause of diseases
the english scientist UNknown and french scientist UNknown show us pictures of evil spirits believed to have UNknown amongst the first UNknown
the belief in evil spirits sorcery and witchcraft is the result of naive notions about the mystery of the universe
here we see how the egyptians UNknown the shape of the world according to UNknown
the ancient egyptians believed that high mountains surrounded land and water on all sides
the sky was made of steel and supported by strong pillars that stood on the high mountains
the stars like lamps hung from the sky on ropes
according to the beliefs of other ancient UNknown the sky was UNknown and the earth shaped into terraces
the evil spirits of ancient times changed in the medieval UNknown to devils sneaking around and tempting children
the devils lived in the earth 's core
in the latter part of the middle ages the earth was considered to be a stationary sphere in the middle of the universe
above the earth and its waters
the medieval man first imagined a layer of air
then a layer of fire
and outside the fire were the planets moving celestial bodies
each planet was attached to its transparent UNknown sphere
and outside the planetary UNknown were the fixed stars arranged in a sky of their own
above it all in the tenth crystal sphere sits the almighty surrounded by nine UNknown of angels
and he is the one keeping the UNknown revolving
deep down in the earth 's core lies hell where those tempted by the devil shall suffer forever
in the upper part of the following picture from the french historian UNknown the devils are stuffing the damned into large pots
a sinner is thrown straight into the fire burning under one of the UNknown
a devil pours the nasty sulfur UNknown from a horn down a man 's throat
two monsters torment some of the damned with their sharp teeth
i have found a strange old mechanical presentation of hell which offers a good understanding of the beliefs in the middle ages
observe the eagerness with which the devils tend to the fire under the UNknown !
during the middle ages devils and hell were considered real and constantly feared
witches were thought to have signed an unlawful pact with the devil and therefore they were burned at the stake
the floating figure is a devil coming to get the witch by lifting her up into the air
this picture of a pyre as well as the following one are from german life in the past in pictures
in this image a witch is milking an ax handle
in the following image a witch has bewitched a man 's shoe
witches usually meet in UNknown
and after the gathering they might for instance sneak into a barn and UNknown a cow
the small UNknown symbol noticeable under the drawing was usually carved into the barn door as protection against witches
in this old naive drawing a sorcerer and a witch are casting spells setting a village on fire
witches were believed to curse people with diseases with the help of sorcerer 's powder and magic UNknown
notice how the sick person is laying naked in bed
that was UNknown in the past
it was a general belief that the witch was naked when at night during the so called witch sabbath she danced with the devils
women who wanted to participate in the sabbath sneaked away to the sorcerer
where they could have their backs smeared with witch ointment
the witchcraft of the ointment would allow them to fly through the air
the french doctors UNknown and UNknown gave me the following pictures of the witch sabbath a secret UNknown rite to which thousands of women UNknown their participation
at the sabbath witches and UNknown first UNknown the church 's holy cross

tonight the stars shine UNknown over the gallows hill
ugh what a stench !
the thief 's body has been hanging too long on the gallows
when such a thief 's finger is too dried out it can no longer lend the brew any healing power
hurry and open up UNknown so that the UNknown by won 't see me
UNknown can you perchance get me a love potion that has power over a pious man of the church ?
here young maiden take a potion of cat UNknown and dove hearts boiled in the moonlight
a drop of this in a man 's drink will soften his heart at once
UNknown can i have an even stronger potion ?
lf the maiden wishes to drive the man out of his wits for love
l have a potion boiled in may from a young and playful male sparrow
hold your coin maiden !
first smell my ointment !
this salve is good should you wish to travel to UNknown one night
secretly smear this salve on and the pious monk might directly come to your chamber
you will fly together high up in the night and he will bestow upon you many hungry kisses
listen brother i wonder shouldn 't we pray before we embark in such a bold enterprise ?
oh holy mother forgive us for cutting open a person 's dead body with a knife !
it is not from untimely curiosity that we so badly sin
but so that the cause of many terrible diseases might be revealed to us
such were the middle ages when witchcraft and the devil 's work were sought everywhere
and that is why unusual things were believed to be true
damned woman !
you watch out !
so it happens with witchcraft as with the devil ; people 's belief in him was so strong that he became real
the devil is everywhere and takes all shapes
he shows himself as a nightmare a raging demon a UNknown a lover and a knight
the devils companion can be young and beautiful but she is more often old poor and miserable
is it from the eternal fright of the pyre that you get drunk every night you poor old woman of the middle ages ?
when the evening bell tolls in the night and all fires in town are covered with ashes the devil UNknown UNknown for his adventures
high up in the air is UNknown 's dream castle and there the devil will fulfill all her secret wishes
to be continued
a woman suspected of witchcraft is thrown into the water to find out whether she is guilty or not
in history of customs edward UNknown shows us how the accused is tied up
two UNknown use oars to move the accused in the water where she has no support

if she sinks the judges thank god for her innocence
i will now UNknown a trial for witchcraft from beginning to end taking place at the time when the pope sent traveling inquisition priests out to germany
oh my husband could not have been struck by dizziness so suddenly unless a sorceress had bewitched him !
be comforted anna wife of the printer the power of lead will soon reveal it
oh you powerful UNknown allow this lead to show if UNknown the printer is bewitched
it is written here in the shape of lead that his dizziness is atrocious witchcraft
oh peter look where is the evil sorceress ?
you might see that witch before you wish to

the youngest servant of the inquisition may not exchange words with a strange maiden
how wonderful !
young maiden you know quite well that what you 'r e accusing this woman of UNknown her life ?
swear by the cross that you are not deadly enemies !
let 's go young men before her feet are lifted so that the evil witch won 't turn us all into mice
now you can have a UNknown death just what you deserve you damned mistress of the devil !
to be continued
maria the weaver was just taken here accused of witchcraft
master look carefully there might be witch powder hidden in the sorceress hair
the suspect 's nights are now dictated by the inquisition judges
two honorable men try UNknown to persuade her to confess
if she UNknown denies her charges they will use a kind of mental torture
woman see here the seven holy words of jesus crucified written on consecrated UNknown
i will hang them around her neck so that the devil will no longer help her to be silent
does she see this length of consecrated wax as corpus UNknown ?
the accused is taken backwards into the torture chamber so as not to UNknown the judge when entering
for the last time i ask does she want to confess her witchcraft and her UNknown ?
let her suffering begin so that we might put an end to the UNknown of her heart
oh you learned men !
how do you expect me to confess to that which is not true ?
well UNknown the executioner !
let now the evil witch 's body sting
let her catch her breath UNknown the executioner and loosen the screw a little at a time as she confesses her sins
oh learned men !
and when i gave birth UNknown and all her UNknown helped me
lf i am spared the pain i will confess that trina has smeared me with witch ointment
oh yes learned men miserable me has flown through the night air to UNknown on trina 's broom
and the devil 's grandmother was there with all her witchcraft
and many a woman who had not accomplished enough evil deeds was treated miserably by the devil
and masses spat upon all that is holy
and a meal of UNknown and UNknown children was cooked by UNknown
listen maria the weaver did you also see how the devil put his mark on the witches UNknown ?
oh learned men i saw the witches kiss the evil one on his behind
and anna 's mother the wife of the printer who wished me a UNknown death
that damned woman i saw her kissing the evil one so tenderly and UNknown her servant that old fool was also there
and elsa who kicked me some time ago she shall also burn at the stake
she passed martin the writer 's door one moonlit night with her sister
and they cast a spell on martin the writer with the water they threw against his door
and it was the very same night that death took martin the writer
and now i will tell you everything about the witches who yell after me in the street where i live
to be continued
each witch gives ten others away
the town wardens busy themselves
if you oppose the capture of a witch you must be a witch yourself
the destiny of young anna wife of the printer is sealed
so now only two people are left in UNknown the printer 's haunted house
during the witchcraft era it was dangerous to be old and ugly but it was not safe to be young and pretty either
brother help me
i UNknown l whip your sinful body and your poor soul into faith healing
oh brother why did you stop the beating of the scourge ?
now my soul will surely be damned
father henrik brother john is UNknown
a witch appears in his cell to tempt him
and she has grabbed him by the wrist
stand up brother father henrik is coming
brother you have not given the maiden away for a witch have you ?
you know the punishment for those who refuse to witness against a witch ?
and so they fetch you too young maiden giving you their UNknown test
ln the name of the holy trinity if you are not a witch you will now shed tears !
see for yourself you cannot shed tears as you are allied with the evil one
we assume now that the young woman UNknown ; that no threat and no pain can persuade her to confess
i have tried to find out how the excellent inquisition judges behaved in such circumstances
and i see in front of me some scenes which i do not find pictured too UNknown here on the white screen
wake up young maiden !
i bring you great happiness
see young maiden i give you your freedom
if you would just show me a small favor in return
why do you taunt me monk ?
what favor can a poor creature like me show you ?
teach me the beautiful art of making thunder with this water !
lf you do not want to take my word young maiden stand up and look out at the jail court
did the guards leave ?
yes they went far away maiden
the keys are now in my hand and i can secretly take you out through the town gates tonight
and i swear eternal silence to you maiden about all you will reveal about witchcraft with thunder
do you remember maiden that UNknown the printer 's child is all alone in the world without relatives besides you ?
oh father henrik see the tears of the young maiden
look she cries hence she cannot be a sorceress
silly boy !
here maiden see the child who will miserably perish as a dishonorable rejected witch 's offspring without you
stand here and listen to all the maiden 's words so that later you may bear witness against her
and will you secretly open the jail gates for the child and me if i speak ?
then i will tell you that once a traveling stone cutter told me
that when witches call for thunder they put their hands in the water
you hardened witch !
and then they will burn you too maiden
as UNknown for man as sweet scent for god
and one pyre after another burns in the town square until the judges will one day move on to the next town
the witch madness like a spiritual plague UNknown wherever these judges go
in the arc of a few centuries over 8 million women men and children were burned as witches
to be continued
many women for instance confess that transformed into cats they soiled the altar during the night while two devils in the shape of animals stood guard at the church door
but there are also confessions which might very well be close to the truth namely during the times when superstition ruled
many women were burned because they confessed that they bewitched a marriage bed by tying knots !
for each knot a pregnancy is destroyed
and the happiness of a whole house could be ruined with witch hair and metal crosses
many women have probably really used such magic tricks and believed in their destructive effects
but if we should judge from the confessions we must take a closer look at the props in the torture chamber
you and i would also be driven to confess mysterious talents with the help of such tools
lsn 't that so ?
the french doctor paul UNknown describes the way this collar was used
the collar was UNknown with the help of four UNknown ropes
the wrists and ankles of the accused were tied to two iron rods screwed to the floor
when a fire bowl was put under the poor victim
his movements were so violent that the spikes of the collar entered his neck
doctor UNknown shows another picture which speaks for itself
it is simply called after the interrogation
the painful interrogation preferably began with a lighter torture the UNknown for example
one of my actresses insisted on trying the UNknown when we shot these pictures
i will not reveal the terrible confessions i forced from the young lady in less than a minute
in the UNknown during the middle ages fear of the devil UNknown into an almost hopeless despair
the pious gave themselves up to many a regrettable self punishment
often a single nun was seized and suddenly thereafter the whole convent was UNknown by insanity
a mysterious contagious insanity
get thee behind me satan !
may all good saints stand by me !
sister cecilia is conniving with the evil one
how these religious women must have suffered before their nerves abandoned them and insanity broke out ?
in their UNknown this desperate cry is always found
the devil forced us into it !
oh holy mother the evil has a terrible power !
look now he forces me into doing what i want the least
burn me at the stake pious fathers !
can 't you see what the devil forces me to do ?
take me !
the evil one stands over there and threatens me
to be continued
the majority of witches in the old days were poor women ; those who are taken in by pious organizations and nursing homes nowadays
one or more traits that might make an old woman noticeable was enough to bring her to court during the witchcraft era
let us not believe that the devil belongs solely to the past
the lovely old woman who plays the role of maria the weaver in my film once raised her tired face to me during a pause in the shoot
with the old woman 's permission i show here the prayer book in which a woman from 1 921 ! thinks she can tell the devil by sight
the witch 's insanity can be explained as a nervous exhaustion that i will try to UNknown here
i ask my viewer to understand that in the following i let the same actress
UNknown many different patients of related nervous disorders
i have personally known a very nervous young woman who often walked in her sleep
why did she always UNknown the very same thing she was most afraid she would do ?
like a witch forced by the devil this woman
both when sleeping and awake gives way to a mysterious craving to strike matches
had this possession anything to do with her morbid fear of fire after one broke out in her home ?
she stated that she felt as if she were fighting against an unknown force stronger than her own
lsn 't there something witch like with this sleepwalker who moves through the UNknown household with her matches ?
doesn 't she remind us of the nun who walks through the chapel with her knife forced by the devil ?
this poor woman also in a bewildered condition does during her sleep just what she fears the most
these possessions these UNknown dazed conditions are consistent with the nervous diseases we call hysteria
and there are still more connections between the medieval witch and the modern hysterical person
we remember for instance that the witch received nightly UNknown by the devil
today it is not the devil but rather a famous actor a popular clergyman or a well known doctor who disturbs the calm of the night
the hysterical person will undoubtedly say that these celebrities come to her through the wall or window
notice how consciously this unconscious woman holds onto her bed
a person afflicted by hysteria always UNknown some artificial UNknown
in the middle ages it was believed that during the sabbath the devil put some invisible marks on the witch 's body where all sensitivity vanished
the executioner often found insensitive areas on the back of the accused
i see clearly that you are a witch
you do not even feel the master 's instrument on your back
today this strange UNknown is considered a symptom of hysteria
no sir i do not feel you touching my back at all
yes it is as i thought ; your daughter is suffering from hysteria
from what you told me i must strongly recommend that we detain your daughter for the time being in my clinic
it would be a pity if your daughter were to have an unpleasant exchange with the police
poor little hysterical witch !
in the middle ages you were in conflict with the church
now it is with the law
i ask you to step into my office
or do you prefer that i call the police ?
your name ?
your address ?
thank you that 's fine
you can leave
lf my family learns about this i will be UNknown detained
i beg you to understand that i am an unhappy sick person
i do not know what i am doing
i have not been able to live with this persistent fear during the war
i am a broken person
it is as if an unknown power UNknown me to commit this terrible theft
look here !
what shall i do with it ?
i do not know a word of russian
my husband died in the war and i have not been the same since
i promise not to pursue this matter but i have to ask you never to visit my store again
centuries have passed and the almighty of medieval times no longer sits in his tenth sphere
we no longer sit in church staring terrified at the UNknown of the devils
the witch no longer flies away on her broom over the rooftops
but isn 't superstition still UNknown among us ?
is there an obvious difference between the sorceress and her customer then and now ?
we no longer burn our old and poor
but do they not often suffer bitterly ?
and the little woman whom we call hysterical alone and unhappy isn 't she still a riddle for us ?
nowadays we detain the unhappy in a mental institution or
if she is wealthy in a modern clinic
and then we will console ourselves with the notion that the mildly UNknown shower of the clinic has replaced the barbaric methods of medieval times

a presentation from a cultural and historical point of view in 7 chapters of moving pictures
UNknown UNknown wrote the script and produced this film between the years of 1919 and 1921
for the photography i am grateful to mr johan UNknown and to mr richard UNknown for the art direction
my main sources are mentioned in the theatre 's UNknown
let us look into the history of UNknown and try to explain the mysterious chapter known as the witch
the belief in sorcery and witchcraft is probably as old as mankind
when primitive man is confronted with something incomprehensible the explanation is always sorcery and evil spirits
in persia the imaginary creatures UNknown in the following picture were thus believed to be the cause of diseases
the english scientist UNknown and french scientist UNknown show us pictures of evil spirits believed to have UNknown amongst the first UNknown
the belief in evil spirits sorcery and witchcraft is the result of naive notions about the mystery of the universe
here we see how the egyptians UNknown the shape of the world according to UNknown
the ancient egyptians believed that high mountains surrounded land and water on all sides
the sky was made of steel and supported by strong pillars that stood on the high mountains
the stars like lamps hung from the sky on ropes
according to the beliefs of other ancient UNknown the sky was UNknown and the earth shaped into terraces
the evil spirits of ancient times changed in the medieval UNknown to devils sneaking around and tempting children
the devils lived in the earth 's core
in the latter part of the middle ages the earth was considered to be a stationary sphere in the middle of the universe
above the earth and its waters
the medieval man first imagined a layer of air
then a layer of fire
and outside the fire were the planets moving celestial bodies
each planet was attached to its transparent UNknown sphere
and outside the planetary UNknown were the fixed stars arranged in a sky of their own
above it all in the tenth crystal sphere sits the almighty surrounded by nine UNknown of angels
and he is the one keeping the UNknown revolving
deep down in the earth 's core lies hell where those tempted by the devil shall suffer forever
in the upper part of the following picture from the french historian UNknown
the devils are stuffing the damned into large pots
a sinner is thrown straight into the fire burning under one of the UNknown
a devil pours the nasty sulfur UNknown from a horn down a man 's throat
two monsters torment some of the damned with their sharp teeth
i have found a strange old mechanical presentation of hell which offers a good understanding of the beliefs in the middle ages
observe the eagerness with which the devils tend to the fire under the UNknown !
during the middle ages devils and hell were considered real and constantly feared
witches were thought to have signed an unlawful pact with the devil and therefore they were burned at the stake
the floating figure is a devil coming to get the witch by lifting her up into the air
this picture of a pyre as well as the following one are from german life in the past in pictures
in this image a witch is milking an ax handle
in the following image a witch has bewitched a man 's shoe
witches usually meet in UNknown
and after the gathering they might for instance sneak into a barn and UNknown a cow
the small UNknown symbol noticeable under the drawing was usually carved into the barn door as protection against witches
in this old naive drawing a sorcerer and a witch are casting spells setting a village on fire
witches were believed to curse people with diseases with the help of sorcerer 's powder and magic UNknown
notice how the sick person is laying naked in bed
that was UNknown in the past
it was a general belief that the witch was naked when at night during the so called witch sabbath she danced with the devils
women who wanted to participate in the sabbath sneaked away to the sorcerer
where they could have their backs smeared with witch ointment
the witchcraft of the ointment would allow them to fly through the air
the french doctors UNknown and UNknown gave me the following pictures of the witch sabbath a secret UNknown rite to which thousands of women UNknown their participation
at the sabbath witches and UNknown first UNknown the church 's holy cross
satan gives all the UNknown devils names
and a ceremonial banquet is held
the sabbath food was often prepared from corpses from the gallows
all witches had to show the devil their respect by kissing his behind
after a merry dance with the devils the witches fly home at the first crow of the cock
these scenes are often found on famous witch sabbath pictures from the middle ages and the renaissance
to be continued
tonight the stars shine UNknown over the gallows hill
ugh what a stench !
the thief 's body has been hanging too long on the gallows
when such a thief 's finger is too dried out it can no longer lend the brew any healing power
hurry and open up UNknown so that the UNknown by won 't see me
UNknown can you perchance get me a love potion that has power over a pious man of the church ?
here young maiden take a potion of cat UNknown and dove hearts boiled in the moonlight
a drop of this in a man 's drink will soften his heart at once
UNknown can i have an even stronger potion ?
if the maiden wishes to drive the man out of his wits for love
i have a potion boiled in may from a young and playful male sparrow
hold your coin maiden !
first smell my ointment !
this salve is good should you wish to travel to UNknown one night
secretly smear this salve on and the pious monk might directly come to your chamber
you will fly together high up in the night and he will bestow upon you many hungry kisses
listen brother i wonder shouldn 't we pray before we embark in such a bold enterprise ?
oh holy mother forgive us for cutting open a person 's dead body with a knife !
it is not from untimely curiosity that we so badly sin
but so that the cause of many terrible diseases might be revealed to us
such were the middle ages when witchcraft and the devil 's work were sought everywhere
and that is why unusual things were believed to be true
damned woman !
you watch out !
so it happens with witchcraft as with the devil ; people 's belief in him was so strong that he became real
the devil is everywhere and takes all shapes
he shows himself as a nightmare a raging demon a UNknown a lover and a knight
the devils companion can be young and beautiful but she is more often old poor and miserable
is it from the eternal fright of the pyre that you get drunk every night you poor old woman of the middle ages ?
when the evening bell tolls in the night and all fires in town are covered with ashes the devil UNknown UNknown for his adventures
high up in the air is UNknown 's dream castle and there the devil will fulfill all her secret wishes
to be continued
a woman suspected of witchcraft is thrown into the water to find out whether she is guilty or not
in history of customs edward UNknown shows us how the accused is tied up
two UNknown use oars to move the accused in the water where she has no support
if she floats she will be pulled up and burned
if she sinks the judges thank god for her innocence
i will now UNknown a trial for witchcraft from beginning to end taking place at the time when the pope sent traveling inquisition priests out to germany
oh my husband could not have been struck by dizziness so suddenly unless a sorceress had bewitched him !
be comforted anna wife of the printer the power of lead will soon reveal it
oh you powerful UNknown allow this lead to show if UNknown the printer is bewitched
it is written here in the shape of lead that his dizziness is atrocious witchcraft
oh peter look where is the evil sorceress ?
you might see that witch before you wish to

how do you expect me to confess to that which is not true ?
well UNknown the executioner !
let now the evil witch 's body sting
let her catch her breath UNknown the executioner and loosen the screw a little at a time as she confesses her sins

above it all in the tenth crystal sphere sits the almighty surrounded by nine UNknown of angels
and he is the one keeping the UNknown revolving
deep down in the earth 's core lies hell where those tempted by the devil shall suffer forever
in the upper part of the following picture from the french historian UNknown the devils are stuffing the damned into large pots
a sinner is thrown straight into the fire burning under one of the UNknown
a devil pours the nasty sulfur UNknown from a horn down a man 's throat
two monsters torment some of the damned with their sharp teeth
i have found a strange old mechanical presentation of hell which offers a good understanding of the beliefs in the middle ages
observe the eagerness with which the devils tend to the fire under the UNknown !
during the middle ages devils and hell were considered real and constantly feared
witches were thought to have signed an unlawful pact with the devil and therefore they were burned at the stake
the floating figure is a devil coming to get the witch by lifting her up into the air
this picture of a pyre as well as the following one are from german life in the past in pictures
in this image a witch is milking an ax handle
in the following image a witch has bewitched a man 's shoe
witches usually meet in UNknown
and after the gathering they might for instance sneak into a barn and UNknown a cow
the small UNknown symbol noticeable under the drawing was usually carved into the barn door as protection against witches
in this old naive drawing a sorcerer and a witch are casting spells setting a village on fire
witches were believed to curse people with diseases with the help of sorcerer 's powder and magic UNknown
notice how the sick person is laying naked in bed
that was UNknown in the past
it was a general belief that the witch was naked when at night during the so called witch sabbath she danced with the devils
women who wanted to participate in the sabbath sneaked away to the sorcerer
where they could have their backs smeared with witch ointment
the witchcraft of the ointment would allow them to fly through the air
the french doctors UNknown and UNknown gave me the following pictures of the witch sabbath a secret UNknown rite to which thousands of women UNknown their participation
at the sabbath witches and UNknown first UNknown the church 's holy cross
satan gives all the UNknown devils names
and a ceremonial banquet is held
the sabbath food was often prepared from corpses from the gallows
all witches had to show the devil their respect by kissing his behind
after a merry dance with the devils the witches fly home at the first crow of the cock
these scenes are often found on famous witch sabbath pictures from the middle ages and the renaissance
to be continued
tonight the stars shine UNknown over the gallows hill
ugh what a stench !
the thief 's body has been hanging too long on the gallows
when such a thief 's finger is too dried out it can no longer lend the brew any healing power
hurry and open up UNknown so that the UNknown by won 't see me
UNknown can you perchance get me a love potion that has power over a pious man of the church ?
here young maiden take a potion of cat UNknown and dove hearts boiled in the moonlight
a drop of this in a man 's drink will soften his heart at once
UNknown can i have an even stronger potion ?
lf the maiden wishes to drive the man out of his wits for love
i have a potion boiled in may from a young and playful male sparrow
hold your coin maiden !
first smell my ointment !
this salve is good should you wish to travel to UNknown one night
secretly smear this salve on and the pious monk might directly come to your chamber
you will fly together high up in the night and he will bestow upon you many hungry kisses
listen brother i wonder shouldn 't we pray before we embark in such a bold enterprise ?
oh holy mother forgive us for cutting open a person 's dead body with a knife !
it is not from untimely curiosity that we so badly sin
but so that the cause of many terrible diseases might be revealed to us
such were the middle ages when witchcraft and the devil 's work were sought everywhere
and that is why unusual things were believed to be true
damned woman !
you watch out !
so it happens with witchcraft as with the devil ; people 's belief in him was so strong that he became real
the devil is everywhere and takes all shapes
he shows himself as a nightmare a raging demon a UNknown a lover and a knight
the devils companion can be young and beautiful but she is more often old poor and miserable
is it from the eternal fright of the pyre that you get drunk every night you poor old woman of the middle ages ?
when the evening bell tolls in the night and all fires in town are covered with ashes the devil UNknown UNknown for his adventures
high up in the air is UNknown 's dream castle and there the devil will fulfill all her secret wishes
to be continued
a woman suspected of witchcraft is thrown into the water to find out whether she is guilty or not
in history of customs edward UNknown shows us how the accused is tied up
two UNknown use oars to move the accused in the water where she has no support
if she floats she will be pulled up and burned
if she sinks the judges thank god for her innocence
i will now UNknown a trial for witchcraft from beginning to end taking place at the time when the pope sent traveling inquisition priests out to germany
oh my husband could not have been struck by dizziness so suddenly unless a sorceress had bewitched him !
be comforted anna wife of the printer the power of lead will soon reveal it
oh you powerful UNknown allow this lead to show if UNknown the printer is bewitched
it is written here in the shape of lead that his dizziness is atrocious witchcraft
oh peter look where is the evil sorceress ?
you might see that witch before you wish to
before i wish to
i did not hear you come maria the weaver !
oh maiden please have mercy on me a poor woman who has to go begging from door to door !
are you hungry maria ?
if so sit down
watch out little sister watch out
that woman has evil eyes
the youngest servant of the inquisition may not exchange words with a strange maiden
how wonderful !
young maiden you know quite well that what you 'r e accusing this woman of UNknown her life ?
swear by the cross that you are not deadly enemies !
let 's go young men before her feet are lifted so that the evil witch won 't turn us all into mice
now you can have a UNknown death just what you deserve you damned mistress of the devil !
to be continued
maria the weaver was just taken here accused of witchcraft
master look carefully there might be witch powder hidden in the sorceress hair
the suspect 's nights are now dictated by the inquisition judges
two honorable men try UNknown to persuade her to confess
if she UNknown denies her charges they will use a kind of mental torture
woman see here the seven holy words of jesus crucified written on consecrated UNknown
i will hang them around her neck so that the devil will no longer help her to be silent
does she see this length of consecrated wax as corpus UNknown ?
the accused is taken backwards into the torture chamber so as not to UNknown the judge when entering
for the last time i ask does she want to confess her witchcraft and her UNknown ?
let her suffering begin so that we might put an end to the UNknown of her heart
oh you learned men !
how do you expect me to confess to that which is not true ?
well UNknown the executioner !
let now the evil witch 's body sting
let her catch her breath UNknown the executioner and loosen the screw a little at a time as she confesses her sins
oh learned men !
and when i gave birth UNknown and all her UNknown helped me
lf i am spared the pain i will confess that trina has smeared me with witch ointment
oh yes learned men miserable me has flown through the night air to UNknown on trina 's broom
and the devil 's grandmother was there with all her witchcraft
and many a woman who had not accomplished enough evil deeds was treated miserably by the devil
and masses spat upon all that is holy
and a meal of UNknown and UNknown children was cooked by UNknown
listen maria the weaver did you also see how the devil put his mark on the witches UNknown ?
oh learned men i saw the witches kiss the evil one on his behind
and anna 's mother the wife of the printer who wished me a UNknown death
that damned woman i saw her kissing the evil one so tenderly and UNknown her servant that old fool was also there
and elsa who kicked me some time ago she shall also burn at the stake
she passed martin the writer 's door one moonlit night with her sister
and they cast a spell on martin the writer with the water they threw against his door
and it was the very same night that death took martin the writer
and now i will tell you everything about the witches who yell after me in the street where i live
to be continued
each witch gives ten others away
the town wardens busy themselves
if you oppose the capture of a witch you must be a witch yourself
the destiny of young anna wife of the printer is sealed
so now only two people are left in UNknown the printer 's haunted house
during the witchcraft era it was dangerous to be old and ugly but it was not safe to be young and pretty either
brother help me
i UNknown l whip your sinful body and your poor soul into faith healing
oh brother why did you stop the beating of the scourge ?
now my soul will surely be damned
father henrik brother john is UNknown
a witch appears in his cell to tempt him
and she has grabbed him by the wrist
stand up brother father henrik is coming
brother you have not given the maiden away for a witch have you ?
you know the punishment for those who refuse to witness against a witch ?
and so they fetch you too young maiden giving you their UNknown test
ln the name of the holy trinity if you are not a witch you will now shed tears !
see for yourself you cannot shed tears as you are allied with the evil one
we assume now that the young woman UNknown ; that no threat and no pain can persuade her to confess
i have tried to find out how the excellent inquisition judges behaved in such circumstances
and i see in front of me some scenes which i do not find pictured too UNknown here on the white screen
wake up young maiden !
i bring you great happiness
see young maiden i give you your freedom
if you would just show me a small favor in return
why do you taunt me monk ?
what favor can a poor creature like me show you ?
teach me the beautiful art of making thunder with this water !
lf you do not want to take my word young maiden stand up and look out at the jail court
did the guards leave ?
yes they went far away maiden
the keys are now in my hand and i can secretly take you out through the town gates tonight
and i swear eternal silence to you maiden about all you will reveal about witchcraft with thunder
do you remember maiden that UNknown the printer 's child is all alone in the world without relatives besides you ?
oh father henrik see the tears of the young maiden
look she cries hence she cannot be a sorceress
silly boy !
here maiden see the child who will miserably perish as a dishonorable rejected witch 's offspring without you
stand here and listen to all the maiden 's words so that later you may bear witness against her
and will you secretly open the jail gates for the child and me if i speak ?
then i will tell you that once a traveling stone cutter told me
that when witches call for thunder they put their hands in the water
you hardened witch !
and then they will burn you too maiden
as UNknown for man as sweet scent for god
and one pyre after another burns in the town square until the judges will one day move on to the next town
the witch madness like a spiritual plague UNknown wherever these judges go
in the arc of a few centuries over 8 million women men and children were burned as witches
to be continued
many women for instance confess that transformed into cats they soiled the altar during the night while two devils in the shape of animals stood guard at the church door
but there are also confessions which might very well be close to the truth namely during the times when superstition ruled
many women were burned because they confessed that they bewitched a marriage bed by tying knots !
for each knot a pregnancy is destroyed
and the happiness of a whole house could be ruined with witch hair and metal crosses
many women have probably really used such magic tricks and believed in their destructive effects
but if we should judge from the confessions we must take a closer look at the props in the torture chamber
you and i would also be driven to confess mysterious talents with the help of such tools
isn 't that so ?
the french doctor paul UNknown describes the way this collar was used
the collar was UNknown with the help of four UNknown ropes
the wrists and ankles of the accused were tied to two iron rods screwed to the floor
when a fire bowl was put under the poor victim
his movements were so violent that the spikes of the collar entered his neck
doctor UNknown shows another picture which speaks for itself
it is simply called after the interrogation
the painful interrogation preferably began with a lighter torture the UNknown for example
one of my actresses insisted on trying the UNknown when we shot these pictures
i will not reveal the terrible confessions i forced from the young lady in less than a minute
in the UNknown during the middle ages fear of the devil UNknown into an almost hopeless despair
the pious gave themselves up to many a regrettable self punishment
often a single nun was seized and suddenly thereafter the whole convent was UNknown by insanity
a mysterious contagious insanity
get thee behind me satan !
may all good saints stand by me !
sister cecilia is conniving with the evil one
how these religious women must have suffered before their nerves abandoned them and insanity broke out ?
in their UNknown this desperate cry is always found
the devil forced us into it !
oh holy mother the evil has a terrible power !
look now he forces me into doing what i want the least
burn me at the stake pious fathers !
can 't you see what the devil forces me to do ?
take me !
the evil one stands over there and threatens me
to be continued
the majority of witches in the old days were poor women ; those who are taken in by pious organizations and nursing homes nowadays
one or more traits that might make an old woman noticeable was enough to bring her to court during the witchcraft era
let us not believe that the devil belongs solely to the past
the lovely old woman who plays the role of maria the weaver in my film once raised her tired face to me during a pause in the shoot and said
the devil is real
with the old woman 's permission i show here the prayer book in which a woman from 1 921 ! thinks she can tell the devil by sight
the witch 's insanity can be explained as a nervous exhaustion that i will try to UNknown here
i ask my viewer to understand that in the following i let the same actress
UNknown many different patients of related nervous disorders
i have personally known a very nervous young woman who often walked in her sleep
why did she always UNknown the very same thing she was most afraid she would do ?
like a witch forced by the devil this woman
both when sleeping and awake gives way to a mysterious craving to strike matches
had this possession anything to do with her morbid fear of fire after one broke out in her home ?
she stated that she felt as if she were fighting against an unknown force stronger than her own
isn 't there something witch like with this sleepwalker who moves through the UNknown household with her matches ?
doesn 't she remind us of the nun who walks through the chapel with her knife forced by the devil ?
this poor woman also in a bewildered condition does during her sleep just what she fears the most
these possessions these UNknown dazed conditions are consistent with the nervous diseases we call hysteria
and there are still more connections between the medieval witch and the modern hysterical person
we remember for instance that the witch received nightly UNknown by the devil
today it is not the devil but rather a famous actor a popular clergyman or a well known doctor who disturbs the calm of the night
the hysterical person will undoubtedly say that these celebrities come to her through the wall or window
notice how consciously this unconscious woman holds onto her bed
a person afflicted by hysteria always UNknown some artificial UNknown
in the middle ages it was believed that during the sabbath the devil put some invisible marks on the witch 's body where all sensitivity vanished
the executioner often found insensitive areas on the back of the accused
i see clearly that you are a witch
you do not even feel the master 's instrument on your back
today this strange UNknown is considered a symptom of hysteria
no sir i do not feel you touching my back at all
yes it is as i thought ; your daughter is suffering from hysteria
from what you told me i must strongly recommend that we detain your daughter for the time being in my clinic
it would be a pity if your daughter were to have an unpleasant exchange with the police
poor little hysterical witch !
in the middle ages you were in conflict with the church
now it is with the law
i ask you to step into my office
or do you prefer that i call the police ?
your name ?
your address ?
thank you that 's fine
you can leave
lf my family learns about this i will be UNknown detained
i beg you to understand that i am an unhappy sick person
i do not know what i am doing
i have not been able to live with this persistent fear during the war
i am a broken person
it is as if an unknown power UNknown me to commit this terrible theft
look here !
what shall i do with it ?
i do not know a word of russian
my husband died in the war and i have not been the same since
i promise not to pursue this matter but i have to ask you never to visit my store again
centuries have passed and the almighty of medieval times no longer sits in his tenth sphere
we no longer sit in church staring terrified at the UNknown of the devils
the witch no longer flies away on her broom over the rooftops
but isn 't superstition still UNknown among us ?
is there an obvious difference between the sorceress and her customer then and now ?
we no longer burn our old and poor
but do they not often suffer bitterly ?
and the little woman whom we call hysterical alone and unhappy isn 't she still a riddle for us ?
nowadays we detain the unhappy in a mental institution or
if she is wealthy in a modern clinic
and then we will console ourselves with the notion that the mildly UNknown shower of the clinic has replaced the barbaric methods of medieval times
speak it not aloud or life 's pictures will turn to pale shadows and nightmares will rise up to feed on your blood
i have long UNknown on the rise and fall of the great death in my home town of UNknown
here is the story
why have you destroyed them the beautiful flowers ?
not so hasty my young friend !
no one escapes his destiny
there was also a house agent called knock a strange man and the center of much gossip
one thing was sure he paid his people well

i shall take the house the handsome deserted house opposite yours
at the same hour
the doctor described ellen 's UNknown as if the had been trifles
but i know that in that night her soul had heard the call of death
already nosferatu was raising his wings
and hutter far away had heard her cry of warning
the peasants brought him into the hospital yesterday
they said he fell from a mountain
he is still feverish
professor UNknown who studied the secrets of nature later told me about it
the UNknown was chartered and carried his coffins filled with earth

longing for her beloved she searched the waves and the distant horizon
one 's dreams are heavy in this deserted castle but do not fear
i am leaving immediately to return to UNknown and to you
no i have to get away reach home by the shortest possible way !
new plague UNknown science
he is talking in a fever
like an epidemic it spread over the entire ship
the first sailor who had shown the symptoms was followed by the entire crew into the dark grave of the waters
in the light of the setting sun the captain and his first mate said farewell to the last of their companions
i shall go down !
if i haven 't come up again within ten minutes
the ship of death had a new captain
it is a difficult to imagine how young hutter his energies sadly UNknown managed to UNknown the difficulties of his homeward journey
at the same time driven by the fatal breath of the vampire the vessel moved rapidly toward the baltic
i must go to him
he is approaching !!!
the master is here !
i have given much thought to the notion that nosferatu travelled with coffins filled with earth
then i discovered that vampires draw their UNknown power from the cursed ground in which they are buried
i have examined everything there is no living soul on board
varna july 12
departing for the UNknown
the plague is upon us !

all citizens are notified that the honourable magistrate of this town UNknown the moving of plague victims into hospitals to prevent the plague from spreading through the streets
hutter had made ellen promise not to touch the book which had given him such terrifying hallucinations
yet she was unable to withstand its strange fascination
one can recognize that mark of the vampire by the trace of his fangs on the victim 's throat
panic seized the people
who would be stricken tomorrow ?
i shall run over there quickly
i shall get UNknown
of her own free will would she have to give him her blood
the panic stricken town was looking for a UNknown goat
it chose knock
he strangled him !
at that very hour the great death ceased and the shadow of the empire vanished as if overcome by the victorious rays of the living sun

perhaps he is one of them
your experience with that mysterious mr UNknown which karsten told me about prompted me to request your assistance
we do not know why mr UNknown chose not to claim his 150 000 marks
perhaps as a UNknown measure
perhaps on a whim
you should have been with hull for ten minutes !
he will present the promissory note when you least expect it then you shall put me on his track !

good god hurry up !
i am supposed to be in the women 's prison by now !
why are you so obstinate miss carozza ?
if you 'd assist us in clearing up hull 's murder i might be able to arrange privileges for you !
you are sacrificing yourself for a scoundrel who has simply abandoned you and in vain for we are already on his tail !
he is stronger than all of you !
he destroys anybody he wants too !
you too he will destroy if you cross him !
i am supposed to check the electrical wiring in here
the man for whose sake you are here has thrown you away like a squeezed fruit
he knows very well that it might cost you your head and he does not lift a finger to help you
and who can guarantee that no other woman has long since replaced you in his heart ?
give me two days time !
when will wenk be back ?
we can 't rely on her keeping quiet
then we must liquidate !
that will cost you your life my boy !
on whose instructions did you act ?
from him ? !
i will try an experiment i will confront him with la carozza
perhaps one of them will give themselves away
who ? !

they are not taking the usual route !
they are going through mueller street !!
johannes gutter !
see for yourselves that the prisoner is not gutter
but then be sensible and clear the path !
where have the people with the prisoner got to ?
after the incident with la carozza i won 't rest until i know that fellow to be in your special care !
carozza was thoroughly searched when she was brought in
how did she UNknown get the poison ?
even in the women 's prison the great unknown must have his accomplices !
in mueller street we suddenly could not get any further !
god knows who UNknown those people !
wake the countess and tell her that i wish to speak to her
i UNknown e never seen that person before
none of us knew him !
but since he shot his mouth off

i am no longer the man i used to be
i am making mistakes losing my nerve
i intend to leave this town this country countess and i ask you to accompany me !
i want you to become mine !
and i will destroy without mercy any obstacle that stands between us !

state attorney von wenk wishes to know if the countess receives !
i want to have an exact plan of the told palace in my hands within the hour

the woman that woman !
you would have to volunteer to join that carozza woman in prison as if you too had been raided in a gaming club

then mr UNknown must have given me the wrong room number
my name is UNknown hugo UNknown
did you write that ?
the room next door
i have come to tell you that as of today you are under the direct protection of the police !
for about six weeks the authorities have been receiving complaints about some UNknown gamblers
in no case could any card UNknown be proved
but their luck in the game is so extraordinary that something fishy must be going on
it is always somebody different one time a young gentleman at another a respectable petit bourgeois today a blond american tomorrow a black haired russian
your experience with that mysterious mr UNknown which karsten told me about prompted me to request your assistance
am i really nothing more to you than an instrument ?
you should have been with hull for ten minutes !
he will present the promissory note when you least expect it then you shall put me on his track !
one more thing mr hull
please treat my visit as completely personal and confidential

madam allow me to introduce you to mr von wenk a UNknown admirer of your beauty
gentlemen who will take over the bank ?
how does a woman like you get into such company among UNknown gamblers and prostitutes ?
i have become UNknown mr von wenk !
to rise to life i require strong UNknown
but tell me why don 't you gamble ?
i prefer to observe the passions of others triggered by gambling without getting too close to the gamblers themselves
you will accept it ?
cost 50 000 at tiffany in new york !
against the bank !!!
then look at that russian woman when she is losing she is fabulous !
i had only three i wanted to buy but i could not !

la carozza will engineer it
i UNknown e just dropped in UNknown to tell you of a marvelous new club that 's being opened tonight
we absolutely have to go there !
there is no danger i will be there first !
ladies and gentlemen i have the honor and the great pleasure to declare the petit casino open in your esteemed presence !
the petit casino has set itself the task to satisfy your most UNknown demands in every respect
among the most modern settings and decorations you shall be transported back to that golden age whose only motto was
UNknown UNknown that pleases is allowed !
she has no talent !
now ladies and gentlemen you are informed about everything play may commence !
the other world
i am afraid ladies and gentlemen the troublemaker is me !
do not be disturbed ladies and gentlemen i will be happy to keep the countess company !
playing with people and their destinies !
see to it that la carozza does not notice my leaving i am going to telephone the police and have the party raided
on no account leave hull alone !
i have asked dr mabuse to give us the pleasure of his company thursday night
but where is wenk ?
listen the whole thing is bad news
if that state attorney sends the police chasing after us we will be in the soup !
the cars are parked in the side street
the woman !
what do i care about la carozza now ?
let her go to hell !
i give you one more week to liquidate wenk so you can plan everything UNknown but not a minute longer i want to be rid of him !
would it be very impolite if i cancelled that dr mabuse 's invitation ?
i cannot really explain it !
i don 't know why i invited him nor why i now want to withdraw the invitation i
state attorney von wenk wishes to know if the countess receives !
the other day you promised me your help today i come to ask for it
you would have to volunteer to join that carozza woman in prison as if you too had been raided in a gaming club
i am convinced you would succeed where we men have failed to get la carozza to talk !
think this is about getting a lead on one of the most dangerous criminals of all times
you would be doing your duty for society !
this room shall be put in order immediately UNknown !
all right tonight at police headquarters !
miss carozza what a coincidence !!!
just think they arrested me !
at UNknown 's !
i am outraged beside myself !
i have heard that they connect you with that terrible murder story !
were you even in the vicinity when the murder took place ? !
are you not ashamed of yourself ?
he 's at his wits end this state attorney !
and now he 's expecting help from me !
me who is more miserable and lost than a stray dog !
but after all he did not mean to leave you he is dead
who is dead ?? !
he can 't even destroy himself
who are you speaking of ?
who he is nobody knows !
he is there !
he is damnation and eternal bliss !
he is the greatest man alive !
and he has loved me !
how can this be ?
and now tell me what could force me to betray such a unique man to you miserable creatures !
forgive me miss carozza
UNknown is mere pastime but why not ?
everything today is pastime !
since everything is a pastime doctor i hope you will not hold it against me if we now go over to play poker
your husband has luck in the game !
i have encountered something which until recently i did not believe existed something of greater value and more deeply stirring than even the strongest sensation !
there is no happiness there is only the will for power !
told seems to have almost incredible luck !
shall i give you some evidence of the power of will ?
you cheat !
count told would you not like to confide what happened to you ?
i cheated at cards !
i cheated !
it just came over me !
something stronger than i forced me to do it !
i who usually never touch a card i had such a streak of luck !
i had only to open my cards and i won !
were all your guests old acquaintances ?
all except one whom my wife had invited the psychoanalyst dr mabuse
but he did not join in the game
you cheat !!
don 't you trust any doctor at all ?
some experienced psychiatrist in whom you could confide ?
dr mabuse ?

it is the key to UNknown 's UNknown plant he may have taken refuge there !
take over the bank dr mabuse
the only document to survive from this lost expedition is the diary of the monk UNknown de UNknown
on christmas day UNknown we reached the last pass of the UNknown and for the first time looked down at the legendary jungle
in the morning i read mass then we descended through the clouds
UNknown the wrath of god
a film by werner UNknown
no one can get down that river alive !
i tell you we can do it !
from here it will be easier
our indian slaves are useless
the changing climate kills them off like flies most of them die of colds
we don 't even have time to give them a christian burial
come on move it !
move you pigs !
son of a bitch !
you idiots !
this way !
keep the barrel out of the water !
by the last day of the year we were exhausted
we camped near the river
it can 't go on like this men
the rations are almost finished
the terrain is so difficult we 'r e almost at a UNknown
we cannot hope to reach a UNknown area for some time
in view of the situation we 'r e in
i have changed my plans as follows
UNknown will be built and manned by forty men
these men will have the task to get food and information about hostile indians and the location of el dorado
we have every reason to believe that both are near
the expedition must return within one week by water or by land
if it doesn 't we have to assume it is lost and we have to march back the same way in the hope of reaching an area inhabited by christians
we hope of course that this will not happen as long as the virgin mary is with us
after careful consideration i have decided to make don pedro de UNknown commander of the expedition
his mistress dona inez de UNknown will accompany him
this happens against my better judgement
but she expressed her wish with such grace and UNknown that i cannot refuse it
don UNknown de UNknown will be second in command
a man who is well qualified for this task
his daughter UNknown will stay under his protection this also is against my better judgement
at fifteen she should have stayed in the care of the holy sisters
as on all expeditions the word of god must be brought to the UNknown
i hereby UNknown brother UNknown de UNknown for this task
the remaining two hundred slaves will stay with my group
i declare all this in the form of a document to be submitted for approval to the council of the indies
UNknown i UNknown my signature
four days later on january fourth we set out
may god be with us
watch the raft the rapids get stronger !
keep in the middle of the river !
the first raft got stuck in an eddy !
they must get away from the rocks !
on the other side of the river one of our UNknown ran into an eddy
we could not hear what they were yelling and could not help
how many are on the raft ?
seven and two indians
you are crazy !
i 'm still giving the orders
is that so
further downstream we can cross
once we 'r e on the other side we UNknown l be able to get them out
take as many men as you need and hurry !
i wonder if armando has reached the other side ?
those men must be getting sick
they 'r e still going around in circles
what is this ?
they 'r e trying to signal us
maybe it 's a battle ?
there are only six
i find that strange
i 'm sure there are still some indians in this area
we better go back to the camp
keep your eyes open !
i want to take these men back for a christian burial
you are right my son their souls will rest much better in consecrated ground
it 's the least we can do for these poor guys who died so bravely
if UNknown gets away with this who knows what he UNknown l do next ?
don 't worry about that
we really have other problems
there are indians everywhere
if only we were out of this trouble
we can 't hope for that yet
don 't be afraid
we are not in castile here
look what i UNknown e found for you
this animal sleeps its whole life away
it 's never really awake
our UNknown are gone
when will our misfortunes end ?
if i remove your chains will you run away ?
would you ?
what are you doing with my pot ?
no the wood is too heavy
we UNknown l take this one
i 'm not taking one step further into this jungle
what 's going on ?
we 'r e making nails
what for ?
what are you doing with this log ?
well i 'm carrying it from where i found it back to the camp
who gave that order ?
everyone here is collecting wood
i have no idea
what does it all mean ?
do you know inez ?
don 't even ask
if only it were all over
gentlemen as your commander i have decided to return to our main troop
it 's not my habit to retreat
we have to march back of course because the current is too strong
we need to get back within the time UNknown ordered
but that would be suicide because of the indians
whatever the cost we have to march back
we must get back to UNknown !
shit on UNknown !
and i say we can conquer without UNknown !
that 's what we gathered logs and iron for to build a raft
do you remember UNknown cortez ?
bound for mexico he was ordered to return but he just went on !
silence UNknown !
silence everyone !
be quiet !
stop it now !
what if there are UNknown downstream ?
who cares as long as we get closer to el dorado
have you seen UNknown UNknown his fist ?
he must have something in it
i think they will kill him
would you have the courage to help him ?
you 'r e the only one who can help us
i know he will kill UNknown and armando
he will finish what he has started
you are my last hope
thou UNknown man flow on like a river and thy years know no end
as for man his days are like grass as a flower on the field so he blossoms
for when the wind UNknown over it and it is gone and the place thereof shall know it no more
you know my child for the good of our lord the church was always on the side of the strong
i would like to have you on our side
we need men like you
you should think about it but not too long
well gentlemen we UNknown e gotten rid of the troublemakers
now we need a leader
for me the choice is clear
we should elect the biggest and strongest nobleman we have
what me ?
who else is for him ?
i propose that don UNknown de UNknown remains second in command !
who 's in favor ?
plagues have come over my people UNknown and floods but what the spaniards did to us is much much worse
they gave me the name balthasar but my real name is UNknown UNknown
what does that mean ?
no one was allowed to look directly into my eyes
but now i 'm in chains like my people and i must bow my head
almost everything was taken from us
i can 't do anything i 'm powerless
but i am also sorry for you because i know there is no escape from this jungle
how is UNknown ?
read this document
we the UNknown have until yesterday the seventh day of UNknown regarded ourselves as your servants and subjects
we are now more than 200 miles from your servant UNknown UNknown
fate god 's help and the work of our hands have carried us down a river
a river the natives call UNknown in search of a new land of gold
we have decided to put an end to the UNknown of fate
we are UNknown history and no fruits of this earth shall henceforth be shared
we rebel until death
the house of UNknown is UNknown
and you philip the second are UNknown
by UNknown of this declaration be you UNknown
in your place we proclaim the nobleman from UNknown don fernando de UNknown n as emperor of el dorado
flee from hence o king !
and may god bless your soul
fortune smiles on the brave and spits on the coward
let 's UNknown our ties with spain and crown don fernando de UNknown n
emperor of el dorado
what is a throne but a plank covered with velvet your majesty
he must have dragged himself along
that 's no arrow wound that was a sword thrust
he must have tried to stop him
the man who went on guard at three o UNknown lock was murdered
it was one of his men
while UNknown is alive you UNknown l never be safe !
what can i do about it ?
no killings without a trial
then try him and then kill him !
but it must me a public trial
he still has UNknown
what did you get out of UNknown ?
he must have something in it
we 'd have to chop his hand off to get at it
he said nothing ex UNknown some nonsense
but last night he had visitors
the whole story UNknown of conspiracy
balthasar ask him if it 's true that he received money from UNknown
yes it 's true
next witness !
i was UNknown 's slave
then he gave me away for this expedition because he thought if the indians are scared of a horse they 'd be terrified of a black man
well i don 't know why but sometimes UNknown gave me money
what does the defendant have to say ?
i want to speak
it is only fair to give them money here as well even if they are indians
time will tell that UNknown is right
we understand your confusion my child
you are ex UNknown
my unpleasant duty as president of the first court of your highness don fernando is to sentence pedro de UNknown to death by hanging
i confirm the verdict
i will grant clemency
half of his shares will go to the church the other half will be divided among my best soldiers
UNknown is still alive but he refuses to speak
look a fire !
steer closer to the shore !
load your muskets
be careful men !
strip the negro go on !
fearing an ambush we stripped the negro slave to frighten the indians
get away from the food !
look out for indians !
are you crazy ?
where does this come from ?
and this here ?
the discovery of cannibals around us was so disturbing that we hastily left this dreadful place
the roof UNknown had us build protects us against the UNknown sun
the river is UNknown and we 'r e slowly coming to a halt
what 's this ?
UNknown i know that you plan on doing something to UNknown !
there 's no doubt in my mind
and god will punish you for that !
get out of my way !
are you alright little one ?
what 's happening ?
it 's suddenly so quiet
yes not a sound
the gunpowder !
out of the way !
it 's going to blow up !
grab the pole !
here so he can hold on to it
damned horse nothing but trouble !
what 's wrong with him ?
he 's dead
what are we to aim at ?
just shoot you asshole !
look isn 't that a canoe ?
keep the raft mid stream
it could be a trap
january twenty fourth
they seemed to be trusting
pull the boat close
look there 's a fish !
what did he say ?
he says he 's from the UNknown tribe
he knows from his ancestors that one day the sons of the sun would arrive from afar through great UNknown
the strangers would come with thunder from tubes
they UNknown e waited a long time for the coming of the sons of the sun
for here on this river god never finished his creation
look gold !
ask him where el dorado is
where does this gold come from ?
what did he say ?
has this savage ever heard of our savior jesus christ and of our mission and the true word of god ?
this is a bible
does he understand at all that this book contains the word of god ?
take it in your hand my son
he says it doesn 't talk
kill him for this blasphemy !
it is a tough business
these savages are hard to convert
it won 't be much longer
el dorado might be only a few days away
no more rust on the cannon
we will shoot our enemies with golden bullets
and you UNknown will serve my food on golden UNknown
and all of us will gain something
UNknown provinces and women
let 's not forget the most important part of our mission to spread the word of god to the savages
i 'm sure you 'd like a golden cross UNknown with jewels UNknown instead of the silver one you lost
all the land to our left and all the land to our right now belongs to us
i solemnly and formally take possession of all this land
our country is already six times larger than spain and every day we drift makes it bigger
have you seen any solid ground that would support your weight ?
UNknown it 's missing salt !
fish and fruit we can find now and then but we UNknown e been out of salt for a while
we 'r e down to counting our last grains of corn
hold the horse !
take the reins !
damn get that horse away from me !
get rid of it !
throw that damned beast off the raft !
go on !
it wants to get back on board
go away !
in mexico i saw an army of indians flee at the sight of one single horse
and besides we could have eaten meat for a week
don 't worry little one the horse will be alright
oh my god the emperor !
the emperor is dead !
after our emperor 's death the fate of UNknown was sealed
next morning a few soldiers took him away and he never came back
little mother two by two UNknown the wind on my hair
what are they shouting ?
they 'r e shouting meat is floating by
keep shooting it UNknown l scare them !
don 't go into the jungle !
she has gone without a trace
we couldn 't find her anywhere
we have not seen any indians either
let 's march back to UNknown
two men more or less it won 't matter to him
i am sick of it
i 'm leaving tonight
in the day i will hide
i will get back to UNknown
we followed her tracks half a mile into the jungle then we lost them
she simply vanished !
i 'd rather join the indians than stay with this madman
that man is a head taller than me
that may change
i have counted the river bends
i UNknown e drawn a map in the sand
we need about a day for each bend
one two three four five six seven eight nine
there can be no greater !
whoever even thinks about deserting will be cut into 198 pieces !
and then trampled upon until you can paint the walls with him
whoever eats one grain too many or drinks one dr op of water too much will be locked up for 155 years !
if i UNknown want the birds to drop dead from the trees the birds will drop dead from the trees
i am the wrath of god !
the earth i walk upon sees me and UNknown !
but whoever follows me and the river will win UNknown riches
but whoever deserts
go to mid stream !
hey give me a pole !
watch out the roof !
watch out the sedan chair is falling !
make noise !
i spoke with UNknown
we see nothing but hunger and death
we lose men but we never see the enemy
even el dorado hasn 't been more than an illusion
mexico was no illusion !
if we turn back now others will come
and they will succeed !
and we UNknown l remain a failure !
even if this land only consists of trees and water we will conquer it !
and it UNknown l be milked dry by those who follow us
my men measure riches in gold
it is more
i despise them for it
i am sure UNknown is leading us into destruction
i almost feel he does it deliberately
we can 't even get ashore since the river flooded the jungle for miles
february twenty second
hardly anyone can stand upright
the soldier UNknown gonzales drank my ink thinking it was medicine
i can no longer write
we are drifting in circles
i see a ship with sails in a tall tree and from the stern hangs a canoe
the ship is in your imagination
no UNknown could rise this high
we all have the fever
it is only a mirage
these things happen when people are overly exhausted
shut up monk !
it is real !
no UNknown de UNknown i won 't go with you
we are weak and hungry
that is no ship
these arrows are real take cover !
this arrow can 't harm me
this is not rain
when we reach the sea we will build a bigger ship sail north and take trinidad from the spanish crown
from there we UNknown l sail on and take mexico from cortez
what great treachery this will be !
then all of new spain will be in our hands and we UNknown l stage history like others stage plays
i the wrath of god will marry my own daughter and with her i will found the purest dynasty the earth has ever seen
together we shall rule this entire continent
we will endure
who else is with me ?
i need to know
all right it 's mandatory
you can 't be insured by global without one
yeah now 's not a good time
we 'r e really really super busy
okay this is the third time you UNknown e put this off
what 's up ?
no i just enjoy our morning UNknown
because i don 't want to die
isn 't that the whole point of taking the physical carter ?
no that 's tempting fate
insure a cop today he takes a bullet tomorrow
what are you superstitious ?
it 's not superstition if it 's true
which it is
if you don 't take the physical you don 't have a job
excuse me ?
this was mine
drop UNknown m
if you are a doctor
was a doctor before kevin was born
but i still think i remember where all the main parts are
so drop your pants
breathe into it
carl carlson ?
i 'm gathering
i 'm really sorry
i need sheriff cobb
yeah we established that
i have to get to work
you called 911 to bum a ride ?
it 's a very big day for me
sheriff cobb always used to give me a ride on very big days
driving makes me very nervous
it 's okay carl
it came about rather unexpectedly and i didn 't want to panic you until we had time to process
now i 'm UNknown because this is a UNknown day in my research and i have absolutely no way of getting to work
i 'm sure sheriff carter will be happy to drive you
that was surprisingly easy
he 's on the verge of a major breakthrough
more like a major breakdown
he 's UNknown the field of UNknown UNknown
you would be helping him help everyone else if you do this
what are we waiting for ?
you 'r e making me late
i used to have a real job
you 'r e doing a good thing
next time if you wouldn 't mind cleaning out your car
there won 't be a next time
best of luck
you 'r e not coming to my lab ?
it 's gonna be i got a thing
and then i have another thing
because sheriff cobb always used to
okay for the last time carl
i 'm not sheriff cobb
i 'm an officer of the law and i just can 't
carter ! get enough
it 's remarkable
what is it with you and carter ?
he hasn 't produced anything
he 's literally more trouble than he 's worth
is this really necessary ?
i can 't risk introducing new strains of bacteria into the test area
could you step back please ?
i 'm glad someone 's on that
yes you know when a lizard loses its tail it grows back
it 's called UNknown UNknown
i 'm trying to do the same thing with people
oh that 's cool
moment of truth
if you 'd come to my office for your physical you might not have been hurt physically
well dr blake if you hadn 't tried to give me a physical then i wouldn 't have had to go through such extreme measures to avoid it
you got off lucky carter
well not as lucky as him
however it could be the new UNknown UNknown UNknown
i installed in the UNknown
it could be you know what ?
UNknown UNknown is unstable when heated
and that 's what probably happened
in fact i 'm sure that 's what happened
all mine ?
carl is being fired
what does that UNknown ?
technicians from global UNknown will pack up anything that belongs to dr carlson and confiscate anything that doesn 't
they UNknown l review his personal documents and UNknown any classified information
dr carlson will then be UNknown to make sure he 's not concealing any classified materials
and a global UNknown human UNknown counselor will provide dr carlson with a new r sum
replacing his UNknown at global with a plausible government research project complete with UNknown references
every UNknown of my life has been erased
that 's our goal
i 'm really sorry about this carl
i 'm sure beverly has a place
no she 's not returning my calls
besides i cannot sleep in a public bed
if sheriff cobb were here he 'd let me stay with him
but he 's not here
all my stuff
if i had a phone because i don 't have because they took it !
so i don 't have
can i borrow ?
form 395 UNknown
well so much for your UNknown society
all these UNknown l get filed at the d o d
they 'r e not quite down with the save a tree mentality as of yet
oh and that 's for you
oh yeah it UNknown l hurt a lot more if you try to take it off
what the hell is it ?
wireless body UNknown
it 's taking constant measurements of your vital signs organ functions and blood chemistry
i feel so violated
beverly it 's carl again
please pick up if you 'r e there
i know you told me that with risks come great rewards
well i 'm having a little trouble seeing what those rewards are at this moment
however a new target has been identified
you asked to see me sir ?
thank you sir
just keep the findings between us until i tell you otherwise
on the down low
welcome sheriff carter
organic chemistry 's gonna kill me
what happened to you ?
uh organic chemistry almost killed me
we 'r e gonna have a UNknown tonight so remember to pick up
good going dad
see if i win then he 's going to make me breakfast in bed for a month
and if he wins i wait tables
or lack thereof
lucky person ?
he UNknown l be over just as soon as he finishes off some paperwork
which could take a while
carl where are you ?
w UNknown ?
blew up six years of research
all before lunch
and without it i 'm nothing
oh you 'r e something
you 'r e a nice guy
i irritate you
no no no !
if i get confused i might fall
i don 't think you wanna do this
i get it
and and uh everything sucks
you know go grab a beer
make fun of stark
i UNknown e never grabbed a beer with anybody in my life
today 's the first drink of the rest of your life
if you don 't jump
you think we could be friends ?
i think that 's what the beer is for
what do i do ?
i don 't know what to do
i can 't do it till i get drunk
give me your hand
well your blood pressure UNknown your UNknown went in UNknown and your white cell count suggests you may have broken something
i fell down
where 's carl ?
i thought you were staying on top of him
i have to talk to you
what happened to your head ?
in more ways than one
let me clean that up for you so it doesn 't get infected
do you have a sink ?
sure in the back
oh my god
looks like there was a momentary breach of the UNknown
it UNknown with the accident in dr carlson 's lab
the pulse wave from the UNknown probably caused an UNknown disturbance
that 's not all
and the breach appears to have come from below his lab
in section 5
a hypothetical guy falls maybe 50 feet
lands flat on the ground
and then another guy weighing 180 falls and lands on top of him
okay what is the chance of the hypothetical guy getting up and walking away ?
whether i use single case probability or an application of UNknown statistics the outcome is the same
slim to none
look this hypothetical guy
uh it 's carl carlson
doesn 't make any sense
i gotta find him
there was a fly in my soup
you sensed a fly in your soup
i may have UNknown
that 's why you 'r e out
what number of animal distress calls i UNknown e made to your house ?
i 'd have canned you years ago
yes UNknown you 'r e right
i used to be a man afraid of everything
i 'm really sorry that i couldn 't take your calls
global revoked your therapy privileges
i was a loser
you told me to take risks and you were right
you 'r e touching my skin
kept me from trying the things i wanted to try and doing the things i wanted to do
but something extraordinary happened to me today and all that 's changed
i wanted to say thank you
i UNknown e always wanted to do that
who hasn 't ?
and now beverly if you UNknown l excuse me
good night boys
oh i have been
you 'r e gonna regret it
you and i both know i should UNknown e done that a long time ago
what happened ?
what do you think this is worth ?
spontaneous UNknown UNknown
it could change the entire face of medicine
think how much relief this will give everyone
well except for surgeons
an amazing transformation
he 's the research
i 'd think you 'd be happy
i UNknown l be the first one to jump up and down if he can UNknown the results
but until then he needs to be studied
i think we UNknown e found the source of the exotic particles
there was an UNknown breach of the floor above section 5
which room ?
it 's classified and i 'm not
so unless you wanna up my security clearance
here give it to me
oh that 's not possible
there 's 20 layers of concrete and charged particle barricades surrounding the room
what 's in there that 's so dangerous ?
when i perfect this formula
i can make you invincible
that 's a very generous offer carl but i think i UNknown l have to pass
i 'm not sure that 's a good idea
besides fear 's what keeps you sharp right ?
buy me a beer sometime
tickets to a UNknown something
i UNknown e never been to a UNknown
all that spilled food on the ground UNknown and beer and filth
that 's what used to make my skin crawl when i used to think about it
when you put it like that it 's no wonder
it 's interesting
in a strange way it 's almost appealing
ever since the accident i UNknown e had this bizarre
well in a strange way actually i do
it 's like a light 's been turned on
just came for the patch
your exam 's over
i still say it 's tempting fate
now you can go get your ribs checked out
i think there something 's going on with him
i mean besides the UNknown thing
well he seems to think it 's a good thing
can 't believe i 'm saying this but i think i 'm gonna miss the old carl
and now i 'm gonna have to get your head checked too
he 's not right
that 's better
it 's a a UNknown for a body UNknown UNknown
i think everybody needs one of these
all right i 'm gettin UNknown p
it 's not healing
i don 't understand
i think you might UNknown e
i have to pick up kevin from his friend 's house
i had a purse
you know what ?
and it 's absolutely amazing
you won 't believe what 's going on with carl 's blood work
hey good morning guys
i wear the same thing every day
i found traces of radiation in his white cells and his exotic particle count is off the charts
is there any chance that the explosion could UNknown e caused that radiation to leak from an UNknown lab ?
not that i 'm aware of
well whatever carl was exposed to it 's created a spontaneous genetic UNknown that is UNknown rapidly
we just have to figure out what those UNknown are doing to him
whatever it takes henry
dr carlson here are the UNknown UNknown cells you requested
i asked for UNknown UNknown cells !
the lab tech said that dr carlson attacked him UNknown
i wouldn 't discount it
it didn 't ?
his brain is
now most people use maybe 10 of their brain at any one time
this UNknown has allowed carl to access all 100 of his brain
okay well maybe i 'm only UNknown 5 of mine but that would just make him smarter right ?
like not invincible
UNknown monks have been using meditation to promote healing for centuries
maybe one day man will evolve to the point that he no longer needs doctors
he UNknown l be able to heal himself with thought
but not for thousands of years
tens of thousands even
but into what ?
it appears that you were exposed to something during the explosion that 's altered your brain UNknown
that is why you 'r e able to heal so quickly
so my research is a failure
i didn 't do this
what is it ?
and i 'm starting to sense things
i think you want to study me
the way you want to study that
it 's something that i didn 't create and i can 't control it
it 's okay
and i 'm
which is remarkable
you don 't want to help me
you want me to help you
to get into section 5
i want to do what 's best for you
i do care for you carl
you 'r e a liar
strange kind of radiation ?
how did you know ?
because i was thinking of it ?
loud and clear
so then you know that the only place that can help you is global
i go back there they UNknown l never let me leave
i UNknown l take it from here carter
we 'r e doing just fine thanks
you don 't wanna help me
you want to use me
why would i want to do that ?
because you think i 'm the key
the key to what ?
what is he talking about ?
i have no idea
you are obsessed with this object you know absolutely nothing about
do you ?
i know what to do
get him back to global now !
please let me call in a trauma surgeon
it 's not working
we have to go to section 5 now
you 'r e not authorized
nathan this is ridiculous
there we go
it 's gonna be all right
it UNknown l destroy you
i 'm not afraid
the question is will you be ready ?
because now i 'm having second thoughts
this was your idea
if there 's one thing i UNknown e learned from carl it 's to take some risks
now come on
you will be 100 insured
well without carl around maybe i won 't be needing it
where 'd he get UNknown anyway ?
i don 't know
all right here goes nothing
what made you change your mind ?
well can 't let fear run your life right ?
no we can 't
why do i have to burn my saturday volunteering ?
you 'r e not volunteering
it 's called community service
and you wouldn 't be doing it if you didn 't pull the fire alarm during your i q test
i wouldn 't be doing it if you hadn 't arrested me
you know sometimes it sucks having a dad who 's the town smoke
well sometimes it sucks having a daughter who 's the town delinquent
i take it back
i hate old people
can 't we just discuss this ?
you 'r e going
no need to thank me fargo
you UNknown e earned it
having your own office is a right of passage
it 's a symbol of status and rank
it tells the world you UNknown e arrived
you and your new office
i earned it
it 's a symbol of status and rank
rank 's the word all right
it smells like something died in here
like say the UNknown
it just deserves our respect
the UNknown 's down the hall to the left
been nice doing business with you
check this out !
and we got keys
hey these two match
that was almost exciting
car or no car it is a 30 mile an hour zone
don 't you have anything better to do than UNknown me
what 's going on sheriff ?
i was hoping you could tell me
this sort of thing happen often ?
not to my recollection
it 's some sort of i c b m
i c b m ?
so you guys have seen this before ?
oh i know exactly what it is
you must be zoe
but everyone deserves a second chance right ?
or a third or fourth
let 's put you right to work okay ?
actually doris see i usually ease into my day with a UNknown maybe some sort of pastry
i 'm afraid that three months of saturdays is not gonna work for me
so why don 't we say we UNknown l just get the whole thing over in one fell swoop ?
let 's start with the UNknown room
up and to the side
holy crap !
it 's a nice place to die
even nicer place to live
the residents of eureka give so much
this facility is our way to give back
run out of tennis balls ?
i guess all the UNknown in the world can 't stop you from losing your mind
you UNknown e got a darling sense of humor
UNknown this is zoe
if i desired assistance i 'd be living in an assisted living facility
don 't mind her
do not !
you smoke ?
it 's a popular one
you know probably as popular as UNknown was back in the great depression
for once doris may be right
how 's my hair ?
your hair ?
why are we whispering ?
what matters most is the matter of how we handle UNknown matter
that used to be me
UNknown matter unlike matter
it had to come from somewhere
they 'r e not missiles
what are they nathan ?
and why do they look a lot like missiles ?
we 'r e working on it
so you don 't know ?
he doesn 't know
i have to call this in to the d o d
well i can 't only wait too long and i UNknown l need to have answers
like what are these things that look a lot like missiles but aren 't popping up all over your top secret little town ?
give us a little room people
sir even henry 's a lot smarter and faster than me
fargo that 's the best decision you UNknown e made all day
tell me you know more than that
it 's set to discharge a huge
UNknown particle beam
UNknown uranium UNknown
i searched your entire UNknown
there 's not one single record of UNknown or UNknown UNknown or UNknown particle beams
try death ray ?
did you try turning it off ?
why didn 't i think of that ?
fargo turn the machine off
and that 's a stupid question ?
i mean you did just turn it on right ?
that was an accident
there is no off switch
could you cut the power source ?
and risk there 's a fail safe and it fires immediately ?
i 'm gonna take that as a no
how much time do we have left ?
make emergency UNknown for every location that could be hit
area hospitals should be UNknown for emergency UNknown
and we UNknown l need to estimate collateral damage in and around the target perimeter
we 'r e UNknown
you said death ray
it causes immediate death ?
yes it could cause immediate death
simply blow up and people here would immediately die
it could strike moscow and people there would immediately die
then moscow would UNknown and people everywhere would immediately die
evacuation is UNknown
i 'm not indifferent sheriff
i 'm focused
housing the largest UNknown in the world
UNknown by the smartest scientists in the world
we have plenty of time to figure this out as long as we don 't panic
but we UNknown e downloaded UNknown and UNknown every file every UNknown and every piece of paper of every project ever developed here
and there 's nothing
this is every piece of paper i pulled from fargo 's office
something here has to tell us about that machine
come on !
pardon the UNknown but which would prefer ?
UNknown or progress ?
i don 't know
looks more like someone 's initials
well you are the detective
hand me some UNknown
is that a solar flare ?
that shiny thing is a mirror
you do remember the moon landing right ?
do not tell me that didn 't happen
no it happened but we didn 't go to the moon just to walk
we put mirrors all over the moon to bounce signals back to the earth
UNknown images satellite communications
what like tanks and stuff ?
no cities and stuff
n o r a d took a giant leap for themselves
well with the help from someone at global
someone with the initials i t
UNknown thatcher was this brilliant scientist behind m a d
m a d d ?
mothers against drunk driving ?
UNknown assured destruction
you said he was a brilliant scientist
was or is ?
when a UNknown is UNknown by a UNknown charged particle the result is UNknown
um you lost me right after this is easily explained
your father is a UNknown
your mother is a UNknown
you are a free radical
you 'r e caught stealing UNknown in the mall
you hit your parents with that news
what happens ?
no no no no
i 'm helping people
i see you UNknown e found something to talk about
swing a cat
wait for it
there 's a situation
but there is one guy in town who can
and apparently this is the guy
dr thatcher ?
the question remains UNknown of UNknown ?
you think that 's erie ?
how do you explain UNknown energy UNknown ?
or UNknown among musicians ?
this is the guy
right this way
sir sir !
i 'm henry deacon
of UNknown UNknown
certain aspects of our approach
guys go easy
and easy 's not gonna get it
neither is UNknown the man
just give him a minute
dr thatcher ?
i just can 't figure out how to get to them
these locking bolts they 'r e some kind of UNknown UNknown ?
reverse the UNknown
sheriff at any point when you picked him up the car ride the long walk down here happen to notice this guy 's not all there ?
yeah there may have been signs
righty UNknown lefty UNknown
charlie tango UNknown
don 't give up okay ?
up and down
up and down
were we our kids sent home from school ?
is there gonna be a missile strike ?
do we need to evacuate ?
no reason to panic folks
i heard it was a death ray
that 's ridiculous
started by an idiot
it could also be UNknown UNknown resistance
let me take a look
yeah it looks like they used the classic formula
red for hot blue for not
yellow 's usually the ground
so i guess it 's pretty safe to cut the blue
just give us a hint
that 's great
you don 't know nathan but he will find a way to shut it down
nothing against your husband ex
soon to be ex
we just need to figure out how to get them out of him
i should know but you 'r e not telling me
allison if we don 't stop this thing there won 't be any turf
what is it ?
so this is basically a
UNknown mind UNknown ?
in theory anyway
in memory of UNknown
did he die on this thing ?
what am i looking for again ?
last chance to be a hero doc
you just say the word
worth a shot
UNknown we 'r e gonna go and see that girl of yours
would you like that ?
don 't play coy with me okay ?
i UNknown e been inside that big brain of yours
i know how much you love her
that doesn 't go away does it ?
well i don 't think it does
and i know that when you 'r e not thinking about nuclear UNknown you 'r e thinking about UNknown
that 's what i thought
got you with the nuclear UNknown thing didn 't i ?
i put a trace on the hot wire
the power source leads out the back
that 's where the machine is vulnerable
now if we can reach that then we can get to the guts off the thing
i got a team in section 5 working on a UNknown bombardment drill that will bore right through the UNknown shell
yeah unfortunately your guys in section 4 tell me it 's not UNknown
it 's UNknown UNknown which is
if we tunnel down under and up we UNknown l be directly behind it
and then i think we got a shot
tell fargo to give you anything you need
and not to touch anything you don 't
bad news good news
but carter wasn 't hurt in the process
and the good news ?
here you go buddy
with a room
i don 't know
she 's not to be disturbed
her words not mine
i need to talk to you
is there something i should know ?
it 's really bad isn 't it ?
come on jo talk to us
we all live here
what is the trajectory of the weapon ?
is there a sea based boost phase intercept ?
have the launch UNknown been initiated ?
don 't know
except for that
not that i remember
it never came up okay ?
where is that ?
no the sundial
come on that 's where we find my girl
i thought i was your girl
wait that sounded weird
this UNknown bombardment drill cuts through UNknown like butter
i should be done drilling in what five hours
how 'd you even get here ?
henry UNknown up my chair
i can go 50 miles between charges
so why have i been pushing you around all day ?
i wanted you to feel good about yourself
like you were assisting
dad are you okay ?
why did you do that ?
i 'm not sure
i mean right here
i come here for lunch every day
this is where we first met
we 'd sit and look at the sky
he told me how the stars shined how the planets UNknown around the sun
how his universe UNknown around me
and then his universe came crashing down and mine with it
what happened ?
the nobel prize ?
it was devastating to UNknown
he had a complete mental break the day of the announcement
the day he was going to propose
the day i lost the love of my life
pining over a love that 's gone
it 's not gone
did i say we ?
i mean use explosives to blast through the rest of the bad rock
this machine was UNknown as a second strike dead man 's weapon
any kind of explosion and
i cannot believe we built this thing to protect ourselves
i 'm gonna have to put a call in to the d o d
you can 't
if we start world war ill
allison think about it
we may accidentally blow up
moscow UNknown UNknown and stockholm ?
okay i know how fond you are of stockholm nathan
but this is bigger than you
if you tell them that we can 't stop it they 'r e gonna try and stop it
they UNknown l UNknown us and
and i know any kind of explosion can trigger the device
i get it
beg to differ
it was open
we 'r e gonna party like it 's UNknown
i miss sheriff cobb
do you think this UNknown l work ?
works for me
15 20 UNknown ?
you look the other way and distinguished colleagues
welcome to stockholm
one man never forgot those words
the man we welcome among us today
a man whom nobel committee and the norwegian parliament have selected for this year 's award of the nobel prize
dr UNknown horatio thatcher
a simple little children 's song
but it was this song that inspired my concept of UNknown assured destruction
we build an a bomb they build an a bomb
we build an h bomb they build an h bomb
round and round round and round
the wheels on the bus
leading us towards an unending UNknown of UNknown more powerful more deadly weapons
which is what led me to my greatest achievement
the UNknown particle beam
i built the UNknown weapon in the universe
but that 's the end of the story
let me take you back to the beginning
we don 't have time to go back to UNknown
and UNknown my love without whom this achievement would not have been possible
we have a lot of catching up to do
i don 't like that look
what 's wrong ?
your crew ?
30 seconds and counting guys
how do we stop it ?
you can 't
henry how much time do we have left ?
once it wrap down to its target it cannot be UNknown
henry when you UNknown my jeep did you put in any air bags ?
i got it
carter carter !
so when are you gonna tell him my nobel isn 't his to keep ?
i don 't know
no i earned it
you never know you might need thatcher to UNknown the next ticking time bomb
you remember that feeling ?
it 's nice to know that it lasts a lifetime
you kind of depressing
i said we again didn 't i ?
i UNknown l see you tomorrow carter
old enough to know that is the last thing
i want to hear my 15 year old daughter saying
oh here and now
and this is my daughter zoe
so uh be nice
you know or or maybe a league
you know something very low key
be nice nathan
yeah don 't hold your breath
speaking of which what 's going on with the UNknown missile shield ray ?
i got two teams working on it around the clock
you UNknown l have your UNknown by friday
they want a return
so we 'r e friends now
well i guess that 's a step in the right direction
i 'm not running out to renew our wedding vows or anything
look allison i was thinking
he 's very calm focused
doesn 't seem to be having any side effects from the UNknown um
so kevin is definitely on the drug ?
allison even if i knew i couldn 't tell you
i know it 's just that lately he 's seemed more you know focused
connected to me if that makes any sense
that 's what we 'r e all hoping for
consider yourself kept
try not to commit any UNknown
you get a description of the other vehicle ?
that 's just it
whatever hit her was on foot and according to her invisible
give her a UNknown test ?
yeah she 's clean
it went that way
what else could it be ?
how 'd you get here so fast ?
heard you on my UNknown
and what you were just passing by in full UNknown and night vision goggles ?
is that a body ?
that 's how they feed
instrumental piano music
this is serious
there 's no way an animal did this
he 's probably broken every bone in his body
it 's like he fell out of an airplane
yeah only UNknown
if you buy that hypothesis
yeah i 'm going out on a limb
henry what is this ?
that is a UNknown computer chip
like i used on a black UNknown in the african bush
yeah just like that
that this guy 's either a UNknown at global UNknown
or the research
cell phone ringing
ooh i thought you 'd never ask
listen i wanna play first base
they 'r e always putting me in right field
actually that 's not why i 'm calling
and it might be connected with global UNknown
we found a UNknown computer chip
i haven 't slept in days
my team just can 't keep up
milton 's team is full of section five guys
they have better materials unlimited resources not to mention 160 i q s
competition breeds excellence
yeah tell that to nancy UNknown
you ever want to be considered for section five you gotta be able to compete on their level
talent will only get you so far
comes down to attitude
but what i don 't have is a UNknown UNknown shield ray
you know but at least i 'm punctual
milton 's not late yet
vincent hey dr UNknown
i UNknown e got plenty of time
well in that case let me top you
but you said friday
see what i mean fargo ?
so uh we need to step it up
we need to get serious
but mostly we need to cheat
twice in one day
i think it 's you who 's missing someone
i 'm betting the computer chip means
well let 's hope the autopsy can give us something concrete
stark i want everything packed up and moved back to global UNknown
don 't touch anything
you want to attend to that ?
you are so stuck in right field
i had to tell him carter
this man worked in section five where i 'm the law
so unless you have hard evidence of a crime you can stop what you 'r e doing
just here packing up
it just ends here
be prudent sheriff i wouldn 't want you to end up in federal prison
i like to think we 'r e a little more evolved than that
well you overestimate me
stark 's head UNknown up at global UNknown
when he says jump everyone else says what trajectory ?
yeah well i say screw him
well he 's probably saying the same thing about you
only in latin
i mean there 's no accident
i can 't show evidence of anything
stark took it all
i just did a quick scan while everybody else was distracted
we may not have a body but with a little patience we are gonna have a darn good three UNknown representation
henry i could kiss you
but why don 't we move this to jo 's desk ?
i 'm running a UNknown UNknown
just to sort of fill in the UNknown
how long before we get a full image ?
a few hours maybe less
once i get it back to the garage
i can boost the processing power
back to the woods
i didn 't want to say anything but dr hawthorne wasn 't up to the task so i sent him home
only that in spite of his shortcomings you 'r e going to have a highly sophisticated UNknown UNknown to test tomorrow
a man died milton
so big you want us to stop working ?
i UNknown l keep you UNknown
what 's happened ?
where 's hawthorne ?
we UNknown e only got 26 hours
we need to make every second count
i don 't know
one more dose isn 't going to kill you keller
not taking it might kill your career
it 's your call
exhibits a phenomenon known as chaos
you 'r e not gonna screw with my dad 's credit scores again are you ?
lucky for you i 'm in a forgiving mood
good god it 's UNknown UNknown
well everyone 's got their way of standing out
like yelling UNknown ! in a crowded restaurant
too much ?
i 'm dylan
don 't worry i
it 's a drag when people judge you by what your parents do
your dad 's a total loser too ?
actually he 's a nobel UNknown in chemistry
mom 's a UNknown
and i got a 4 6 UNknown
well that sucks
so i guess you 'r e one of the UNknown huh ?
uh well i do have an UNknown at global UNknown
i hope that doesn 't color your opinion of me
uh it depends
ask a stupid question
fire in the hole !
i can 't hear anything
working on a hunch
yeah well tell me something i don 't know
no he hit the car
what was he going like 500 miles an hour ?
UNknown miles an hour and he UNknown off it which would explain why the car spun out instead of being smashed on impact
here look i UNknown e done numerous UNknown
i UNknown e done biological UNknown
someone or something turned our guy into road runner
could you test for it ?
sure if i had the body
how about a body part ?
oh that 's very good
sometimes when it gets slow yeah
first thing i noticed
he 's been UNknown
i don 't know
could you find this in section five ?
um what signs would i look for ?
besides running at 600 miles an hour ?
appetite extreme thirst
henry you 'r e a rock star
can i borrow your wonder pen ?
to grab a little lunch
okay what is this about carter ?
i wanna know what 's going on with you
you know what 's going on with allison
okay for a cop you 'r e a bad liar
i 'm afraid there may be drugs involved with our john doe 's death
what kind of drugs ?
the kind that can make you run at UNknown 5
you sure you 'r e not on drugs ?
so we 'r e looking for someone who 's hungry
look i 'm not talking about a regular amount of hungry
i 'm talking like post super speedy drug binge hungry
you think global UNknown has a drug problem ?
i think i have a dead UNknown who was UNknown on something
this has to be handled delicately
UNknown pen whirring
son of a bitch
well then i UNknown l make it easy on you
have these guys submit to a drug test
do you have evidence that they 'r e taking something illegal ?
well illegal no
how do you know anybody else is taking it ?
oh i have my reasons
i 'm listening
your UNknown evidence is a healthy appetite ?
well when you put it like that it just sounds dumb
that more what you had in mind ?
i want them UNknown and isolated for investigation
this is still an internal matter sheriff
not anymore nathan
give it to me
that 's evidence in an UNknown investigation
carter is right
i UNknown l have henry analyze this
uh we can interrogate milton 's team tomorrow
well why not now ?
i want to let them stew
any drug that gets people this UNknown has got to have a nasty rebound
fine well we can put them in the UNknown chamber in section four
i mean who needs this kind of pressure ?
when do kids just get to be kids ?
actually i made a friend
that 's great !
he even has a student UNknown at global d
since when do you like guys who are normal and smart ?
since they look like him
uh s a r a h we need to um talk about increasing security
i mean it 's a nice hole
it 's very uh very UNknown UNknown
dad this is dylan
it 's not your intentions i 'm worried about
dylan 's my chemistry tutor
just helping her get a head start you know ?
you need all the help you can around here believe me
famous parents UNknown he has issues
don 't we all ?
don 't you have work to do ?
yeah i heard about that accident
did you figure out what caused it yet ?
yeah as a matter of fact
i 'm this close
i have a gun
still working on the who but i need a chemical analysis so uh give me a call when you get in
what was that ?
i almost feel sorry for them
well he 's almost ready
and you 'r e sure they were here all night ?
yeah they UNknown e been under constant surveillance
well someone UNknown my place last night
someone moving too fast for my security camera
if it wasn 't one of them they definitely know who it was
maybe you should question them at some point
do i tell you how to do your job ?
no but that is an amusing idea
i UNknown l question them when they 'r e good and ready
let me out of here !
you can 't keep me locked up like this
let me out !
i 'm not gonna ask you misleading clever questions
not gonna try to trap you all right ?
you work in section five
i figured you 'r e too smart for that
and watch you slowly go into withdrawal
until every nerve in your body is on fire
until your skin 's crawling and your brain is begging for whatever the hell you took
see i got a body pumped full of just god knows what and everything points to you
i didn 't kill him
i didn 't know anybody would get hurt
who else is involved ?
wasn 't what milton ?
forcing his nerve system to shut down
can you UNknown it ?
not without knowing exactly what he was taking
what is he saying ?
i don 't know
it 's an advanced form of UNknown
that 's the drug they 'r e using on kevin in the study
they must have altered it in the lab
changed the chemical composition
um i can access the personnel files
but it UNknown l be a long list
UNknown kids their parents UNknown student UNknown
that 's my daughter 's boyfriend
son of a bitch was hiding in plain sight
allison what is it ?
okay jo you go to the kid 's house
i 'm hitting the school
jo all right
now you UNknown e given him a drug that has killed a man
the drug didn 't kill him
cooking it in the lab did
and i didn 't give kevin anything
oh oh great now you 'r e gonna try to lay the blame on someone else ?
no i 'm telling you that kevin isn 't on the drug
he 's receiving the UNknown
how could you know that ?
it 's a double blind study
because i cheated
no you that can 't
because you 'r e different
any progress that kevin has made ?
it 's because of his relationship with you
not because of any drug
and you UNknown e known about this all this time ?
i 'm sorry i couldn 't tell you
don 't lie to me again
it was one kiss during UNknown
right now i need to know where dylan is
okay i don 't know
i 'm not his keeper
all right come with me
i 'm telling you he 's using drugs
oh of course you think the guy i like must be using drugs
he had access to the lab and he was in our house
last night when it was UNknown
what do you think
this drug UNknown uh he cooks it into speed
do you realize how crazy you sound ?
nobody can move that fast
you had to keep pushing
everybody 's always pushing all the time
dylan where 's zoe ?
you don 't know what it 's like !
i know what it 's like to be pulled from a moving vehicle
where 's my daughter ?
i cooked the UNknown so that i could keep up
they came to me
they said that if i helped them that they would help me
do you have any idea how hard that i worked for that ?
dylan you gotta trust me
no i told hawthorne to watch the UNknown
or more stupid
you gotta listen to me
and don 't tell me what to do
okay you gotta stop doing that
why so i can go to jail for the rest of my life ?
damn straight !
it doesn 't have to end like this
i can 't go to jail
dylan don 't
yeah are you ?
this is dr stark
that 's right
but the important thing is people are making an effort
an effort ?
well it 's a beautiful day here at UNknown field
crowd the plate law dog
i UNknown l nail ya
aw just throw the damn ball UNknown
let a pro show you how it 's done
old enough to know that is the last thing
i want to hear my 15 year old daughter saying
oh here and now
and this is my daughter zoe
so uh be nice
you know or or maybe a league
you know something very low key
be nice nathan

well it 's a beautiful day here at UNknown field
crowd the plate law dog
i UNknown l nail ya
aw just throw the damn ball UNknown
let a pro show you how it 's done
the UNknown earth

well because he was convinced that there was a buried treasure and he could not rest until he found it

if a land does not bear fruit it is because it is damned
they managed to put out the flames and in UNknown a chapel was built
but ever since no grass no tree has grown on the devil 's field
and whatever happens there you make the sign of the cross
as to johannes you are too ambitious to be a peasant
stay on the farm and get married with maria
why do the village dogs howl so ?
it 's the death that happens
to find the secret my descendants will have to UNknown the ground without cease until they discover the treasure of devil 's field and then take advantage of its riches

aren 't you ashamed to trick her out of the land where she was born ?
i have breathed the beau UNknown 's air
i cannot live like a peasant in those places where i drown at those tiny man to man houses that are like his own cattle
do i hook up the UNknown horse or the bay ?

the people are assembled
brother i am not worthy of the hand that you offer me
forgive me peter i UNknown e offended you
i have offended you and the country where i was born
forgive me maria !
forgive me my sins !
i have offended you because i wanted to be superior to you !
did you know that i would return to the house today ?
we have waited for you every day
your room has always been prepared
it 's disgusting appalling !
you do not know !
for you it 's a game UNknown what else life offers you willingly
but to me !
i beg you quiet !
the guardians of order are on watch and full of ambition
behind the doors the bribed servants are lurking
in the gardens UNknown are hiding
you exaggerate my friend
the fact that we are not satisfied with peasant girls and maidens with merchants daughters and UNknown that we choose the finest and prettiest is a proof of our taste
what was the UNknown you gave us some weeks ago ?
beauty be prey of the strong
all splendour of the world UNknown to the power of mind
and the conqueror 's glory shine brighter
and penetrate deeper more painfully into the souls
than the brilliance which merely UNknown the eye
it 's true !
you even avoid us !
none of the UNknown festivities has welcomed you !
just because a few fathers wring their hands and a few mothers cry heart UNknown !
just don 't think the beauties themselves are angry with us
yesterday UNknown the little UNknown you should have seen her face !
and the amazing daughter of UNknown the poet really she was lovely !
we snatch them from their lovers arms heavy with everyday burdens !
the misunderstood woman UNknown not for the husband inexperienced in love !
out of cramped rooms into wide mystic spaces
all fairy tales come to life all dreams of secret nights
dreams of the orient they come true !
what no one admits and everyone longs for suddenly is reality !
quite so quite so
you always only speak about yourself who are good looking and endowed with charm and you forget me the cripple
lf he came to the festivities as you demand he would spoil them and instead of lust horror would UNknown its way
my friend it seems to me that you UNknown enormously the way women feel about beauty
there were spring nights
all UNknown magic scent of flowers heavy and UNknown
and i had to leave tossed by a fever out into lonely lanes
and i searched for a strumpet a really depraved one
spoke to her offered her gold a lot of gold still i felt like the beggar asking for alms
by the light of the street lamp she looked me up and down with eyes a smile so humiliating that my blood ran cold
there the gold had an effect !
on coloured lips its blaze reflected my misery 's dreadful need
UNknown words promised agreement but i didn 't have the strength to spit at myself and to UNknown the spring night
my lord the notary
what 's the notary supposed to do ?
don 't worry !
what for ?
i forgot to confide it to you
you don 't know what you 'r e doing !
your life 's work !
you spent half your fortune on it ; you wasted it UNknown
tomorrow evening after dusk in the presence of the senate and the UNknown
i UNknown l officially announce it to the people
gentlemen you are invited
i considered everything
the access to the underground hall
lf you fear discovery avoid it from now on
but excuse me now
i must lay down the UNknown and articles of the donation
i came past the town hall when the city elders drove up in their UNknown for some UNknown
maybe there is what do you think
ln one of them listen
my greetings gentlemen and thanks that my modest home has been honoured by such distinguished guests
your modest home ?
the splendour of the rooms we walked through is UNknown in all of genoa
your compliment makes me happy
but please permit here are my friends the best of genoa 's aristocracy
you will recognize the names of illustrious UNknown
this is my only child my beloved daughter carlotta
i am afraid sir maybe you find her too liberal minded
she has to my regret a low opinion of social rules
the admiration of your generosity and a very special request to you she
i bid you welcome and if i had the privilege to fulfil the young lady 's desire
i would call myself lucky !
but now if you allow we UNknown from the senate want to bring to you the gratitude and the joyful UNknown of the noble assembly
your document announces a donation to us so great and important so unexpected and seldom these days
it 's hard for the citizen to preserve his UNknown possessions
gold he UNknown worked for runs through his fingers like water and yet taxes increase even more
we endured it mostly patiently and grumbling but rarely since the treasure of our family 's sanctity remained to us and the belief in our madonna
but there it breaks in like a wolf into the flock and robs us of our wives and UNknown our daughters and without defence without help
but forgive me sir to complain to you about our sorrows was really not our delegation 's intention
for the first ray of light after scared days we have to thank you !
the island 's auspicious name for us it UNknown well
do you remember signorina a rider this morning his black horse took fright at the sight of the UNknown
the duke UNknown right of objection we 'r e dependent
what could he object
a glance from my eyes isn 't it worth it for you ?
i 'd gladly give my life for you yet
and if this were just what i wanted ?
you are so great so mighty and strong so far above me
i have to stretch myself
look just to look into your eyes oh so sure of victory
and i 'd like to see you small and low and poor far beneath me UNknown to my feet
the dead are poor
lf you 'r e dead one day what use is my love to you then ?
have you gone mad young lady !
wait UNknown !
he is to hand us over to those lousy citizens !
the access to the underground hall !
let me go !
but you one word !
i know nothing
do you hear ?
that 's settled then you UNknown l give us one more day
the senate will request the duke 's permission first
and tonight you will be my guest
as now you are mine
i beg my noble guests not to disdain my invitation just a simple meal
signorina your arm !
sir UNknown really
i was scared ; suddenly you reached for your heart
and went pale
but did my father not tell you about a request ?
yet i rarely have the pleasure to associate with pretty women that 's why that do you understand ?
i do paintings
and you can ?
i don 't know whether i can and if i fail then it seems to me it 's not always my fault
you hardly find models
the picture appeared so UNknown fine
just an ugly shadow between chin and mouth
look there and ponder and try as i would it appeared again and again
already i thought it gone and banished for ever
there all of a sudden UNknown it crept out of the brushes and took root !
this picture i gave up
a long time i didn 't attempt anything
i see !
but just now i UNknown e seen it the same look
oh goodness collect yourself !
you do me wrong
there i have a cottage for a studio
early in the morning the lanes and squares still deserted and empty when the wan morning light is lapping around the canvas UNknown and soft
then to me it seems the right time for work
a road goes past my cottage
lined by tall UNknown
shy and bowed down lost in thought
suddenly UNknown watching the windows whose curtains hide the observer
but you did not see her
then arose purple glowing veils shimmering in a thousand UNknown shining UNknown
like eerie UNknown came along announcing its approach the sun
and a second miracle took place
i saw the small wretched wanderer raise his head
every muscle UNknown up in the frail body
the arms raised up into the sky
thus he walked into the glare towards the sun
and i saw him becoming taller and taller the figure was growing enormously
my heart was beating
thus i was painting your figure walking towards the sun
but still i need the face and still i need the drunken eye
in which all beauty will be reflected
i am ashamed
i have never felt like this in my life !
will you come to my studio so that i can complete the painting ?
i UNknown l be glad to come
he 's playing cat and mouse with us
he has become far too mighty the noble sir !
his last triumph over UNknown went to his head
the people have spoilt him
after all they are indebted to him
they pay him
how are things going ?
he didn 't say
his heart would beat for the people would decide in its favour
but fairness and consideration for his friends would call him for caution he ought to think it over and discuss it and similar UNknown
with all his heart he UNknown us the donation
he UNknown the whole affair
the man of the day is UNknown UNknown !
the whole town is praising his name
my daughter carlotta who is not easily conquered spoke of him often imagining his character
now he has taken her by storm
duke UNknown ought to be wary !
he ought to be wary
duke UNknown !
this is the public mood
does the mob frighten you ?
you spoke differently yesterday
do you speak to your friend like this ?
ls your mockery supposed to turn a knife in my wounds and my friends laughter to drive me mad ?
what ails you UNknown ?
i do not recognize you
the most brilliant gentleman of my court
like nobody else honoured beloved UNknown by the women constantly in the mood for the most incredible pranks
there are people who only see the light and darkness is alien to them
i was one of that kind
life seemed to me a source of constant joy from which i drank with thirsty UNknown careless without thinking
when i stretched out my hand i held the rose drew in its fragrance and pulled the petals off
when i dropped to the ground i fell softly on moss thorns UNknown me as well as sharp stones
when a friend poured out his heart to me
i heard him perfectly well but i did not understand him
and now i have experienced at once all torment of hell humiliation and disgrace
a bourgeois child
i think i did not understand her right
she asked for a sacrifice as a pledge of my love
but what she desired a lot of nonsense madness born at that moment i tried to understand to interpret following the rules of UNknown manners
after a night of battling i thought i 'd found it and mounted my horse free and proud like a god my filled heart puffed up with noble feelings
and i rode through the town and lost in dreams i drew up the courting and i saw the beauty flush happily stunned and moved by the honour !
a count UNknown UNknown UNknown offers heart and hand
you are really mad
the strange look in her eyes her cool and amazed smile confused me
but to guard timid heart
i behaved UNknown arrogant and UNknown
i talked about the sacrifice i would make for her more evil than self UNknown and death
and since i finally got her no
i completely lost the UNknown of my senses
i threw myself at her feet about my possessions
i wildly talked gibberish
UNknown pull yourself together
who is this woman ?
the UNknown 's daughter carlotta
i 'd like to warn you for some reasons but i know the UNknown of such an action and how he who warns is UNknown by him who loves unfortunately
that 's why i prefer helping you instead of giving advice to you
ah if you could
you don 't know this woman
but i know women
i want to forget her
but first she has to be mine
we are bound by law and order
like everybody else
pass into the town 's possession
damn it what has UNknown what has the island to do with your UNknown intrigues ?
on that island an artificial grotto makes wonderful rooms UNknown especially created for love 's UNknown
when you enter the grotto a blue light UNknown your eyes
heavy UNknown confuse your senses crimson flames UNknown up like visions distant music and soft singing
lure you deeper and deeper
a narrow path leads to the cave 's entrance hidden by UNknown of roses
but if someone discovers the grotto 's secret then we are lost
does UNknown know about your doing ?
UNknown ha ha !
genoa 's ugliest man is the creator of this adventure
of this UNknown idea of beauty
and he himself
the torches glow UNknown everything
ln the orgy 's frenzy ugliness becomes beautiful and beauty becomes ugly
the UNknown vanish in the rapture !
and this fool UNknown after he cultivated on his land blooms of vice and poisonous plants of sin he gives up the land and himself and you ?
he warned us
that is my curse your UNknown
your UNknown passion UNknown me to actions i condemn !
i will rescue what can still be rescued
i will keep my promise to you because your love keeps you from the company of UNknown and because of our friendship since youth
beware UNknown you have been warned of violence
UNknown ought to restrain his urge for donation for a long time
this benefactor of people he will obey or woe to him and woe to you all !
our times are full of strange things
i knew a woman like me she learned to paint at the UNknown school she painted hands
fine slim hands with delicate blue UNknown UNknown rough and strong fists of men
a woman 's hand with rings UNknown and tender with nails pointed and rosy flashing like drops of pale blood
there i saw a hand which dug its nails in healthy flesh and another plucked with gentle fingers a twig growing out of green bushes
but the UNknown thing was one painting
a hand UNknown and pale pale as death with weird long and skinny fingers it was UNknown something you could not see
only a faint UNknown gleam penetrated the eerie fingers but this glow was like a silent UNknown
like a suppressed moaning cry
like a scream restrained and in mortal fear
like a restrained cry for release
but the painting 's meaning ?
the poor one probably never felt what inspires artists to great works the happiness of love or the ardent desire for it
she may have been anxious that once on her path of life she might encounter an event some UNknown intoxicating charm to which she would surrender
how strange fear of happiness ?
the driving force of this poor life was greed for fame and the fountain from which it was UNknown was pain
not mentally a physical pain
your hand signorina is not as steady as your voice if you want to paint
my friend suffered from her heart since her youth
she painted and her pain too
even though you deny it you are deeply moved so it really touched you ?
i loved her
tell me of your youth or why you are so gloomy and in such a bad mood today or rather why your eyes so UNknown evade mine
what have i done ?
are you angry with me ?
i implore you don 't be angry with me !
just have some patience with me !
i don 't understand it is like a dream and i fear
no do not fear !
you are a man and totally without any self confidence
ls it so unthinkable that a woman should find herself in love and friendship for you ?
ha ha !
i do not say it is
should there be on this earth among millions of beating hearts not to be found one that UNknown for you in love ?
for me me who hates himself who UNknown from himself who banished the mirrors out of his rooms !
a fool you are !
the leaves wither and fall
and this should be the one thing ?
did you never go out on a sunny day gloomy and sad without knowing why ?
and not even the most outstanding person not the most UNknown tree could rescue you from your anxiety
but i notice one thing
you evade me once with looks now with words
but i have to tell you
there take my hands kiss them quickly !
but let me go on working
i need your eyes for my painting
thus they are right for me
just look at me just straight
look deeply into my eyes and think about beautiful things that i am your sun that chases away all darkness from your life with streaming light
for god 's sake carlotta i must at your feet
i am happy beyond words
i beg you stay
see how calmly i say the word which tormented you for so long
now it 's over
because i am quite a fragile toy
now come and hold me
i am exhausted yet you must
for all saints sake
you sweet poor one
i want to UNknown to you all i have
i want to spread myself out beneath your feet
i want to be infinitely good to you and tender
please tell him to wait
since yesterday i have been hearing voices everywhere
singing in the air and murmuring in the bushes
carlotta 's silvery laugh a while ago but probably it was a delusion
ah sir how changed and happy i am since the day you first entered my house
your daughter so soon to be my wife how beautiful beyond words she is so full of sincere kindness
but you are reserved
i am bewildered and dazzled
what you have just shown me it is incredible that the brain of a single man should have thought up this realm of magic !
many people helped me
but where is carlotta ?
come on let us look for her
did you not hear ?
they are looking for you carlotta and you hide yourself in the shadows
then you run away from your UNknown ?
don 't think badly of me duke
after all i don 't know what happens to me
yesterday when i answered you no for count UNknown
i felt proud and secure grand and joyful
but yet since i finished the painting which pleased you so much the portrait of UNknown
it seems to me as if something had grown weary within me as if my love were no longer the same
not poorer don 't get me wrong
but as though now he had given me his all his everything and as though i had nothing nothing more to expect
and further yet i don 't know if a woman 's UNknown feelings are of interest to you or whether they provoke your scorn duke ?
pray trust me how true and authentic you are
as if i had drunk wine heavy and mixed with enchanting herbs or that strange drink UNknown with the blood from the heart of a love stricken virgin !
it is the dreadful spell of beauty normally bound half concealed from the senses and now raging exposed to the daylight and UNknown eyes
like a beautiful woman 's limbs UNknown covered in the years of desire suddenly enjoying UNknown UNknown its charms for the rejoicing eyes of the loving youth !
in a bed of the loveliest flowers
you were to find a grim monster
for god 's sake young lady
let me go duke !
calm down then ; the sole joyful hour you said it yourself he owes to you
this may console you
i do not want any mercy
torture and hatred i do deserve desperation and death !
so listen to one last thing
he was not worthy and did not deserve your love
he is not the noble man you think he is
he is obsessed by evil desire and today it UNknown him
i won 't hear anything
you try to UNknown him but he is noble and sublime and i am miserable and depraved
i hate myself and the world and you
only the night this very night i love and its shadows
then god may have mercy upon you
go go !
ah what a night !
what a glowing summer night !
i want to crawl into its dark light dive into its shining darkness !
with stars i UNknown l dance the summer night 's dance but with goblins i UNknown l sleep in the bushes
ah what a night !
what a glowing summer night !
ah what a night !
what a glowing summer night !
with stars i UNknown l dance the summer night 's dance but with goblins i UNknown l sleep in the bushes
ah what a night !
what a glowing summer night !
where is my bride ?
has no one seen carlotta ?
why are you fleeing from me ?
no i am not fleeing from you
you know me then ?
i don 't know who you are
but if it were someone who loves you beauty ?
you love me ?
are you UNknown ?
o beautiful carlotta how strangely you speak !
strangely my love ?
do you feel my heart beating passionately !
for you my dear !
for you !
come on my dear !
come on let us hurry !
sweet is the night the night is short dawn is close !
feel my heart beating
for you !
it UNknown to me from heights and UNknown a thousand times !
singing from the air a mocking song from the depths of hell !
her figure dances before me peers out of bushes here and there her dress UNknown
like a will o the wisp she rushes me uphill downhill into the air into the swamps and yet i held her after all she was mine !
or was she not ?
UNknown UNknown UNknown !
bearer of beauty !
what do you want ?
be silent !
a fool a cripple !
a beggar a monster !
where is my bride ?
bring her to me !
i will be grateful
then i will be prince king god !
but give me carlotta !
i will be grateful !
then i will be prince king god !
UNknown UNknown apollo !
this people 's friend
cheers for UNknown !
stop it people of genoa !
stop it UNknown people !
UNknown you are !
what is this ?
the council of eight !
i see !
these envious persons !
through the holy council of eight i duke UNknown the people 's protector and loyal friend bring a charge against the knight UNknown UNknown
i accuse him of kidnapping girls of UNknown and rape committed against virgins of UNknown
and encouragement to the same
was there not a scream ?
did you not hear a scream ?
it shall be devastated by fire as a breeding ground of vices and devilish sin
sir UNknown you
they rob us !
cursed thieves !
kill the bastards !
defend yourself !
UNknown speak !
UNknown flutes UNknown and wild singing ?
you see he is obsessed the demon speaks through him !
UNknown listen it 's a matter of life and death
defend yourself !
lead him away !
him who is silent we trust more than you who speak
he did us good
UNknown UNknown !
speak frankly and without reserve UNknown UNknown
where were you hidden before you fled to duke UNknown seeking help ?
ln the house of UNknown UNknown
why don 't you move ?
old man have mercy and let me go !
i begin to realize terribly clearly
speak frankly and without reserve signorina UNknown
who robbed you of freedom and honour ?
a nobleman who called himself UNknown UNknown
spit out the truth !
old man she is in danger i see the UNknown before me !
the head of this gang of wild fellows of noble robbers is UNknown UNknown
all this was brought before the duke by count UNknown UNknown
who spoke the name ?
who snatched it from my brain ?
it 's him !
are you raving ?
who talks about UNknown ?
who is she ?
come on i UNknown l lead you
do you see the blue light up there ?
do you hear ?
wild and UNknown screams and rejoicing
people of genoa !
to my poor lost bride !
then i UNknown l justify myself to you and you shall judge
but woe to the others !
and see for me it meant so much
i had nothing else
realize if you say to me
i kidnapped her i took her by force
but if you say to me
she gave herself to me
she carlotta willingly in love
and she was happy yes precisely you said happy
then then then i had nothing well then you took nothing from me then i am once again as miserable just as miserable as i was
thrown back into UNknown
i know nothing else to tell you
only one thing
UNknown according to your saying once
beauty be prey of the strong
you fancied yourself strong for one hour but you were not
pleasure presented itself to you there you avoided it trembling and cowardly
you only saw the darkness the shadows danger and sin
too bitterly branded for life you became by fate broken winged UNknown self conscious
carlotta also give herself to you ?
why did you not take her ?
i reveal for all the world to see a crime so ghastly
because i look into depths you can 't even imagine since i am a man and you ?
i don 't know which one of us is looking deeper
your words meaning but this is not possible
her lips asked for mercy UNknown they UNknown the old song of fearful resistance
but her eyes begged for lust
an UNknown confession escaped from her lips fear and horror
but from her eyes boundless wild sparks of UNknown desire were flashing
at last it forced its way greater than you she made herself free
the sparkling dance of her laughing eyes was joined by the UNknown song of her lips
grant death her eyes UNknown
grant happiness UNknown her speech
my most UNknown hour no one can take it away from me !
then say a prayer !
you 'r e unable to get at me what do you want ?
at a parish fair a UNknown fiddler stroke up a graceful tune
the most beautiful one of the beauties was his love
i picked her out of the dancing crowd and took her away
he rushed after me he stood before me like this one his features UNknown UNknown and full of hate !
with his fiddle i killed him
come on then with my hands i shall strangle all of you !
then die scoundrel !
was it not my love ?
no no look at me UNknown
away away !
and the red light !
woe woe !
i want UNknown ere i die
i want i want
at last i must go to the parish fair
and my cap my nice cap
red with silver bells
there is someone lying there
good people there lies a dead man
who killed brother zhang ?
the masked UNknown
we UNknown e spent over half a year 's time but still can 't find anything about them
brother zhang have you heard anything ?
he found out that they are based in UNknown town
UNknown town ?
they work under a chief and wear masks when they 'r e killing
the chief 's mask is golden and uses a golden trident
chicken blood ?
du gang you always claim to be brave what 's the matter with you now ?
you thieves raided on me and killed my family of twenty eight
as long as there 's one of us left he will kill you all for revenge
wait a minute i know that your family has twenty nine people in total why did you say twenty eight ?
did your brother du UNknown get away ?
he UNknown l come back and revenge for you ?
that 's right
let me be clear ;
we were paid by your enemies to get rid of the twenty nine of you
i could use it all now
alright everyone got your share
let 's do our job
let 's get rid of the du family !
your whole family 's dead
there 's no hope left and you can die now
i can never die in peace
that 's what i 'm hoping for
chief UNknown town
UNknown town ?
he 's from a well known family there we could find him and investigate
ling UNknown ?
there 's someone here who would like to see the master
his name is zeng jun
send him in i UNknown l go outside to greet him
we 'r e all paying customers here how could you ?
they all have some UNknown
i just worry about your inconvenience
ling UNknown is a rich man why don 't we stay at his residence ?
there aren 't that many martial arts experts here since we know that the masked UNknown are based here
i get it you suspect ling UNknown to be the chief
watch it !
i didn 't say that
welcome to our small town !
but why would you be staying at such a lowly inn ?
come stay at my place there 's plenty of guest rooms
brother ling did zeng jun tell you why we 'r e here ?
they are very secretive and come and go like ghosts
we need to take our time in this investigation
you 'r e from a prominent family
i 'm afraid it 'd be a bother if we stay with you
i think we better put up in an inn
don 't listen to UNknown UNknown follow me
we UNknown e already lost several men dealing with the masked UNknown
we must be extra careful
we UNknown e all taken oaths before no one would act alone
very well i 'm the host
maybe we could sit down and have a chat ?
i UNknown e introduced them to you briefly but
i 'm not sure whether you can remember so many of us
you know of UNknown 's long family and UNknown 's han family ?
these are two of the long brothers
long UNknown long UNknown
i 'm sure they can tell you the details
it happened about a month ago
my family and the han family had a wedding to plan
my eldest brother UNknown and my fifth brother UNknown escorted 4th sister UNknown to be married to UNknown
they were besieged by masked UNknown outside the town
as we rushed there eldest brother was about to die
they took UNknown and UNknown with them
a friend zhang cheng found out of the masked UNknown being based in UNknown town
unfortunately he had sustained serious injuries and died before he could tell us more
you brought us the heated wine why are you still here ?
leave now we UNknown e business to discuss here
the cook is a bit strange not sure what he 's up to
come on let 's eat
i 'm sure he 's up to something
UNknown pushed him just now it looked as if he fell
in fact he pretended to fall he wasn 't being pushed down
if that 's the case we must keep an eye on him
strange indeed he looks very familiar
brother ling let me drink to you again
i can 't drink anymore
i think i should sleep here tonight
master this isn 't a place to sleep
i like to sleep wherever i please
it 's not your call
why do you think ling UNknown 's staying here tonight ?
he likes to be pampered and is very particular about his meals and lodgings
why would he be interested to sleep in this dump ?
and it didn 't seem like he 's drunk
surely something 's up
watch out for anything out of the ordinary
fang ying since ling UNknown 's staying here sneak in his house and take a look
see if you could find anything
write properly pay more attention
zhao UNknown sun li
UNknown shen han yang ; zhu qin you xu
why aren 't you writing ?
where are you going ?
i 'm thirsty i want water
very well i UNknown l go with you
get up !
looks like you UNknown e taken some lessons
but i 'd really like to find out how good you are
what are you two doing here ?
thirsty just want some water
what was that move when you were dodging UNknown ?
i have no idea
sorry to disturb your sleep
it 's better to be awake
there 's nothing strange about the ling residence
i was attacked by the chief
golden mask golden trident none of the ling family members knew
go upstairs and check whether ling UNknown is asleep
slowly don 't make a sound
checking on ling UNknown ?
what happened ?
shut up !
see if you know any of them
and where 's ling UNknown ?
he 's been sleeping there the whole evening
guess he 's got nothing to do with the masked UNknown
take the bodies out
zeng jun and the others killed them
do you know this person ?
there 's one in UNknown town
his name is fang UNknown ; a very skilled chap
but then everyone knows of us as foes
this might sound like i 'm trying to frame him
please could you just tell us more
fang UNknown likes to help others from time to time but he does things according to his moods
he has a lot of martial arts experts working for him
and to prevent others from finding out their base it must be set in some big house
other than my residence the fang residence is the biggest here
going to the market ?
in order to find the butcher the UNknown must take its chances
not afraid to die ?
looking for the butcher is risky
tell me how a UNknown can find the butcher
the butcher looking for me and i searching the butcher
i 'm going to the market wanna come along ?
UNknown fish head a platter of UNknown and this
light the fire
if i can why can 't you ?
we see each other everyday
i still don 't know your name
just consider me as a nobody
i 'm zeng jun
you think ?
what 's the fun to be a cook ?
beware being burnt to death without the fire being lit
you 'r e saying that the masked UNknown will kill us ?
though i don 't know how to light a fire i can cook
you want to be a UNknown man ?
who doesn 't ?
even so it 's better than trying to evade
why can 't you leave me alone like the rest of them ?
i want to help you
very well light the fire
i don 't believe you 'r e cold blooded
i think you don 't believe that yourself
ling UNknown said you seem familiar
a man must be upright
if you evade you might as well be dead
what are you hiding from ?
light the fire
take a look
what are you looking at ?
eat up !
where 's UNknown and the rest ?
why aren 't they back ?
they 'r e keeping an eye on fang UNknown at the teahouse
chen UNknown and UNknown are outside
i guess fang UNknown hasn 't left hence neither could they
yang UNknown must be eating with brother xu right now
so what ?
come on !
they killed yang UNknown he was killed by a chief who used golden trident
what are you doing here ?
get out !
what are you talking about ?
liang UNknown don 't be mad
what he just said wasn 't what you think he meant
what does he mean then ?
enough come over
fang UNknown isn 't the chief
when yang UNknown was killed we were in the teahouse
fang UNknown isn 't the chief and neither is ling UNknown
then who is ?
neither of them is and it could also be said they could both be
we only know that they have a chief but there could be more than one
we kept an eye on one while the other 's free to kill
that 's why ling UNknown and fang UNknown they both could be
what are we waiting for ?
let 's invite both ling UNknown and fang UNknown and see what happens
zeng jun 's with me
the rest will keep an eye outside the ling residence
if fang UNknown leaves
that 's very smart of you to hide here
but then we could still find you
what are you two talking about ?
you just came from a temple fair ?
i didn 't know there 's one
you can act
you have something to say ?
you saw them ?
you 'r e on our side only that you use a different plan
you plan to UNknown them ?
but the mask and the trident is that of a chief
you can 't handle the whole organization by yourself
how about ?
i should slap you for saying that
i take you as a friend and you treat yourself as an ass
sorry maybe i was out of line
maybe you don 't want to mix with us
let me tell you now my name is gao yao
master fang 's here
why not ?
i UNknown e two friends who 'd like to see you
must have been a tough journey here
and i think you UNknown e followed me on the streets before
as for brother UNknown
we 'r e here to investigate the base of masked UNknown
so i UNknown e heard
and you UNknown e already lost some men because of it
i don 't know who 's your source so as to prompt you to come looking for their base
if that 's true
i honestly don 't but i guess you do
both of you are known for your good work
i 'm sure you UNknown l help to get rid of them
i UNknown e prepared some wine let 's talk this over
before he died he snatched the chief 's mask
in that case he knew his identity
too bad he couldn 't tell us
so the chief is
he 's been close to us all this time !
it 's him !
liang UNknown don 't be rash
even so what can you prove ?
zeng jun what are you trying to say ?
what 's going on ?
i UNknown e changed the hiding place after i found them
these are the items
no gao yao isn 't the chief
he wants to get rid of masked UNknown as much as us !
he has the items so that he could UNknown their group
zeng jun take a closer look
this weapon is the same which killed chen UNknown
what 's going on ?
why are you protecting him ?
if it wasn 't for him
yang UNknown chen UNknown and i would all be dead
that 's just your opinion
now that yang UNknown and chen UNknown are dead who could prove that ?
think about all the robberies by the masked UNknown with all that money
and the chief is not going out and having a good time instead he 's working here as a cook ?
i 'm sure he is
we 'r e still trying to find the suspect but the masked UNknown keep killing our brothers
when chen UNknown died were you with ling UNknown and fang UNknown ?
calm down everyone !
and how about you ?
checking on someone to see if he 's indeed an old buddy
if the person you 'r e referring to is a cook
i UNknown e met him before and he seemed like an old friend
brother fang please
the person we UNknown e tried so hard to find is right under our nose
life is full of surprises
my friend i can see that you 'r e very skilled
this is highly unusual
over the years they have committed too many crimes you should know what comes around goes around
i am aware of that
a man will take his chances and face the consequences
if you 'r e a member please show us the trident
i UNknown e sworn not to use the trident unless on a masked avenger
brother UNknown why don 't you fight ?
i think he has back up
hide now !
they will understand sooner or later
what does he mean by letting a chief go ?
if he 's a chief i UNknown l fight him
that must be him
i UNknown l find gao yao back !
you know where he 's headed ?
no but i UNknown e promised him to wait here
i treat him as a friend and so does he
he wouldn 't take off just like this
you can 't disturb the zen lesson in process
from now on let 's team up
i UNknown e told you he 's a chief
he leads a team of criminals
you have gone nuts to treat him as a friend !
shut up !
i suddenly realise that you UNknown e mastered the skills of using a trident
i 'm a deputy chief of course i would have mastered it
what are you kidding about ?
i 'm not kidding
so i was wrong about you
you can 't be !
i am !
do you still remember when you arrived at the inn ?
i heard long UNknown talk of his eldest brother 's death and the kidnapping of his younger siblings
i was there at the scene
the masked UNknown are based in a deserted temple
we 'r e tough
we UNknown e killed many that 's because we UNknown e been given large sums to do so
the dowry we UNknown e robbed isn 't much this time and we UNknown e killed a famous swordsman long UNknown
and long UNknown was just a kid
how can we hurt a woman now ?
we kill anyone it takes what 's the big deal to hurt a woman ?
stand still or i take you as a rebel
aren 't you scared that we UNknown l look for you ?
we UNknown e always worn masks and we don 't know each other 's identity
i UNknown l use my way to hide and you can use your way to find me
so you refused to associate with them you UNknown e left the organization
i was right about you after all
you UNknown e been hiding in the small inn
i UNknown l have the nerve to stay in UNknown town
and being here
they are ?
the third chief is fang UNknown
just as i thought
when chen UNknown died
chen UNknown grabbed a golden mask used by a chief
that 's right
are you the new deputy chief ?
yes i am
under the chief 's order UNknown liang the young master of white tiger clan was killed
half of it to the organization and half to deputy chief
thank you chief
who 's the new deputy ?
i UNknown e no idea i tried but couldn 't find out
gao yao what do you plan to do now ?
they will come around sooner or later
you UNknown e uncovered the UNknown of the chief and third chief
go back and tell UNknown UNknown get more manpower
you thought that the base must be in some big residence
but in fact it 's in a deserted temple
all you have to do is wait you can nab them all in one go when they assemble
you should head back
you thought i didn 't notice but i heard you
i guess so
very well !
i deserve such attention !
i 'm so silly not to see it
you don 't dress the same as gao yao
you 'r e fang UNknown the third chief
i know who you are
ling UNknown the chief
the deputy chief is
now i know
i was right
they know about us
liang UNknown could then lure them to our base
it 's my treat this time
stop pulling me !
the kid 's almost dead
we should report it
can 't you see the UNknown on him ?
it 's got pinned him on the tree
so scary !
but whenever our members went alone they were attacked
we must also send someone else for back up
UNknown you go with UNknown to where gao yao was last night
the place where your brother was killed
i 'm worried
and he said that chief 's a good man and he treats him as a friend
liang UNknown zeng jun is our brother
a brother ?
i think zeng jun
that 's him !
you should be able to recognise his outfit
it looked like he was hurt by a trident
let 's avenge for brother zeng
wait for me to finish
you UNknown e nothing more to say
UNknown UNknown if you won 't hear me out all your friends would have died for nothing
let him finish
zeng jun and i said goodbye three chiefs appeared after i left
the three attacked him
and he 's found out their UNknown
why are you listening to his bullshit ?
shut up and let him finish
i don 't know why we should ;
after all he did kill zeng jun and is talking nonsense here
let him finish
the third chief is fang UNknown
what about the deputy chief ?
it 's him
you don 't ?
zeng jun 's dead who could back you up ?
he can say anything he wants
i never said zeng jun 's dead
why are you so certain that he 's dead ?
he got pierced by a trident of course he 'd die
and how did you know that ?
brother zeng please come here
earlier you said that liang UNknown is the deputy chief
and he escaped
he can 't run anymore
now you will believe me
i had my suspicions when he became restless earlier
but it 'd be impossible to prove this if brother zeng 's dead
zeng jun is indeed dead
when i got there all he could utter was liang UNknown 's name
if not for this liang UNknown wouldn 't blow his cover
zeng jun ?
he killed himself
don 't worry we UNknown e known the UNknown of the chiefs
ling UNknown fang UNknown and liang UNknown
liang UNknown too ?
this is an order to assemble them to meet at the base
the base is in a deserted temple i know where
i 'm sure liang UNknown 's there now
let 's go there !
we can get rid of them all !
from now on the long and han families no longer exist
gao yao has revealed our UNknown he 's now with UNknown UNknown and the lot
gao yao knows this place they UNknown l get here any time
let 's go to the back hall
as long as UNknown UNknown gao yao have gone there they can 't leave

hey UNknown !
this is how these two men met
brought together by a tragic destiny
in UNknown UNknown UNknown had a little daughter
her name was UNknown
at the witch
after leaving everything in UNknown 's hands
UNknown who appreciated him very much gave him his daughter to marry
dozens of years have passed
time was flying
one day a visitor arrived to see him in UNknown
during the conversation the guest mentioned the famous witch named UNknown
at the UNknown palace
at UNknown in the UNknown valley the turks were descending
rebuild all our UNknown in the mountain passes !
rebuild the fortress of UNknown
near the fortress walls
it 's the second time this happens
this is a bad sign
the wife and his child said goodbye to UNknown as he was leaving for a long trip to buy some merchandise
take good care of our son !
the fortress was being rebuilt for the third time
the tsar gathered the council of nobles and wise men of the people
it came crumbling down three times we UNknown l rebuild it again
my tsar go to UNknown she knows everything
take her advice
sit here !
he 's got a son
it already happened anyway we have to close this boy into the walls
near the UNknown of UNknown UNknown was being attacked by pirates
back at home a tragedy is taking place
UNknown ignorance superstition
i will find that evil woman !
give me a horse !
he is high up there my son UNknown !
did you tell them to close my son into the walls ?
evil woman what did he ever do to you ?
take a good look at me UNknown !
time UNknown the past UNknown
only some old ruins are the witnesses of a dark age in which a beautiful country was fighting for freedom
the end translated and UNknown by UNknown http radical UNknown UNknown com
a luxurious and miserable carnival where everything is confusing and everything is known
narrow street of wide UNknown
nervous artery where nothing stops and everything happens
and yet among that UNknown crowd that walks and walks
there is somebody that carries a seal a UNknown scar
UNknown UNknown the manager cesar robles
go to management
what do you intend ?
to do with her what you did to me ?
and later as in all afternoons the goodbye of the fellow workers the reunion with the boyfriend
and even later the modest dinner in the humble pension house the silly talk of the things of the day
i don 't have time mom
the manager asked me to go earlier
we are delayed with the job
my poor daughter !
and in the new day again the return to the cage
don 't worry
that 's why i would like to ask you a favor
don 't forget that it is upon you any request
at first i didn 't want to let her know
i simply thought that it was only a pastime for your son
but these girls have so many tricks and i fear that your son jorge will forget the class difference
and that same night
however i could do something for your
is it true that UNknown has been fired ?
that employee is my girlfriend !
and you dare to say it at my face ?
and do you think that after my sacrifices to give you a social position i will allow you to marry one these vulgar girls ?
and perhaps do you know her past ?
i don 't care for her past
i see the present and i want a future with her
and that same night
the following morning
your father all all would regret this
but you silly fool
love mother of jealousy of that UNknown jealousy that could make us feel erroneously selfish
and so among love selfishness UNknown and regrets many days passed by
it is too difficult to get a job
you know i 'm rejected everywhere because i have no recommendation
it was useless
no jobs !
and since then long nights very long ones
and one morning one of those mornings in which tempers are weakened due to a bitter night
jorge decided to look for his father 's help
we have to have and need an excuse to keep jorge
after all you know he is my son
but do you think that he will agree to leave that woman ?
what i think is that that lady shouldn 't be so bad
it seems that she loves my son
tell me miss juana if i 'm right you live close to mister jorge 's home
good will raises mountains and shortly after jorge UNknown was useful working man
you will be surprised with this UNknown
he can 't continue this UNknown life of misery and UNknown for which he was never prepared
haven 't you thought that tomorrow when jorge realizes that he had easily sacrificed his life and career will hate and leave the guilty one ?
what evil do you pretend to do nor ?
when things annoy or make you tired have to be eliminate
that 's what UNknown UNknown may have thought because the following day when juana arrived into the office
he won 't be able to work for awhile
he is very weak and needs to be attended and if possible a good stay in the country
i ask you in the name of his father to leave him alone before something painful happens
he is not ready for this kind of life
come to see me to put an end to this ; you are the UNknown of all his misery
i 'm going to the manager 's home and with that to spoil my life it is fate there is no option
my son !
according to him she was the UNknown of breaking the relationship with you the cause of all jorge 's miseries
for that reason
but for that UNknown you must abandon jorge
i 'm ready
the important thing is that jorge is safe
and what will happen to you now ?
alone in the world without money without help
i don 't know
you see you are my prisoner
i did it !
he made a toy of me for his whims
that 's why i killed him for me for all of us for her whom he wanted to spoil
and a long time later after new springs arrived
i have the pleasure to introduce to you our new manager
and this lady the future secretary

it 's a pity i don 't have a rich uncle
i 'd let him go for a ride and then i UNknown l share my inheritance with you !

upon these sunny mountains lives UNknown full of UNknown for an unknown land UNknown UNknown
hail mary !
you UNknown l always be in this way UNknown ?
but she lives alone and free among her wild goats far from home
UNknown UNknown he 's her fiance
the sails at the wind put inside her an UNknown desire
pietro the captain of the ship
an old sailor
at the village everybody looks at you in a different way than me
i want to marry you and take you by my horse until the highest top of our mountains
how beautiful will be to live over there in our house !
i can 't love you UNknown
the sun does not want to shine for me
you always foolin me
the night falls
but her desire belongs to the sea and to unknown lands
the sailors lying around the fire talk about their memories
i was still rowing while the burning ship was sinking
i saw asia
UNknown at the village
won 't you go there ?
take me with you sir
i 'd want to see the ball
oh what a beautiful sailor !
we came from UNknown
it 's been three months now we are away from our families
but this very evening we will leave towards home
if you don 't drink you offend us
her wish is coming true
you are the oldest
i could not stay at home anymore
the sea has bewitched her
and as for effect of her desire the sea is calm
UNknown UNknown towards the UNknown in the hope of finding his daughter
drink drink it 's good
we sail against the waves
on the UNknown of UNknown a storm has unleashed
it seems that the storm comes to us
tell the captain the helm is broken
saint barbara !
degenerate daughter !
oh UNknown !
the women as custom cry the dead
honest and hardworking
poor mrs agnes !
home of the captain of the ship
shame on you !
either we leave or her
make up your mind !
it 's not necessary !
wine has altered you !
yeah yeah !
if you say another word i strangle you
UNknown was living in the captain 's home as in a nightmare
and every evening
tormented by memories and UNknown
the past what an empty word !
i UNknown l go back to UNknown on another ship
when will you sail ?
tonight we raise anchor
as my sisters have left me ?
no you can 't leave
tonight i will put an end to your UNknown
you already know me !
i UNknown l escape from you !
and the tops of the UNknown repeat the same song
UNknown is dead is dead !
open the door mother open i 'm scared !
UNknown na you ?
dam ned !
forgive me !
dam ned !
yes mother i go !
live your life in peace !
thank you UNknown !
forgive me mother !
recorded by UNknown tools editing and UNknown UNknown musical editions
a good one or a simple one ?
there 's one just back there
a single ?
we met earlier but you didn 't even look at me
the beautiful thing is that i came here by chance
why beautiful ?
at one point i let the car drive me
me i 'm stuck here in the fog
i 'm a teacher
where do you go ?
have you noticed nobody watches sunsets anymore ?
maybe it happens in towns too but when my job brings me out to the country
i 'm always enchanted by the sunsets
i 'm a UNknown pump technician
there are lots around here
my name is carmen
the sea for instance
but a voice you can 't help listening to
it 's strange
maybe that 's the secret of being in love
i like your eyes
which is your room ?
the one on the right
she 's always up early for work
where can i buy flowers here ?
flowers don 't grow in the lagoon
can you send those to her room ?
i UNknown l get some fresh ones
did you like it ?
it 's a miracle meeting you again !
nothing happens by chance
no i must get to the shops before they close
i waited all night for you
i UNknown e been wondering lately why i have such a need to hear words
eyes are in fashion
bring some out
for example now
do you live here ?
yes this is my home
you must be very rich !
it 's beautiful
a family from naples lives upstairs
are you with somebody ?
not at the moment
like UNknown in a coffee cup
my grandma used to read coffee cups
she knew all about everyone who drank coffee with her
i lived with a man for a year
ten days ago he wrote me a letter
i know it by heart
some UNknown cling to your skin forever
i can still smell the scent of your skin and your words
where we stopped last time
i stayed there feeling you close to me
words do us good even in writing
a woman expects them
i want to talk to someone about it
and you picked me ?
you 'r e not french are you ?
no i 'm from new york but i live here
where are you from ?
i hope so
at one point the porters stopped
they refused to go on
the scientists got angry and tried to get them moving
they couldn 't understand the long delay
after several hours the porters set off again
finally their leader decided to explain
what had happened ?
they 'd left their souls behind
their souls ?
we should wait for them
to do what ?
were you with her ?
we met briefly
some things can 't be called off overnight
it 's her or me
you 'r e late
but caress me at the same time
i UNknown e been calling you for two days
that 's a vase to me
what 's a vase to you ?
vase of flowers
it 's an illusion
like stewed UNknown !
i slept alone
you know that
i didn 't take anybody
i loved making love to you
go fuck yourself
because you 'r e talking gibberish
say what you like but last night
i realized how much i miss making love to you
i UNknown l come back if you leave her
i UNknown e been saying no to her for three years
would she want to ?
i pitied her
for three years you UNknown e been bringing her smell here !
the smell on your clothes
the stale smell of a cheated woman !
where are you ?
UNknown the house
you never did
leaving me stuck at home !
where are you ?
is the lady here ?
no she went out
what place ?
it 's entirely my wife 's idea
i 'm not even sure i agree
don 't say that or i UNknown l go crazy
may i explain my situation ?
i prefer short stories
my husband has been having an affair for three years
i was patient
but in fact
i 'm expecting the furniture
my husband 's
i don 't know
where to ?
so you UNknown l cope somehow
i told her so
with whom ?
this is her
there 's a cure for everything
that 's what disturbs me
may i ?
i wonder why our society needs all these copies of things
not just paintings
UNknown are very costly
i believe that anyone who copies a UNknown has a chance of repeating the artist 's action and possibly UNknown if only by chance the exact gesture
a copy of the gesture
why not ?
i can see why you laugh
i won 't sell it to you anyhow
don 't worry
it 's across the street
i 'm going to church
are you a catholic ?
do you believe in god ?
what is this a test ?
if i say yes i can escort you and if not i can 't ?
is that the idea ?
are you always so quiet ?
with so many things going on around you ?
maybe i should go alone
no i should escort you
don 't worry
you must read a lot
not even the papers ?
i used to UNknown through them
if only a cherry tree could eat its own cherries !
you 'r e the tree that eats its own fruit
i think that to be happy we should eliminate our thoughts
that 's a thought in itself
that 's true
that only makes it worse !
silence fills our heads with thoughts
i mean pointless thoughts
i 'd escape
it 's never satisfied
some can be fun to satisfy
try giving up your little fun
you UNknown l see the peace it brings
we already have so many UNknown dreams at the end of each day !
i think i UNknown e got it
you show all the signs of a girl in love
it 's true
yes i am satisfied
satisfied people are rare
a quarter to 5 00
can we hurry ?
st john of malta 's
are you from here ?
i 'd really rather not
i do but they make me sad
they 'r e beautiful gorgeous for two days
then they wilt and get thrown away
the japanese don 't grow flowers so as not to see them die
why are you smiling ?
you 'r e scared of death aren 't you ?
scared is not the word
i 'm scared of life
a girl your age scared of life ?
it 's all there is
it 's the only thing we know exists
there we 'r e dead
here we can laugh
we 'r e in the beyond
your opinion is beside the point
please don 't treat me like this
your courtesy reminds me too much that i 'm a woman
you don 't like it ?
i wish i were a man
a strong man
i mean i 'd like to be as strong as a man
an UNknown that 's what you are
and like all UNknown UNknown
i want to know you better
it 's hard to relate to someone who 's in love but i 'd like to try
i 'm not saying this to please you
you 'r e not the type to like compliments
not that kind of compliment
i 'd rather be told that i pray well
can you be good or bad at praying ?
oh yes !
it was like you were dead
i was dead
are you hurt ?
i 'm fine
what if i fell in love with you ?
you 'd be lighting a candle in a room full of light
can i see you tomorrow ?
tomorrow i enter a convent
sister since you and brother UNknown have retreated from swords world and from affairs of our fortress
it 's not good to ask you get involved again
but many of our men have died or wounded
my husband UNknown hung has been arrested so i must rescue him
sister i want to ask a favour from you
please look after my daughter
if i die don 't tell her that her parents are horse thieves
raise her up so that she can lead a normal life

that liu lu UNknown and UNknown ching yang died 20 years ago

men just kill her and get reward from master
senior don 't worry let me protect you
you think with just your sincerity you can rescue them ?

and we 'r e real buddies we share happiness together
though i 'm your master we 'r e like brothers

miss liu you mustn 't go
take your hands off me
i UNknown l kill you if you will not let me go
i won 't let you go even if you kill me
brother UNknown has said you mustn 't go as it UNknown l only be in vain even if you go
i UNknown l kill myself if you won 't let me go for revenge
why must you stop me ?
we 'd better discuss for this matter
if we act UNknown we UNknown l fall into their trap
let me see your wound
you UNknown e gone and left me alone with miss
today a young man came to see miss with madam liu 's white dragon sword
he said madam liu is dead
you must keep company of madam liu if you see her in the underworld
she 's always been sick
who is it ?
what is it ?
you will never see my father
he 's dead ?
i don 't think you can hinder me
i come today as i want to talk with your father
liu lu UNknown is already dead
i want to have a UNknown with him
liu lu UNknown is really dead ?
we all will die just a matter of time
take me to see your father we should settle up now
how can i trust you of not killing my father ?
anyway my father is seriously ill
i 'm a righteous man
i promise i won 't kill him
i 'd better take precaution
you UNknown l trust me now ?
tie him up quick
how come you 'r e alone here ?
where 's your miss ?
where is she ?
it 's bad my brother left to take revenge on UNknown chen yu but he got captured
let 's see miss at once
get on the horse
she didn 't say anything else but she died peacefully
though mom pampered me very much except practicing kung fu she seldom talked to me in a UNknown way
sometimes i found her so pity so i wanted to cheer her up but she avoided me
i know she must have been missing my late brother
you know ?
i swear i must take revenge on them
you UNknown e been bleeding don 't drink so much
bullshit i am not in the mood
just now you are like a wolf staring at miss
i didn 't
you didn 't ?
what 's happening ?
tell us quickly
brother UNknown was captured by UNknown chen yu ?
my brother wants to take revenge for you he went alone to meet with UNknown chen yu
siu UNknown get me my sword
you 'r e injured
siu UNknown stay with miss at home
i UNknown l go with brother pak
no i UNknown l go alone
too many people will spoil things it 's decided already
i must go with him we can help each other out
i won 't let you take this risk
i UNknown l go with you
you 'r e seriously wounded you mustn 't go
i must go
you stay here and get recovered
pak siu fu and i will rescue brother UNknown
don 't worry nothing will happen to me
brother chi stay here don 't worry i can handle
i must go with you
i can assist you
ants gather together to carry a bone ?
brother chi someone must take care of miss liu and siu UNknown
please stay here
miss liu you mustn 't go
miss liu please do as i say ok ?
you can 't stop me this time i must go
i won 't let you risk your life
leave me alone
this wound is trivial
liu lu UNknown is dead and UNknown ching yang has been tied by us
no one in the desert dare to trouble us anymore
but my heart beats madly
you need miss peach now ?
someone 's outside
let 's take a look
it 's him
pak i 'm ok you 'd better leave at once
brother UNknown why must you do this ?
pak i 'm willing to let them tie me up
go away at once
you 'd better go away
tell yun long this is going to end up soon
you have come too ?
brother UNknown i come to rescue you
brother UNknown ?
pak just leave with yun long at once
miss liu i asked you not to come leave immediately
chase don 't let him run away
UNknown chen yu are outnumbered
though pak is with miss liu
take a rest
why you are asking me ?
your mother once told me
in a desert besides wind and sand the clouds can get vivid because of the weather
when one looks at the clouds his feeling means the life he UNknown l be leading
is it ?
i told her i saw a desert
your mother told me
stop fighting we must bring him to see the master later on
we can 't take up the responsibility
stop beating or you il kill him
give me back my brother
let me go
i don 't mind you are taking revenge on me
where 's brother ?
brother UNknown did that on his own will
no one is as silly as to let others tie him up
i think brother UNknown must have his reason for that
he wants to reconcile with UNknown hung
otherwise UNknown UNknown and his men can never capture him
you you 'r e really naive
you are not experienced at all
brother must suffer as you stirred things up you know ?
how dare you talk to miss like this ?
or else he wouldn 't have gone this time
brother chi can you say it more clearly
long you still remember ?
your mother rescued you from the fire but failed to save your brother ?
your father learned that UNknown hung was the traitor afterwards
he had your parents arrested
your mother broke off with your father as she wanted to take revenge
why must he go and find UNknown hung ?
yun long you know
he did that in order to get a UNknown
but have you ever thought over ?
you tried to rescue brother UNknown but you failed and this would alert UNknown chen yu and his men
people talk about face and righteous in this swords world
you think that UNknown will spare him ?
brother i 'm sure they UNknown l kill you this time i
i must rescue father
child you 'r e back ?
let me tell you good news
what good news ?
liu lu UNknown and UNknown ching yang were in my hand
what do you mean ?
liu lu UNknown is dead and i UNknown e got UNknown ching yang in my hand
i come back to see how you UNknown l deal with him
child you know the reason why dad broke off with UNknown ?
i don 't care what the reason is
they 'r e forced dad much all these years
they deserve dying
twenty years ago your dad betrayed his own UNknown and destroyed the family of liu and UNknown
he also caused the death of your sister
say no more i won 't believe this
i don 't care what happened in the past
liu lu UNknown and UNknown ching yang will never trouble us anymore
it seems i cannot avoid it
twenty years ago your father betrayed his men and destroyed liu and UNknown 's family and had caused the death of his own daughter
master liu yun long is taking some guys here
okay let 's meet them
it 's more than 20 years
the rival for these 20 years should be settled up now
you 'r e my sister
it 's good you 'r e okay
where 's yun long ?
yun long we UNknown e just met UNknown chen yu and others were fighting and scattered
i think they should be alright
go and find them
in fact i didn 't see the desert what i saw is a UNknown flower

UNknown kataoka UNknown bando UNknown UNknown
UNknown UNknown yoshiko tanaka UNknown mori
meet UNknown a candy boy with a sad past
young as he is he travels alone and sells sweets
this is the famous UNknown pass
in the teahouse in the pass once lived a girl called omitsu who was known far and wide for her beauty
omitsu by yoshiko tanaka
the villagers adored her for her purity and virtue
lost in thought on the bank of the crystal clear river she was a picture of beauty and UNknown
my home is the UNknown pass famous for its UNknown sweet UNknown UNknown rice cakes and the candy of omitsu 's teahouse
in her heart fresh and tender
like a wild flower UNknown a secret love
she had pledged eternal love to a handsome young samurai
the lovers spent their days in bliss
the babbling stream and the gentle wind told the story of their love
it UNknown like a fragrant summer flower unaware of the approaching fall
alas their bliss soon came to an end
as a samurai mochizuki had to return to his hometown and serve his lord
the samurai destiny is a UNknown one
it was a UNknown farewell
but omitsu already carried a child
before long she gave birth to a beautiful boy
the UNknown attitude of her fellow villagers forced the young mother to leave her home for a life in exile
meet UNknown the boss and lucky santa
UNknown the candy boy happens to pass by
what 's this ?
don 't lie to us !
they ran that way
let 's go !
you must not do this
it is bad to rob people
reform yourself !
turn a new leaf
take my money
another member of the gang
UNknown was injured and dragging slowly not far from there
played by UNknown UNknown
what am i to do ?
two palanquin carriers happened to pass by
thank god !
i will pay you
UNknown lays the trap for his next prey
a samurai and his wife walk right into it
UNknown appears out of the blue
give us your money or i 'i i kill you !
UNknown and UNknown the former ruffian rush to the scene
stop it !
c 'm on !
no please !
please master quit this life and go straight
this is yours
the gods will punish you
is this your last word ?
if you want money i UNknown l give you mine
you can 't live this life forever
the gods see everything
i haven 't always been a thief
i used to be a samurai
but one can 't live on honor alone
it is a harsh and unfair world
UNknown 's ardent appeal reached santa 's heart and he was overwhelmed by a feeling of remorse
so you won 't give up this life ?
master master !
the samurai was filled with admiration
please hear me out
to hell with you !
but santa had made up his mind
so UNknown took the road alone
let me join you
the samurai and his wife too were moved by the brave little boy
deserted by his UNknown UNknown went on alone
an ill life makes an ill end
a sense of loneliness came over him
his two friends
i miss them
it was in this moment of loneliness and desperation that he saw the truth
the sweet and gentle words of the little boy moved him deeply
what a wasted life
he had to leave the life of vice and take the path of virtue
this was his last chance
hey wait !
you 'r e an amazing boy
that 's great !
some time later
these are fit for an emperor
UNknown was a brave and gentle man but a long hidden secret of his past cast a shadow over his life
mochizuki had never married
where is mochizuki ?
her love was not a happy one
UNknown played by UNknown mori
she had the budding beauty of a fresh plum flower
forlorn was the love that UNknown in her heart as she had given up all hope of ever marrying mochizuki
what 's UNknown your thoughts
that is right
the lively voices of the candy boy and his friends are all over the market
everyone loves them
UNknown and his younger brother UNknown attend the local shrine
seeing the lovely UNknown UNknown by UNknown UNknown UNknown down on his prey
UNknown santa and UNknown give the wretch a good lesson
nice one !
a treat for children and adults alike !
yummy sweets !
sweet UNknown UNknown rice cakes
and the candy of omitsu 's teahouse
UNknown 's song floated over to the second floor of UNknown 's house
omitsu 's song
what 's the matter mochizuki ?
oh it stuck !
what is it UNknown ?
mochizuki seems to like their song
let 's call them here
we will call the candy men here
will you do that for me ?
please feel at home
come over here
what about me ?
you 'r e invited too
the samurai wants to hear your song
a former samurai UNknown keeps his cool but the other two are jumpy
i brought them
how old are you ?
i am ten sir
where 's your home ?
the UNknown pass in UNknown sir
my mother taught me that song
the UNknown UNknown
her name was omitsu
he is my son
are you my father ?
i know you are !
father father !
it 's me UNknown your son !
you 'r e mistaken
yes you are !
i was told my father is a samurai
every word pierced mochizuki 's heart like a knife
what a sad story
yes so proud and happy
come on !
please this way
mochizuki 's suppressed emotions emerged in a wave of love and remorse
i am your father
i am really your father
thus UNknown was recognized by mochizuki as his firstborn son and his friends became UNknown in the samurai 's household
look at this face !
the face of an honest man !
we UNknown e all changed a lot
in an amazing turn of events the candy boy became a noble heir
next UNknown had to be introduced to the local lord
mochizuki solemnly advances among the UNknown and proudly UNknown his son to the lord asking for his UNknown
however in an attempt to humiliate
mochizuki and his son the spiteful UNknown brothers try to spread the story of UNknown 's past as a candy boy
we UNknown e seen him many of you noble men don 't know the candy boy
won 't you give us a little demonstration ?
we 'd rather be excused
but we want to see !
how dare you refuse !
it was a painful moment for mochizuki seeing his son humiliated in front of everybody
UNknown 's servants further spread the rumor
phew candy samurai
shut up !
this is hilarious
he should become an entertainer
it 's a waste to train him to be a samurai
true true !
my lord forgive me
is that him ?
hey wait !
come come !
a fake samurai
impudent worm !
useless candy boy !
please master !
let go of me !
UNknown easily defeated UNknown but things did not end there
mochizuki 's mansion
who did it ?
i couldn 't stop myself
forgive me master
don 't !
i take all responsibility
flashing swords clash with a fearful UNknown
UNknown cuts UNknown in cold blood
the despicable UNknown
in the end mochizuki deals a deadly blow to the vicious UNknown UNknown
inspired by mochizuki 's righteous anger the rest fought like lions
the outrageous UNknown clan is the one that strays from the true samurai way
come on UNknown !
i UNknown l show you !
the custom that UNknown the superiority of the samurai class led to this hideous bloodshed
unjust customs consume us like cancer
and still we broke them and committed a horrible crime
mochizuki was torn up by shame and remorse
if only i hadn 't deserted omitsu ten years ago
then none of this would have happened
UNknown would have had a happy life
his world UNknown before his eyes
master it is all my fault
i will give myself up to the police
don 't worry about anything
must we part ?
don 't worry about me
be a good boy
UNknown 's loyalty deeply moved mochizuki
UNknown you are a noble man
you taught me a good lesson
we shall humbly accept your sacrifice and leave this town to live in exile
a sad quiet fell over as they bid a UNknown farewell
mochizuki and his only son UNknown set off on a life of wandering
the end of the UNknown pass story
you dead yet ?
he 's been asleep so long i 'd forgotten
ok go on now
i 'm old i 'm weak my strength is gone
i UNknown l build you a new cathedral
i 'm trying to pray !
you 'r e always praying !
d 'a UNknown !
so i see
you serve him UNknown
you look so young and i feel so old
the king says immediately
and all for one
i wonder how athos is doing
how could any woman resist you ?
when will you ask her ?
today as we arrive or when we leave
when i think about it i get confused
will this help ?
it 's yours
i want to die knowing it 's worn by the woman my son loves
these troops will be cut off here so shift them here and here
then we UNknown them there
but pride and contentment ?
of course your majesty
but they are also starving
if we distributed some of the food reserved for the army
the priest aramis !
like my father
i wish you to kill him
i know this is a terrible thing i ask especially from a priest
can you accept this mission and keep it private ?
i will kill both him and the man who told me
about these riots
that 's why it wasn 't sent to the army
then you must hurry
look at that UNknown !
don 't they look glorious ?
not so glorious as you
who is that ?
francois you may like young soldiers
her name is christine
assassins falling from the sky ?
i was not told of the pig chase
look at these men 's faces
UNknown admire you
a fool 's blade can be sharper than his brain
let us play a game
let 's pretend that i am king and you are captain of my musketeers
pretend my wish is law
as should you
i UNknown l never be rich but you have my heart
then i am richer than the king
i have something to give you
we offer a contest of cunning and UNknown
behold our UNknown !
now to the chase !
i command you all !
the pendant will be yours !
christine isn 't it ?
i 'd have thought it impossible but the excitement of the chase has made you more beautiful
sire i thank you
you 'r e not used to these surroundings
that is a condition we can happily remedy
you would choose a soldier who has not yet proposed above a king ?
i can only be faithful to my heart
but how faithful is that heart to you ?
wait christine !
metal clanging on metal
so it has my friend
what 's the occasion ?
as you say it 's been too long
if the great athos offers
head of the king 's bodyguards ?
must keep you busy
i belong to the past when grown men wore the uniform
at least it gives you time
to practise your violin
now for the life i UNknown e always wished him
he 's leaving home
raoul look who 's come to visit
what 's wrong ?
i UNknown e been recalled to my regiment
but that makes no sense !
you UNknown e already served at the front
has there been some disaster ?
the king is a dog !
and a coward !
and now to seduce a woman who UNknown l mean nothing to him once he 's had her
you knew this was happening !
that 's why you came !
i came to bring you hope !
i still have faith
to have kissed his hair watched him grow
i have never known a finer man than you but if the king harms my son merely to take a lover then this king becomes my enemy !
then i must hurry for i treasure your son as i treasure you
guard the gate !
get the gates !
citizens of paris listen to me
listen to me !
i UNknown l speak to the king myself
you have my word
louis you were right !
a woman has never known love until she has known the love of a king
i 'm hungry
i like to eat alone
not for you to startle me to death
it 's for your security that i UNknown e come
i know about the UNknown
your people want to love you but they are eating rotten food
rotten food ?
there is another matter
do you love any of them ?
quite frequently actually
you think my affairs are empty ?
i think it is possible for one man to love one woman all his life and be the better for it
you may be right
d 'a UNknown i fear you watch me too closely
do you question my honour ?
no i do not question your honour
it is you i care about
raoul will return soon
you are the new chief advisor
execute him for distributing rotten food
and the next time there are UNknown shoot them
please take this to the royal UNknown
that raoul son of athos
has been killed in action
sir a casualty report came
does athos know of this ?
athos my friend
the cannons killed raoul !
i beg you !
see to the wounded
i came to ask for your help
i have no way to feed my family
my father is dead my mother has a sickness of the lungs
you must still feel it spinning
listen to me !
and i have no desire for you to turn that heart to stone
i only ask you this that whatever you feel tonight
to good health
of all the wonders i have seen
aramis ! ls this the way to hell ?
a tomb !
the secrecy is regrettable but necessary
here is the problem at hand
the UNknown oppose louis wars and the starvation that results
so louis has ordered me
and to kill him
the problem is that i am he
i am the general of the order of UNknown
what do you propose to do ?
replace the king
it can 't be done
it can !
i cannot betray my king !
i swore an oath !
when a king is UNknown you are removed from your oath
an oath is an oath because it cannot be removed !
why do you follow him ?
the next time we meet one of us will die
i cannot betray my king
i will defend him with my life
then god be with you
for none of us will
i hear there was an incident at the musketeers gate where a man came intent on killing me
ls it our policy now to let would be assassins go free d 'a UNknown ?
he wished to kill his own pain
his son is dead
when i became a UNknown
i was told each time i drew my sword
i should consider not what i killed but what i allowed to live
you know who told me that ?
if he has become our enemy we should ask ourselves why
athos is gone
you know them better than anyone
are they a threat to me ?
if they are a threat we need not seek them out
they will find us
who is that ?
UNknown UNknown ?
UNknown UNknown !
i 'm sorry
i must shock you
what are you doing ?
it is your escape to freedom
who is this ?
he says he fell stone dead as he was reading him the mass
how could he just keel over ?
get him out !
no last rites !
no one will ever know
he 's right !
get out !
why was this done to me ?
you don 't know ?
what do you remember ?
i lived in a country house
i had guardians
but no friends
and you don 't know why ?
then i realised there was something about my face which had to be hidden
but i never knew what
what is your name ?
the old woman called me
these men will clean you
they won 't harm you
why are you so glum ?
why are you so glum ?
i expected action
look around you
there 's food here but louis sends it all to the army
i have no appetite
say goodbye to UNknown
you are not my priest !
and wouldn 't be even if i had one !
that 's bitter
what right have you to judge me ?
yes and i 'm more intelligent than anybody else
UNknown what is it ?
it hurts when i shit
i 'm going to hang myself as soon as i 'm sober
come on !
d 'a UNknown was drunk
i was on duty
the queen 's priest handed me a baby
do you understand this athos ?
the child i carried was the younger of the two
you UNknown !
on his deathbed he revealed the truth to louis and your mother
she had been told you died at birth
she blamed herself for believing it
she wished to restore your UNknown
but now louis was king
he was afraid to kill you for his claim to power rested on the sanctity of royal blood
so he devised a way to keep you forever hidden
for my country for my king
i bought peace with your life and with my soul
but not until i have restored you to what is yours
exchanging one for the other ?
it 's UNknown !
revolution open war !
can be adopted !
i have considered everything
and like us he has a choice
what about it UNknown ?
you have the chance to be king if you have the heart to take that chance you have the heart
do you ?
take this to my mother
my son !
i cannot bear to see you cry
then we will both die traitors d 'a UNknown
more wine !
it 's a perfect opportunity
we must act !
it 's dead !
for 1 6 years he was educated as a gentleman
and for six more he lived in that mask !
now he knows that those who should have loved him threw him into loneliness and pain
you 'r e fond of him
that 's good
nothing can replace raoul !
what is UNknown doing ?
what is he doing ?
going to hang himself
goodbye cruel world
admit it !
now you can stop boring everyone and be useful !
well all right
i UNknown e worn this mask so long
i don 't feel safe without it
i will sit with you
i can 't sleep either
you have freed me
see the one holding the lamb ?
i would tend lambs with her the rest of my life
a king you hate !
not everyone hates him
until you give me a reason i won 't
all we can do is keep faith
we all fail at faith aramis
what point ?
i understand your reason athos
you do ?
you think that 's why i 'm here ?
once all of us believed in serving something greater than ourselves
aramis had his faith
d 'a UNknown his devotion
and i had raoul
worthy of the throne
and now my son is dead
so i am here to find out if his life was in vain
if we fail in this attempt and we probably will
i am honoured to die beside you
you UNknown e created in me the need to be a better man
i will love through heaven or hell
to love you as you should be loved
remember that and give yourself no blame
yours forever raoul
what 's wrong ?
he sent it to the palace knowing that he would die and that i would be here
how would he know that ?
he was irrational
but how can i forgive myself ?
i will burn in hell and so will you
come on !
you want me to do the impossible alone ?
or treason for he is a king 's son
i can 't get him ready in time !
the urgency is not my choice
lnstead of distributing food
lmagine what will happen
and might be again
and needs UNknown
saddle my horse !
come on old man !
i love paris !
now get busy except for you !
servants have touched the UNknown
there are no mistakes when you are king
you never apologise
you shouldn 't care about me
you shouldn 't care about
you mustn 't ask about my son
and so have i
it was i who took your other son from you
i have raised a son who destroys lives instead of saving them
and i have failed to save a son who died within an iron mask
now we have a chance to make a miracle to strip all masks away forever
these rooms are yours
and whose rooms are these ?
your mother 's
we will need luck
if UNknown holds up
what your majesty ?
the ballroom is full of masks your majesty
your majesty ?
we have a present for you
let us go back the way we came
time to go your majesty
the queen mother !
we have much to talk about
and the rest of our lives to do it
some while captain
to keep raoul out of danger
he writes back
at the vanguard of the assault
in front of the cannon
you killed raoul !
take her to her room
they UNknown l try to cut us off
i am UNknown !
look out !
this is the imposter
open the gate !
i was told this imposter was dead
you knew ?
he is my brother
that has meant nothing to us !
it has meant something to me
your majesty listen to me
never once have i asked anything for myself
you have no right to ask this !
your majesty every day of your life
i have watched over you
i have bled for you
i have prayed every day
show me what my faith and blood have purchased
this one worst of all my own brother !
and what have you done to him ?
for one moment
i beg that you kill me
ln fact i pray god rewards you for your mercy
but please do not
or i will have yours
as for you my brother back to the prison you shall go and into the mask you hate
wear it until you love it
and die in it !
there were two ?
i couldn 't tell you
you had enough to bear
i have loved you always none but you
no matter what happens
christine 's room
when he leaves again tell me
i 'd rather die covered in blood than an old man lying in my piss
our old uniforms from our days of glory
i was saving them so that we could wear them in death
and so we shall !
the captain will see to the document
it worked !
the key !
i knew you 'd come !
we feared the mask would destroy you
i wear the mask it does not wear me
all that you have suffered
i would gladly have borne myself to keep it from you
go to the east gate
this way !
no one has the stomach to fight the captain
i am not angry with you
i knew you 'd lead me to them
lay down your sword and i will not punish you
you can retire in peace
if you surrender now
we 'r e dead anyway
he 's right d 'a UNknown
please let me go
i could not give up my son
your son ?
and i never felt pride as a father until this moment
they 'r e young musketeers
they UNknown e been UNknown on our legends
they revere us !
but if we must die if we must die
let it be like this
one for all
i have always wanted
all my life all i ever wanted to be was him
we UNknown the prisoner
put this madman where no one can hear his insanity
let him be fed by a deaf mute but feed him well
let him find redemption wearing the pains he caused others
take him !
after all you have done
i must ask one more service
and i pray you live for this to love me like your son
musketeers salute !

it has UNknown us to evolve from a single UNknown organism into the UNknown species on the planet
this process is slow and normally taking thousands and thousands of years
but every few hundred UNknown evolution leaps forward
well won 't it be kind of cold ?
well that 's the point stupid
otherwise it wouldn 't be an adventure
and when are you gonna do this ?
i don 't know
i don 't know what i just touched him
i didn 't i didn 't mean
call an ambulance !
call an ambulance !
don 't touch me
these UNknown manifest at UNknown and are often triggered by periods of UNknown emotional stress
thank you ms grey
after all the wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous
well we do license people to drive
yes but not to live
senator it is a fact that UNknown who have come forward and revealed themselves publicly have been met with fear hostility even violence
it is because of that ever present hostility that i am urging the senate to vote against UNknown registration
to force UNknown to expose themselves will only further expose themselves ?
what is it the UNknown community has to hide i wonder that makes them so afraid to identify themselves ?
i didn 't say they were hiding
let me show you what is being hidden ms grey
i have here a list of names of identified UNknown
living right here in the united states
senator kelly now here 's a girl in illinois who can walk through walls
now what 's to stop her from walking into a bank vault or into the white house or into their houses ?
senator kelly and there are even rumors ms grey of UNknown so powerful that they can enter our minds and control our thoughts taking our god given free will
i think the american people deserve the right to decide whether they want their children to be in school with UNknown to be taught by UNknown
ladies and gentlemen the truth is that UNknown are very real and they are among us
we must know who they are woman
that 's right ! and above all we must know what they can do
why do you ask questions to which you already know the answers ?
don 't give up on them eric
what would you have me do charles ?
i UNknown e heard these arguments before
it was a long time ago
mankind has evolved since then
yes into us
whatever are you looking for ?
i 'm looking for hope
i will bring you hope old friend
and i ask only one thing in return
don 't get in my way
we are the future charles not them
they no longer matter
this is UNknown city
i UNknown e never seen anything like that
ladies and gentlemen our savior !
whatever you do don 't hit him in the balls
you said anything goes
or are you sticking with water ?
i UNknown l have a beer
preparations are nearly completed for the UNknown united nations world summit
with nearly every invitation confirmed the event promises to be the largest single gathering of world leaders in history
the leaders of over 200 nations will discuss issues UNknown from the world 's economic climate and weapons treaties to the UNknown phenomenon and its impact on our world stage
many american UNknown have UNknown that debate over UNknown issues should be the primary focus of what is on the surface a strictly diplomatic affair
you owe me some money
come on stu
no man takes a beating like that without a mark to show for it
come on buddy
i know what you are
you lost your money
come on buddy
i 'm sorry
i don 't know
i 'm rogue
doesn 't that mean you were in the army ?
if you 'd prefer the road
i 'm not gonna hurt you kid
it 's nothing personal
i don 't know
my name 's logan
i 'm stuck !
that is all they know
time for our little test
man 's voice
where are you going ?
that UNknown l be all
where am i ?
i don 't need medical attention
yes of course
this is scott summers also called cyclops
you 'r e in my school for the gifted
what 's a UNknown ?
a very powerful UNknown who believes that a war is brewing between UNknown and the rest of humanity
i UNknown e been following his activities for some time
the man who attacked you is an associate of his called UNknown
cyclops right ?
logan it 's been almost 1 5 years hasn 't it ?
living from day to day moving from place to place with no memory of who or what you are
how do you know ?
xavier 's voice
where are you going ?
xavier 's voice
what is this place ?
cyclops storm UNknown were some of my first students
i protected them taught them to control their powers and in time teach others to do the same
the students are mostly UNknown
like your friend rogue
learning being accepted not feared
rejoin the world as an educated young woman or stay on to teach others to become what the children have UNknown called x men
welcome to UNknown high
the lower levels however are an entirely different matter
when i was a boy i discovered i had the power to control people 's minds make them think or do whatever i wanted
when i was 1 7 i met a young man named eric UNknown
he too had an unusual power
he could create magnetic fields and control metal
believing that humanity would never accept us he grew angry and UNknown
he became UNknown
if no one is equipped to oppose them humanity 's days could be over
i UNknown l make a deal with you logan
well some of these so called children possess more than ten times the destructive force of any UNknown
no i don 't see a difference
all i see are weapons in our schools
well that 's fair enough
a vote this loaded is always close
what about the u n summit ?
the whole world will be watching
maybe there 's some way you could use that to your advantage
we 'r e americans henry
let the rest of the damn world deal with UNknown in their own way
you know this situation ?
these UNknown ?
if it were up to me i 'd lock UNknown m all away
it 's a war
where the hell are we ?
i 'm sorry
how could he have survived a procedure like that ?
this also makes his age impossible to determine
he could very well be older than you professor
he doesn 't know
experimentation on UNknown
but i UNknown e never seen anything like this before
i 'm not entirely sure it 's him UNknown wants
just like you
where 's henry ?
but i UNknown e had UNknown here keep you company
she takes so many shapes
whatever you do to me you UNknown l make me right
every word i UNknown e spoken will be confirmed
are you a god fearing man senator ?
that 's such a strange phrase
i UNknown e always thought of god as a teacher as a UNknown of light wisdom and understanding
you see i think what you really are afraid of is me
me and my kind
mankind has always feared what it doesn 't understand
well don 't fear god senator and certainly don 't fear me
let 's just say god works too slowly
i think you UNknown l be comfortable here
where is your room ?
with scott down the hall
is that your gift ?
putting up with that guy ?
actually i 'm UNknown
all kinds of things
what like your professor ?
nowhere near that powerful
i 'm sure he is
so read my mind
i doubt it
if i had to do that she wouldn 't be my girl
yeah it must just burn you up that a boy like me saved your life huh ?
you ought to be careful
i might not be there next time
oh and logan stay away from my girl stay away from my girl
she UNknown l be all right
what did she do to me ?
whenever rogue touches someone she takes their energy their life force
in the case of UNknown she UNknown their gifts for a short while
in your case your ability to heal
i feel like she almost killed me
if she 'd held out any longer she could have
advanced i hope
senator this is pointless
who would take you in now that you 'r e one of us ?
tommy please let it go !
i 'm telling mommy
woman on tv
with the leaders of over 200 nations attending the secret service has transformed ellis island into a veritable fort knox for tomorrow night 's opening gala
ellis island rests less than one mile from the shores of manhattan
they say that you 'r e stealing other UNknown powers
i had no choice
if i were you
what do you mean ?
listen the students are UNknown
professor xavier 's furious
i think it UNknown l be easier on your own
you should go
it 's strange
why should this one be so important to him ?
maybe it 's his way with people
you don 't like him
how could you tell ?
well i am psychic you know
where is she ?
the brain waves of UNknown are different from average human beings
this device UNknown my power allowing me to locate UNknown across great distances
that 's how i intend to find rogue
why don 't you just use it to find UNknown ?
i UNknown e been trying
but he seems to have found some way to shield himself from it
how would he know how to do that ?
because he helped me build it
now if you UNknown l excuse me
have you ever
she 's at the train station
logan you can 't leave the mansion
it 's just the opportunity UNknown needs
i 'm the reason she took off
we had a deal
well who told you that ?
a boy at school
she was supposed to meet me for lunch
you look around
no i think you should follow your instincts
the first boy i ever kissed ended up in a coma for three weeks
i can still feel him inside my head
and it 's the same with you
there 's not many people that UNknown l understand what you 'r e going through but i think this guy 's xavier 's one of them
he seems to genuinely wanna help you and that 's a rare thing for people like us
give these UNknown one more shot ?
you promise ?
uh my height
you UNknown UNknown and your guns
that 's enough eric
what do you want her for ?
can 't you read my mind ?
what now ?
and what will that accomplish ?
let them pass that law
they UNknown l have you in chains with a number burned into your forehead
it won 't be that way
then kill me and find out
that 's what makes you weak
good bye charles
i made a terrible mistake
his helmet was somehow designed to block my telepathy
i couldn 't see what he was after till it was too late
where are you going ?
i 'm gonna find her
who 's gonna help me ?
then help us
be an x man ?
who the hell do you think you are ?
you 'r e a UNknown
the whole world out there is full of people that hate and fear you
and you 'r e wasting your time trying to protect UNknown m ?
i got better things to do
you know UNknown 's right
there 's a war coming
you sure you 'r e on the right side ?
at least i UNknown e chosen a side
i 'm looking for dr jean grey
i was afraid if i went to a hospital they would
treat you like a UNknown ?
we 'r e not what you think
not all of us
i 'm not going to hurt you
welcome to the future brother
the machine UNknown radiation that UNknown UNknown in ordinary human beings
but the UNknown is unnatural
kelly 's body is rejecting it
his cells began to break down almost immediately
what effect does radiation have on UNknown ?
there appears to be none
but i fear it will seriously harm any normal person exposed to it
so what does UNknown want with rogue ?
i don 't know
and that it weakened him
he 's gonna transfer his power to rogue and use her to power the machine
is somebody there ?
don 't want to be alone
i 'm gonna find rogue
jean get logan a uniform
whoa wait a minute
no you were the one who stabbed rogue through the chest
senator kelly is dead
you UNknown e taught me everything in my life that was ever worth knowing
and if anything happens
thud man groaning
i UNknown e seen it
i first saw her in 1 949
america was gonna be the land of tolerance of peace
are you going to kill me ?
there is no peace
women and children whole families destroyed simply because they were born different from those in power
well after tonight the world 's powerful will be just like us
they will return home as brothers
your sacrifice will mean our survival
i UNknown l understand if that comes as small consolation
put her in the machine
i UNknown l raise it
he doesn 't know his machine kills
and judging from what the professor saw if UNknown gave rogue enough power
we land on the far side of liberty island here
what about harbor patrol ?
if they have anything that can pick up our jet they deserve to catch us
well what would you prefer yellow UNknown ?
i 'm taking her down
storm some cover please
and you stay here
you UNknown l be my only defense
the first UNknown started to arrive about an hour ago greeted with a sort of garden party atmosphere which was designed to entertain them
as the others UNknown the rigid security
i just can 't see UNknown m
do you know what happens to a toad when it 's struck by lightning ?
you 'r e not part of the group
what is it ?
you 'd better close your eyes
i thought you lived at a school
so the good senator survived his fall and the swim to shore
he 's become even more powerful than i could have imagined
he 's dead
are you sure you saw what you saw ?
i would also like to thank the president of the united states for UNknown this event under the lights of the great city of new york
why do none of you understand what i 'm trying to do ?
those people down there they control our fate and the fate of every other UNknown
well soon our fate will be theirs
if you were really so righteous it 'd be you in that thing
don 't do this
cyclops can you hit it ?
i UNknown l kill her
i can 't control it like that
you could fly right over the torch
then let me go
all right do it
let 's get him out of here
i had you to guide me
how did we do ?
did it work ?
i think she 's a little taken with you
well you can tell her my heart belongs to someone else
you know you and i how 's the professor ?
he 's good
there 's not much left but you might find some answers
man on tv
and i hope in time i may be forgiven
in a related story the body of senator kelly 's UNknown aide henry UNknown was found today
preliminary coroner reports seem to indicate that UNknown was UNknown by a bear
i kind of like it
i don 't want you to go
doesn 't it ever wake you in the middle of the night ?
the feeling that someday they will pass that foolish law or one just like it and come for you and your children ?
it does indeed
i feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school looking for trouble
why do you come here charles ?
why do you ask questions to which you already know the answers ?
you know this plastic prison of theirs won 't hold me forever
the war is still coming charles and i intend to fight it by any means necessary
and i will always be there old friend
i can die peacefully because i seen a great love
in the masters house
i would like to speak with mr UNknown
why not ?
please tell mr UNknown
so one of these russian princesses whom at all costs love to be painted by the master
have they for instance a monopoly on being painted by the master ?
how come you were made a model by the master and almost his son ?
it was four years ago
these sketches are not worth anything
come back when you have learned to see correctly
i would like to paint to you !
would you model for me ?
you owe much to him michael !
but the master also must thank you !
his glory was born on the paintings in which you UNknown
at table the conversation turns to death
it is strange how sometimes i fear dying so much that i do not know like thinking of it
i run away from the horror !
i do not fear death because prediction must be fulfilled
i cannot imagine a more beautiful end than to die for being adored
for me death is simply the last stage of life
you know that your conversation has inspired in me a new picture ?
i want to paint caesar assassinated by brutus his UNknown son
and who will look like brutus ?
UNknown takes notes from our table conversation for the work that he is writing on the master
what is your prediction duke of what was spoken at table ?
that the last UNknown will know a great happiness
and will pay with his life
the butler announces to them that the carriage is leaving
i regret much i never paint pictures to order
but since there is time
i am nevertheless going to paint to you
michael the spotlight !
possibly she hopes to increase her credit by being painted by the master
there we are !
the winner is my best picture
i give it to you
there will come a day when all will belong to you
never had a picture given as much pain to master as the picture of princess UNknown
you have been up three nights without sleeping !
is that sensible ?
but when she is seated here everything vanishes
where is michael ?
go now i want to work
i will return after food
you are the culprit of my sleepless nights princess
serve the food we will eat !
we do not wait for michael ?
today we will drink in english glasses
the gentleman and the lady are already seated at table
you have sat down to eat without me ?
never have i been treated thus before
only the youth can guess that
how did you knew my eyes so well ?
where have you been throughout this time ?
i was in the country
unfortunately i must leave
you are the only one that does not suspect to anything
with regard to michael and UNknown
take away the board
close the window
UNknown 's swan lake
have pity on me my friend
do you desire to have supper with us after the performance mr UNknown ?
go now we meet soon
i want only to believe that the eternity exists
the visits of michael to the master were made more and more rarely only dictated by the last conscience of having to
the thing itself is just a UNknown
he came to request lately to me
large amounts of money several times
youth wants to live totally and youth costs money
book this sum to my account !
from now on you will have your own account with my banker
and then you will be able to begin a new page
now leave me alone michael
we could see in its last work a picture of princess z no brush stroke truer only the eyes make an exception
the effect is so UNknown that we would swear that the eyes have been painted by another hand
who knows the story of the eyes of the UNknown ?
that you hated him from first day
because he broke into my life where you wanted to be the only one that played a role
nobody knows when i am unique
nobody has the right to increase to my solitude
claude UNknown i request to you that you save the UNknown UNknown
let go of the boy
why you spoke to me never of this ?
call mercier the art dealer
that passes immediately
leave michael 's place setting
where is michael ?
that is gorgeous but
an atmosphere can be cool not true ?
and atmosphere can be warm
so in this situation
the price little concerns me
put the picture in the UNknown of michael that is its place
as of that day
today for the celebration of return of michael we will drink in english glasses
i have borrowed them
i have enough of being your model the instrument of your glory
i want finally to be a free man
not to depend anymore on your good thanks
princess UNknown asks for mr michael to the telephone
i will never respond to you to what you UNknown e just said to me michael
what could i say that does not make you suffer ?
finally came the day in which the master exposed his work
the duchess widow of UNknown UNknown UNknown
pardon my UNknown mr UNknown
have you seen my son ?
that is a man who has lost all
my girl pardon this question of a tormented mother
do you know where is my son ?
tell alice that the last UNknown has paid for his happiness
the painter of the pain
the glory of the nation
where is michael ?
i am sorry i could not come
i have brought the criticism with me
i can read it for you ?
i can read it for you ?
all write about the sky of your work is the most wonderful thing that you have ever painted
now we propose to you UNknown dollars for the sketches
to the fact where are your UNknown sketches ?
i would much like to see them again
but mr michael has just left with a large folder of drawings
possibly he has
yes charles now i am tired
i want to sleep now to sleep
but in the course at night the fate of the master is fulfilled
the master is dying
i claude UNknown that knows the solitude in this world
i will my last UNknown here
all my goods must go to my UNknown son UNknown ne michael
have you found michael ?
is he coming soon ?
mr michael will not be spoken to
i want to rest in the middle of a field
where UNknown the seeds and grows the grass and nobody will have to know the place where i am buried
swear that for me ?
jules my friend do not cry more
i go where my heart will know rest
why you smile claude ?
charles now i can die peacefully because i knew a great love
mr michael the master has died !
be quiet be still
i won 't let anyone else take the final steps for me
listen to me you son of a bitch !
you have been a plague on my life !
you UNknown me !
drop it !
since that night you UNknown e been missing for almost two years
there was a fire at your apartment
you were dead
they thought it would be best if you were UNknown by someone from your life before
they could have sent my father
he 's cla he 's from my life before
i can 't answer that
i chose not to stay with the cla after your death
you 'r e not with the agency ?
i 'm a teacher
they want me to bring you back
i mean you can imagine the kind of investigation that 's being called
hell of a way to wake up
how much time do i have before i have to go ?
they said they want you back
i don 't know who the hell you are but you are not vaughn you son of a bitch !
tell me who the hell you 'r e working for !
is it sloane ?
you 'r e home again
there are no words to make this easy
it was vaughn who came for you in hong kong
and what he told you was the truth
what happened to me ?
we don 't know
or my mom ?
vaughn said will 's alive
if there was a fire in my apartment if he thought i was dead how did will survive ?
and where is he ?
and francie is she dead ?
did they find her body too ?
i know you have a million questions but
i have a lot more than a million questions
i which i only had a million questions !
you 'r e going to have to be patient
i UNknown l talk to the
i can 't be patient !
i woke up like it was one night !
i have a scar on my stomach i have never seen before !
you 'r e telling me two years have passed
and i have to be patient ! ?
listen to me sydney
where the hell is kendall ! ?
i want some answers !
kendall is not the director of our division anymore
i 'm miserable but i look really good
we got something
it 's okay
he got the package and the decoy
he 's on schedule aboard a train to UNknown
we UNknown e received an intel that the covenant may be moving to intercept kingsley and get the chip
and we can 't reach kingsley ?
no he 's radio silent
but we got the new lead an address outside of paris a possible outpost for the covenant
contact the UNknown
he UNknown l know to make contact
and get a team in prep
i want to raid this outpost
i have to get back
dixon i want to see my dad
what is the big deal ?
your father is in prison
the national security council has had him in solitary for almost a year
their policy without exception is that he is to have no visitors
give it to me and i make your death painless
one more time
there 's so many new people i don 't know anyone here
ah just give it time
of course i know who you are !
oh my god !
actually i wrote a poem
i UNknown e lost my keys
where are they ?
ooh yeah yeah
are you guys married too ?
we just haven 't set the date yet
we 'r e not even engaged we 'r e just having a kid
well we 'r e talking about get marry
not really !
it 's it 's a UNknown
we 'd like to hear about what happened last night
i had a memory a vivid memory of the interior of the building where i was being held
i know that i was in paris and i remember the faces of at least three of my UNknown
mr UNknown report says you recall overhearing voices names including mr kingsley
this is robert lindsay
so far that 's all i remember
sounds like the group we 'r e looking for is the one that was holding our girl
last night there was a mass murder on a french passenger train
among the dead was a cla asset
he designed an aircraft a spy UNknown that could fly UNknown by radar
kingsley was en route to UNknown to deliver the UNknown
they were stolen
biological weapons chemical
they refer to themselves as the covenant
we have some new intelligence identifying one of their UNknown
we believe this is where they UNknown e taken the chip
we 'r e planning and sending a team to paris to raid the building
look familiar ?
without you we 'r e blind
you might recognize details we might not see otherwise
i 'm personally of the mind that sending you into the field so soon after your recovery is UNknown
well mr dixon you might ask yourself just how much you want to apprehend these killers
do not question my resolve
what you are suggesting is premature
perhaps if you 'd listen to what i 'm suggesting certainly not that we throw ms
i UNknown e experienced trauma myself
returning to the field UNknown is as bad as not being trained at all !
okay excuse me
i think i might be helpful in paris
but i will not even consider going unless you help me first
i wanna see my father
i have no intention of ever doing your father one single favor
and i 'm not without a heart as you will come to see
i UNknown l get you in this one time
they told me you were charged with resisting authority
dad i don 't understand
i became obsessed with your death with finding those responsible
and at a certain point in my pursuit i needed help
so i contacted the one person i believed i could trust given the circumstances
at the time she was number 6 on the cla 's most wanted list
the national security council primarily
he chose to make an example of me an UNknown power play and here we are
i was told you have a memory that you believe you were being held in paris
it 's an UNknown UNknown device i got it from marshall
we have 90 seconds
i just made it up to get UNknown and now they want to send me on a mission !
UNknown for what ?
i needed to
my friends are gone i have no job i have no home and vaughn 's married and you 'r e in prison
vaughn what ?
sydney listen to me my investigation into your death became even more disturbing than i expected
you must continue my work and find the truth about what happened to you
do you understand me ?
the only way to do that is by getting your cla clearance restored having access to my private files getting back
dad i don 't think i can do this without you
we both know that 's not true and you have no choice anyway
the cla i am certain is dubious about your return somehow you must get them to trust you again
if they learn you were bluffing about your memory it 's all over
dad what did you mean the investigation was disturbing ?
i knew you were alive
i made a discovery that you need
you probably know this but i love you
i love you too
you UNknown e all met agent UNknown
any last minute fun ?
we UNknown e got no activity outside the target building and UNknown UNknown shows the building to be clean
that 's good to hear
anything from UNknown ?
here we go
let 's move
base to UNknown
UNknown to team be on the alert for possible hostile UNknown 16 at door UNknown nine
UNknown we 'r e seeing activity
i 'm counting three now five UNknown
team we now have five possible UNknown
let 's get ready to engage
base we 'r e under attack !
we 'r e under attack !
fall back now !
all agents UNknown !
what are you talking about ?
i UNknown e never been here before
the dream i had
syd this operation was on whether you came or not
and if you hadn 't i 'd be dead too
i don 't know what to do i everything 's wrong everything 's upside down
syd we gotta get home
i can 't go back !
robert lindsay hates my father
he doesn 't trust me
he wanted results from this operation he wanted the chip
if i go back after this he UNknown l pull my clearance and i UNknown l never be able to help my father
what are you thinking ?
this was obviously an ambush
those gunmen work for the covenant
the one that was going to kill you i saw his face
if i can make a positive id that could lead to the chip UNknown
to do what ?
to recover what was stolen from the cla to make sure these men didn 't die for nothing
i 'm going to need a contact a UNknown
not with the cla
you 'r e not gonna like my suggestion
you should go see UNknown sloane
he 's now a consultant for the cla
yeah he now runs a world health organization in UNknown
after the gunfight i disappeared
you never saw me again
syd what are you gonna do ?
it 's okay
they call themselves the covenant
they UNknown e stolen something i need to get back
i UNknown e made a visual id of one of their members
i need to put a name to his face
you 'r e going to help me find him
well you must be in real trouble to come to me for assistance
his name is UNknown UNknown
he 's a former russian UNknown
a high class UNknown
i had it ready because i was expecting you
i loved you like a daughter i loved you
and even you would admit there were times i would see it in your eyes you looked at me like i was your
where the hell have i been the last two years ?
i know it was you !
what the hell did you do to me ?
sydney do you believe in redemption ?
not for you no
we do research our work on cancer has the potential to save millions of lives sydney
so much has changed since you UNknown e been gone
you remember the UNknown device ?
the machine designed 500 years ago by a prophet ?
all i did was bring all the pieces together and have it assembled
and when i turned it on it delivered a message as i suspected it would
i wasn 't prepared for what it said
the message was just one word one simple word
so i chose right then and there to give information to the cla with which they were able to UNknown over 2 dozen terrorist cells
i don 't know how you convinced the cla that you 'r e trustworthy
why don 't you check my files ?
i know you too well
i don 't buy any of it
il n UNknown a pas de UNknown ici
i tried to reach over two dozen contacts
you 'r e the only one still active
thank you for coming
this is why i love our business
i need some information
you had sydney UNknown listed as an enemy of the state ! ?
dixon your operative ran
this is why i did not want to send her out to begin with
in her condition we should be helping her not
i hate to pull rank but the department of justice is my jurisdiction
blindly trusting sydney
can you make a suggestion ?
i suggest we use our resources to locate her
oh she UNknown l be located
i want her back in this office alive !
UNknown has a meeting scheduled for tomorrow night in prague
i have the address
what it is ?
do you know what he drives ?
a sedan armored of course with a protective detail
if you want to stop that car you will need backup
no i don 't
i have the plans for the UNknown
if you want them back get the UNknown to release my father immediately
excuse me !
did you really think you could come in here and threaten me ?
i want it in writing that today is the day jack UNknown is to be released from custody
mr dixon talk to her
i 'm addressing you mr lindsay
i want that UNknown et out of jail free card for my father or these are gone !
this is ridiculous !
i UNknown e got my own pen and there 's not a chance i 'm using it
it 's your call
3 2 1
i came by to see how you were
are you kidding me ?
no i just wanted to make sure that you
don 't use rational thought as a defense with me not after all you and i have seen
vaughn you and i live and breathe madness every day on the job
there is no rational thought !
i can 't even pretend to have a conversation about anything else with you
what it comes down to is faith
what i was hoping you would say is
sydney i gave up i gave up on us
i lost faith
i 'm not gonna say i understand
i 'm not gonna sympathize with you and tell you how hard it must be for you
but you wanna know how i am ?
i am horrible vaughn !
i am ripped apart !
and not because i lost you but because if it had been me i would have waited
i would have found the truth i wouldn 't have given up on you
and now i realize what an absolute waste that would have been
one of the men i was tracking was this man
UNknown UNknown russian diplomat
this was from a hidden camera that i placed
this is how i knew you were alive
you don 't recall that man at all ?
merci agent UNknown et UNknown UNknown
akira et agent UNknown www UNknown com
where the hell is my father ?
not a problem my loyalty is flexible
you got married ?
i 'm horrible !
but because if it had been me
i would have waited
i don 't know how you UNknown the cla that you 'r e UNknown
adrian UNknown russian diplomat
this was UNknown a hidden camera that i placed
this is how i knew you were alive
they 'r e in the elevator
the clamp is set
if you were still under the influence of any valid UNknown technique
as for your memory loss some forms of torture UNknown shock therapy for example can cause amnesia
he was unarmed
your remorse is premature
i know you don 't want the cla to see UNknown tape to protect me but maybe they should
sydney they UNknown l detain you indefinitely
maybe the cla shouldn 't either
well i trust you
your mother may be helpful assuming she 's still alive
i haven 't spoken to her in a year but we established a protocol for making contact
i UNknown l try and reach her
you deserve to get on with your life
why does moving heavy objects automatically mean that i need one of those beers ?
chop chop !
it 's nice to see that again
i mean are you going to be all right ?
by yourself ?
i mean francie 's been dead for two years but i feel like i saw her a few days ago
and now that will is in witness protection
i can 't even contact him
all my friends are just gone
not all your friends
are you kidding me ! ?
and you UNknown e got me as a neighbor UNknown me you 'r e set
can i ask you something ?
i 'm not sure if you really wanna hear this
when vaughn heard that you were dead ?
he dropped off the face of the earth
i mean literally syd he he was
out of the country for like six months
you need to know that he was not cavalier about moving on
i mean i could barely convince him UNknown consider coming back to the agency
he 's thinking about coming back ?
well you don 't have to worry about that n UNknown UNknown it 's not gonna happen
because of me because i came back right ?
at 1300 UNknown two agents of the central intelligence agency were abducted in berlin
we claim responsibility for this act of aggression against the world 's UNknown UNknown
who we are is unimportant
what we represent is unimportant
what we want it to be heard
within this audio file are coordinates leading UNknown a designated location
we believe they were abducted by a group known as
the covenant a loose UNknown of russian UNknown UNknown of former central committee members and retired UNknown ; that we know little about them
the covenant seems to function like an organized crime family
now the pickup location the covenant UNknown is a theater in munich in the red light district actually it 's an adult theater
now i checked and um today 's feature now a rough translation
i don 't actually speak german UNknown 's penal code part deux if anybody cares i have the times
i don 't like the idea of sending someone UNknown alone to pick up the package
it 's doubtful they 'd betray us at this stage
breaking their own rules before we even know their demands would result in a loss of negotiating UNknown
i UNknown l go
that 's it
you 'r e allowed to give yourself time UNknown you jump back in with both feet
the best way i can think of to start feeling normal is to start acting that way
i need this
there 's a group
i 'm in the theater
we UNknown e got you on fly by UNknown
the perimeter 's clear no suspect signals UNknown 'r e on standby
it 's a box ; i 'm sweeping it for explosives
it 's clean
proceed with caution UNknown
there 's a piece of paper UNknown in his mouth
gimme a sec
i have their list of demands
as some of you already know the covenant has agreed to return our remaining agent in exchange for the release of mr UNknown
i 'm here to inform you trading UNknown for your remaining asset UNknown been approved by the UNknown
wait a minute we can 't just let him go !
to the best of our knowledge
UNknown 's been bled dry of every piece of intel he knows
the burden of criminal justice not UNknown he now has a value to us only as a commodity in trade
without even knowing why these people want UNknown UNknown can we even consider this ! ?
we think we know why they want him UNknown want him so they can kill him
intelligence provided by UNknown sloane indicates that UNknown may be responsible for the death of a high ranking member within the covenant
they may want revenge
UNknown sloane 's intel at face value is insane
while i 'm fully aware of your history with sloane if director dixon can trust him i think you can too
for the record i don 't
i never will
i 'm UNknown the trade
you and UNknown will escort UNknown
UNknown to the exchange point in mexico
you UNknown l leave in four hours
i UNknown l come back
since when did the UNknown become so eager UNknown negotiate with terrorists ?
bob UNknown has the white house spin machine ready to cover him when his actions prove ill advised
he 's nearly UNknown
you UNknown e come close enough in forcing his hand with my release
while you 'r e in mexico making the exchange
i 'm going to UNknown to see sloane
he UNknown l be expecting me and we should appear UNknown
i UNknown l have that adjusted
where was i buried ?
you were cremated
n UNknown UNknown pas UNknown soir les 400 UNknown on le UNknown la UNknown math que n d 'a UNknown part ce sera une version sans sous UNknown
so if you guys didn 't understand what i just said good luck on the quiz
you 'r e a french teacher huh ?
on the off chance that your hesitation is out of some courtesy to me you can forget about it
i i mean
don 't worry about me
the other day you said i gave up on us because i didn 't have faith ; that somehow you didn 't mean enough to me
when i said that i was
no let me finish
like you were still around
literally out loud whole conversations about nothing the weather
should i get a new car ?
should i have another drink ?
then one day you started answering
i mean i could hear you in my head
like you were right next to me sydney
and although UNknown i knew i was a guy who stayed up nights drinking UNknown to his dead girlfriend
still i couldn 't stop
so before you tell me you can handle me UNknown back to the cla
there is two things you need to know
first is that i was so in love with you that it nearly killed me
and second that i don 't regret moving on with my life
the president of the world bank that you stop by his table
we UNknown e received word that he 's willing to make a UNknown contribution to our cancer research
his wife 's a vegetarian so make sure she 's attended to
send him in
a world relief organization the sheer audacity of your alleged UNknown would be UNknown if you weren 't so dangerous
i was wondering when you 'd come to see me jack
you don 't really expect me to believe that you UNknown e changed
i expect you to believe in the UNknown of my UNknown
jack i pursued the UNknown puzzle across the world for over 30 years
it never occurred to me that when the UNknown were finally assembled that they would produce nothing more than a message of peace
i UNknown l come to the point
i believe you 'r e responsible for sydney 's disappearance
tell me why right now and give her the peace of mind she deserves
in exchange i UNknown l halt my efforts to UNknown your pardon agreement
jack don 't go digging ; you won 't find anything
i know that you were imprisoned for UNknown contact with your ex wife
you went to irina UNknown for help to find sydney
now i wouldn 't have believed that you would ally yourself UNknown a woman you vowed you 'd never trust again
so if you 'r e capable of having such a change of heart why is it so hard to believe that i am as well ?
because every morally questionable thing i have done has been to protect sydney
you don 't have the same excuse
this file contains all the leads i pursued mostly dead ends
i 'm hoping you UNknown l find something in it that 's useful
i trust that you will look at it before you dismiss it outright
should i take this as your official denial of any involvement in sydney 's disappearance ?
then you UNknown e just made the worst mistake of your life
i 'm going to bury you
i wanted a word before you get traded
dear god it can 't possibly be you
don 't start this conversation by acting surprised that i 'm alive
i UNknown l be glad to pay you the same courtesy n if you simply tell me what you 'r e getting at
that explosion in my apartment was a cover up to make the cla believe i was dead
what i believe is that sloane abducted me ni think you know why but you failed to mention that in your confession
if i 'm to understand what you 'r e saying you have no idea where you UNknown e been for the last two years
i 'm speechless
what if i said i still don 't believe you ?
i 'd say it 'd make no difference
in 24 hours i UNknown l be free and UNknown UNknown l remain in the dark
see you in mexico
each side is allowed no more than a five man cover team
once the exchange is initiated UNknown and UNknown will be released simultaneously
i assure you this organization the covenant is as much a mystery to me as it is to the cla
i can 't imagine why they 'd want to make this trade
you 'r e about to find out
my life 's in danger isn 't it ?
space ops we UNknown e received a call signal
should i confirm ?
we have a visual on agent UNknown
they 'r e not ours UNknown
we 'r e trying to get a visual
there 's a chopper UNknown
it 's one of ours !
cla UNknown !
put down your weapons !
this operation has been UNknown by the national security council !
take cover !
lindsay ambushed us !
you used my agents as bait !
i 'm trying to UNknown your missing agent n without releasing mr UNknown
now i 'm sorry i didn 't fill you in director dixon but i don 't trust the cla to maintain operational secrecy
you son of a bitch !
yeah can i get back to you director ? UNknown 'm a little busy
son of a bitch !
we should have gotten that last hostage back
we would have if UNknown the hell do you think you are ! ?
i 'm the person who 's going to UNknown you accountable if they kill him !
oh you 'r e going to hold me responsible ! ?
did i stutter ?
to let you know that i will take you to the mat every time you pull something like this !
i am not impressed by the fact that you play golf with the president
what you did was UNknown and UNknown criminal !
did it slip your mind that i am UNknown director of the national security council ! ?
i could pick up the phone and have you thrown UNknown the same jail cell your father just UNknown
hell it 's still warm !
show me how it 's done !
if you 'r e finished this is the men 's room
who let you in ?
chateau UNknown UNknown
on the other hand it does seem that you owe me
and what would that price be ?
800 million dollars
that mr UNknown you do
sydney vaughn 's qualified for UNknown
until his field rating 's been UNknown UNknown UNknown l be on analysis but he 's back effective immediately
if there are any special considerations either of you would like me to take into account now 's the time to speak up
at 10 o UNknown lock this morning
UNknown walked into the thornton bank in the UNknown islands accompanied by UNknown san UNknown o a known operative of the covenant
he was then led downstairs UNknown he used his UNknown to access an executive vault
inside the vault was a little over 800 million in gold bullion
more surprising is the fact that UNknown had no idea n he was entitled to that money
his murderer has never been found
however a source of mine has provided evidence indicating he was a UNknown of the UNknown royal family in russia
the money was in his trust when he died
it went to mr UNknown UNknown 's son
they were tracked to a frankfurt night club UNknown for selling top of the line synthetic drugs
analysis thinks its a front for the covenant
do we have reason to believe the last hostage is still alive ?
the information they could extract from him UNknown be priceless to our enemies
his name is otto UNknown
drug dealer ; he runs the club
he UNknown l know where our agent 's being held
i want you to accompany the hostage rescue team
actually i had an idea
i think syd should go in as a UNknown major UNknown know harvard UNknown totally spoiled maybe she got kicked out UNknown UNknown UNknown in her UNknown or crystal crank
without that tape the cla can 't link you to his death
this can 't be a coincidence
i 'm responsible for UNknown 's death and nine months later the covenant gets UNknown released in exchange UNknown his 800 million dollar inheritance ! ?
it 's looking more likely they 'r e responsible for your 2 year absence
be it under UNknown or by some other unknown means they compelled you to carry out the assassination
i UNknown e scheduled to contact your mother tonight ; UNknown she UNknown l be some help
it 's for him
thank you for meeting with me
i like to keep my options open although i doubt you can improve on my little cocktail
i can triple your sales
take a look
i was a UNknown major at harvard not that i think they UNknown l be asking me to make UNknown UNknown speeches in the near future
their loss my gain
i UNknown l UNknown alter it according to the UNknown UNknown saw and have it back to you within the week
if you don 't see demand go up you owe me nothing
somehow i would not mind being indebted to you
make yourself comfortable
this has a street value of 50 000 dollars
mind if i try it ?
be my guest
i UNknown l need some sort of collateral
i do accept other forms of payment
there 's an air bubble in there
do exactly as i say or i push the UNknown
where is the alarm terminal that protects the sub basement ?
okay down the hall first door UNknown i only manage the facility
i do not know the codes i swear !
UNknown to space ops
i UNknown l need a minute to hack
copy that UNknown
alarm is active
once UNknown UNknown the alarm we UNknown l proceed inside
marshall why does all this UNknown run to the control room ?
looks like some sort of UNknown system
i UNknown e got the code ; i 'm entering it now
what could it be used for ?
it could be a UNknown based fire UNknown system UNknown alarms
sydney stop !
the alarm will be triggered by that sequence !
remember the security system in UNknown ?
it 's the same system !
those numbers can be converted into a password ; that is the real code !
read me the sequence !
give me a pen
blue team the system is UNknown
space ops guards down
oh thank god !
he 's okay
you were my favorite
what are you talking about ! ?
wh why why did the covenant take two years of my life ! ?
the last thing i remember seeing was the missile threat warning on my cockpit display
the next thing i know
i 'm being lifted by a special forces team out of an UNknown hospital
i still don 't know what happened in those 18 months in between
the hardest thing is what i do remember
my life before
even worse than not remembering are the dreams
right now it just helps to listen thanks
how long you been back ?
a little over a week
the dreams start yet ?
do i still have feelings for him ?
of course i do
i i didn 't mean to interrupt
i i didn 't know you were here i i i 'm sorry
it 's okay really
i guess i did
he 's assigned agent reed here in his place UNknown assist our efforts against the covenant
she UNknown l also be looking into the murder of UNknown UNknown UNknown part of a joint investigation with the kremlin
if there 's anything i can do to help
you should know in addition to being the new UNknown liaison
i 'm also michael vaughn 's wife
how 's that ?
no no no i 'm good i 'm good
okay all right a little one just a
think about it all the paper
newspaper clippings from high school UNknown and UNknown
i was never gonna wear again ever and pictures and picture frames
yeah but there 's gotta be something that you had that that it just kills you that you don 't have anymore
i mean like a thing like a thing like
i know what you mean
i used to have a first edition alice in wonderland my mother gave it to me for my 5th birthday
despite my roller coaster relationship with her wherever she is that was one of the things i sort of loved
okay this is it
which one ?
and let me just say for the record that i 'm gonna be your friend in there and if you need someone to talk to or if you need someone
like a shoulder to cry on
i just want to be there for you
oh tomorrow 's going to be fine
no it was my fault
you had no idea
russia s early warning system was UNknown
they assumed it was an incoming missile attack
it wasn t a missile
it was a satellite that had fallen from orbit
as a result of the UNknown attack the russian president UNknown his nuclear briefcase UNknown a UNknown to a UNknown sequence
with two minutes to spare they UNknown visual id and scrubbed the launch
ten minutes later
since then he s worked for a privately held french contractor
it was their satellite
do we have any idea why ?
not yet but on the phone call he and UNknown discussed meeting to move on to phase two
we ve tracked UNknown to mexico city
we ve ordered a team of local agents to UNknown him
if we re gonna grab UNknown i d like to be on that team
it isn t our intention to grab UNknown
the UNknown believes we may learn more about the covenant by tracking UNknown s movement in the hope he il lead us to the covenant s key players
that s fine in theory except that i guarantee that within five minutes of that meeting we will have lost UNknown
it s happened before
i may have missed a lot in the last two years
i mean quite a bit but the fact that UNknown is already UNknown with an organization UNknown hostile to the united states and apparently russia indicates
as i was going to explain to you our optical satellite resolution has increased dramatically
we have real time face recognition
all the technology in the world can t and won t fix our problem
it s the people we need to stop !
UNknown for example now i m familiar with the strategy you re suggesting the cla employed it against UNknown 6 and i saw that
the risks you are describing have already been UNknown into our analysis
and as for UNknown 6 the alliance doesn t exist anymore
well the only reason that UNknown 6 and the alliance broke down is because UNknown sloane a man the white house pardoned by the way wanted them to !
so do me a favor and don t revise history that i lived through !
all right enough !
capturing UNknown while it might put a smile on my face will do nothing to shut down the covenant
for the moment UNknown remains free
standard surveillance operation
you leave in an hour
i hate her !
she just lost two years of her life
was she any nicer two years ago ! ?
because she s the most UNknown person i have ever met !
i understand why you have a problem with her
no she s the one with the problem !
i m not going to apologize because i remember the last 24 months or because i m married to the man that i love !
you re UNknown emotionally
she s been gone two years you d think she d listen to someone instead of talking all over them !
she s horrible !
give her a minute !
i mean the way things are no one would blame you if the two of you hated each other
but i actually believe that you il end up respecting her you might even like her
just remember that i love you
how was the first briefing with UNknown ?
yes as i m sure i did to her
what is this about ?
you don t think they know ?
that you re the murderer ?
and as our current bad luck would have it the UNknown s assigned this investigation to vaughn s wife
i know what you re thinking but the longer we withhold this information from them the more guilty i seem
the techniques that would be employed to UNknown your memory are UNknown surgical dangerous procedures that could leave you with permanent brain damage
that is not happening to you ; not as long as i m alive
sydney we ve discussed this
you need to stay focused ; you have to do your job
UNknown into the cla is the only way you re going to get the answers you re looking for
i ve already talked with UNknown ;
i told her i might be able to help the investigation
she s agreed to let me see the footage
you il go to mexico city ;
i il do what i can to ensure this remains our secret
marshall any luck ?
can you loop that ?
not enough to make a positive id is it ?
well not like this
their UNknown programs generate UNknown interpretation using UNknown analysis
i never oh chin ups i could never uh you know there were always kids laughing at me but this ?
i was born for this
how long will it take you ?
these UNknown values are a mess give me 72 hours ;
i think i can id this woman
this is the worst disguise yet !
okay uh this chip has a gig of memory in it or as they say here la UNknown
that s enough memory to transmit full resolution photos
what s this ?
here we go
i need to move closer to get a look at those pictures
don t get too close
be careful UNknown
well it appears they ve revealed themselves
as i told you they would
codes are changed twice a week
these go into effect the day after tomorrow
this is our target correct ?
okay we ve got it UNknown
now get out of there !
that woman was watching us
UNknown i think i ve been made
UNknown stay put
if she s cla we should be going
she might have seen the photos
then i suggest you make sure she didn t
UNknown there s a freight entrance at the back of the market northeast corner
you should have a straight shot out
get away !
senorita in the UNknown !
you know who you are !
reveal yourself or the girl dies !
you ve got five seconds !
i il be giving the orders thank you very much
drop the gun
shut up !
marshall we need his UNknown signal now !
sydney the mission in UNknown UNknown san get ready
i il tell you when
marshall what frequency are those guys UNknown on ?
UNknown patch us through to the UNknown UNknown
kick it over
give it to me
how loud ?
the camera s in my glasses
give them to me
almost there and the girl
we don t know why
yeah but we know it has something to do with UNknown whatever that means
when i was at UNknown 6
i think i heard sloane mention something about a project called UNknown
you re kidding me ?
you know what it is ?
what UNknown even means ?
no all i know is the myth
a woman so ugly that if you looked at her you d turn to stone
sounds like the myth of my college girlfriend
she actually dumped me for a UNknown at a UNknown UNknown concert
how embarrassing is that ?
i haven t even asked anyone how they met
are you asking me ?
the UNknown was wrapping up the case on your mom we were all UNknown UNknown was the one asking the questions
they hit it off
it was fine her parents farm in virginia
you know she s senator reed s daughter so
no i didn t
was everyone there ?
i m not trying to rub it in but
i i don t want to be dishonest
i should ve thought of it before
i mean come on isn t it obvious ?
a prior image model with UNknown surface reconstruction
i don t know what i was thinking
have you made a positive identification or not ?
well no not yet
okay now after an application of my UNknown reconstruction genius this is where we are now
how s it going ?
marshall s ahead of schedule
when do you think you il be finished ?
oh i don t know i d say what maybe uh noon tomorrow ?
sydney was right
it s an UNknown satellite pulse weapon
once operational it can cripple our network of UNknown UNknown nsa you name it
we d be blind to a potential attack
you see that s what s so genius about this weapon
it beams a UNknown at one satellite in the chain which then UNknown a pulse across the entire network
you re talking about hundreds of UNknown most with classified UNknown UNknown
how does this tie in with the covenant ?
the man UNknown met with
he never knew where it ended up
according to the time stamp it was taken by a satellite exactly four minutes after UNknown sent that other satellite of his crashing into UNknown park
see these UNknown entering the science ministry ? here must be a bunker underneath
according to the UNknown 6 UNknown UNknown is stored in that bunker
and now UNknown and UNknown are planning to steal it
just a shot in the dark but why don t we call the kremlin and let em know what s up ?
the russians claim to oppose UNknown satellite weapons
they re not about to admit having one
bottom line we have to access the bunker and steal it before UNknown gets it
i il have strategic services list our options
meet back here in one hour
no problem ; i can corrupt that image but the terms of my parole UNknown me from using a computer
you should know that jack i believe you wrote them
how s it rendered ?
UNknown surface reconstruction
i il see what i can cook up
i need it by noon tomorrow
i have an iq of 170 jack i m not david copperfield
i il do what i can
we have to do better than this
an hour running UNknown and the best we can come up with is sloane !
well through his cancer research
sloane has developed a relationship with the science ministry
if we can get into the ministry we can access the bunker and destroy UNknown before UNknown and UNknown can steal it
i don t want to be the voice of UNknown every time i walk into this room
i know we re all qualified to make decisions here but to me
sloane is still a criminal
as we ve discussed sloane is a necessary evil
we need access to the bunker ;
sloane can get it for us if we can use him
i don t see why we
maybe you haven t been lucky enough to have first hand experience with that UNknown
she UNknown his deal
look none of us are any illusions about sloane
the only reason he was given a pardon is because he provided us with intel that led to the destruction of terrorist cells
of course he did !
he used you to wipe out his competition
let me guess so far his intelligence has been accurate
yes and the first slip he makes his pardon will be revoked
when is your next scheduled briefing with sloane ?
you have regular meetings with him ! ?
i want both of you to go in as well if sloane can help us UNknown the bunker
i don t want to waste a minute is that clear ?
do you mind ?
i thought i m not sure how exactly but i thought we should at least acknowledge that
no one would blame us if we hated each other but i hope that doesn t happen
i don t hate you or vaughn
that s what makes it so difficult
we just got intel from nsa
they tracked UNknown onto a plane from berlin headed to frankfurt only when it landed he wasn t on board
which means if sloane doesn t help us today
UNknown will get to UNknown before we do
i m sorry
you work with the science ministry all the time
how difficult is it for you to add the names of two of your employees to the guest list of an awards banquet ?
actually it s not difficult at all
it s what you plan to do once you re inside the ministry that concerns me
we made it clear that topic is not open to discussion
UNknown to my pardon agreement
i am under obligation to pass along intel as appropriate
however i am under no obligation to assist you or anyone else to break the law
now as you know millions of people rely on relief that this company provides
i couldn t possibly endanger that by exposing UNknown or myself to criminal charges
certainly not with my history
you ve made your obligations clear ; now let me clarify mine
i am obliged to extract UNknown pain from you the moment you are no longer a valuable source of intel for the cla
personally i hope you don t help us out
i ve missed you sydney
i really have
i il simply tell the ministry that you re high level UNknown and you re looking for a new investment
you know where to contact us
i il expect to hear from you within the hour
mr vaughn you know i remember how close you were with sydney
i m sure you share my relief in having her back
just get us on the list
are we on the list ?
under the names tomas UNknown and UNknown milan UNknown investors
god that was a good third date
yeah it was when you spilled your drink on the ambassador ?
what was i supposed to do ?
he was staring down your dress all night long
look how handsome you are
i il see you in los angeles
it s a UNknown worm
UNknown it onto the network ; it singles out the files you re interested in and UNknown the data so the image can t be fully rendered
i know you can kiss me
how long will that take ?
i can t say it depends on the size of the network
there is one catch
minister tomas UNknown and UNknown milan
UNknown sloane sends his regards
mr sloane is an amazing man
and a great friend of science
the guards are gone
the thumb s the UNknown
and the face recognition UNknown ?
ready to kick in
mr UNknown what can i do for you ?
is director dixon in ?
no he s over with marshall
is there something i can help you with ?
we re almost into their video surveillance feed
UNknown must already be here
oh god he s with UNknown
yeah and he doesn t know we re coming
the program will be ready to render in a minute
uh i was curious lindsay UNknown the president right ?
you think maybe you know assuming this all goes well that he could uh request one of those white house tie clips for me ?
or uh peanuts from air force one because i
love peanuts and you figure they d get top quality being as you re um the president
oh here we go
i need you to secure all the access points with
oh uh UNknown ?
i was wondering if you might show up
i looked for you upstairs at the party
i ve taken the liberty of UNknown the elevator service
there s no way we can steal UNknown
we can t let UNknown get it either
we il have to destroy it
we could still rig the generator to blow
we do that this whole UNknown s going with it we won t have a way out
that could be an UNknown vent
we could crawl inside and get out
we might not make it
we might make it
we il have the UNknown core in 30 seconds
what the hell was that ! ?
that generator powers the UNknown system they ve UNknown the voltage
UNknown is fried
what s happening ?
anything yet ?
so no positive identification of UNknown s killer ?
unofficially they ve confirmed that UNknown was destroyed
anyway i il see ya later
UNknown UNknown www UNknown com
there you see that ?
l look there he 's saying he 's saying jule or julie
he could be saying any number of things
i have already subjected this video to the most intense UNknown UNknown available to the cla
there 's gotta be something in there that can lead us to
sydney no good will come from doing this
i committed a murder i have no memory of ; this isn 't about punishment !
i understand this haunts you but you have to stop
yes it haunts me !
i lost two years !
i do not have one memory of that time ; all i have is this
i killed a man i killed a defenceless man in cold blood
what was i thinking ?
did i know it was UNknown 's father ?
what would compel me to do something like this ! ?
did someone condition me ?
if they did what else did they have me do ?
i UNknown e been living with these same questions of over a year
we have no answers yet
when you compelled the UNknown to release me from prison you told me you 'd done so because you needed your father ; that you needed my strength
twelve months in solitary would have an effect on anyone ; something that allowed me to stay focused was your strength
don 't lose it now
hello ? yeah
that was UNknown
a four man team broke into an UNknown lab
the place did cutting edge UNknown research into UNknown
like west nile UNknown and UNknown
what were they after ?
they took four UNknown containing strains of UNknown
the 5th was damaged during the heist UNknown one of the team members
the one we 'r e questioning ?
laszlo UNknown a hungarian national
he 's an expert at cracking high end security systems
he 's in isolation at the stafford naval hospital
and the french just handed him over to us ?
apparently they share our desire to learn more about the covenant
why did the UNknown want me in on this ?
i wanted you michael said you were the best
mr UNknown can you hear me ?
my name is UNknown reed ; i work for the united states government
i UNknown e been sent here to find out whom you were working for
who is responsible for putting you in the condition you 'r e in now ?
you might have none
there 's no one left to be afraid of no one to be loyal to
there 's only yourself
i cannot help you stop the second job
agent UNknown got UNknown to admit there is a second heist in the works
while we believe the stolen samples have already been delivered to the covenant
UNknown says they will not be used until after this second job
he said they were planning to UNknown the virus
why is that ?
okay does everyone here speak science ?
oh sorry i could help explain
that 'd be great
UNknown is a level 4 UNknown ; that 's the highest UNknown
how could it be any worse ! ?
they could make it airborne
and we have no idea what the covenant 's UNknown is
simon walker point man on the damascus UNknown job in 99 and the UNknown break in at UNknown
cold blooded contract guy ; only uses other UNknown
this time his team included javier perez former lieutenant in cuban special forces ; munitions expert and tactical advisor to the group
avery UNknown UNknown vehicles equipment weapons
finally laszlo UNknown security deceased as of twenty minutes ago
we know there 's another heist in the works ;
mr walker will need a replacement
you want me to take UNknown 's place on their team
walker 's already been picked up on echelon
we know he 's in the market
it 's deep cover
the covenant will take possession of whatever the team steals
if you can place a tracking device on that we believe it will lead us to their center of operations
walker 's in UNknown ; you UNknown l go in as a UNknown security expert
vaughn and UNknown you 'r e on backup
UNknown i want you to go see sloane ; have him use his contacts find out what they 'r e after
you leave in two hours
i UNknown l come by after op tech
oh hey real quick
you didn 't give any details on the weapons that UNknown was using
uh no i didn 't but that 's not really the point of the report
well it 's not the point but it 's important
how is it important ?
we broke into the bunker and destroyed the facility
honey you know how much i depend on the details its how i form my questions i need to
who cares about the weapons ! ?
i care !
all i 'm asking is that you be more specific
i UNknown e never gotten notes on my reports before
the better you do your job ; the better i UNknown l do mine
it was a UNknown 100 9 millimeter
we can 't risk them picking up any stray radio UNknown so i UNknown l be monitoring you with a UNknown UNknown ;
i UNknown l be able to hear you but you won 't be able to communicate with me
what 's this ?
marshall put a transmitter chip there on the back
there 's an UNknown
i heard peach was the new green
i thought UNknown was the new green
no UNknown is the new peach
you UNknown e got a lot of reading to do
you can 't go up
no the gentlemen inside already have
i 'm losing the signal !
i 'm aiming the UNknown right at her
i should have worn the ring
get over yourself okay ?
no one aims the UNknown like i do
please walk away for your own good or i UNknown l have to accompany you
excuse me ma 'a m
mr walker would like to speak to you
good to see you too
it 's not an alias she 's ever used with us before
there 's no mention of a julia in her UNknown 6 files
i think this guy just called her julia
where in the bloody hell have you been ?
isn 't that the question of the day ?
oh come on i know you can do better than that
a girl 's gotta have some secrets
all right look all right at least tell me what 's with the new look
i barely recognized you
uh you know i UNknown e missed working with you
why do you think i came back ?
you 'r e a right UNknown you are
i heard about UNknown
now you never met UNknown ?
yeah you 'd have liked him
i wanna take his place
well as it happens we do have a job coming up but UNknown was security
i am a girl with many talents
and i 'm your man
tell us what you know about simon walker
we know he 's on a job for the covenant but we don 't know what he 's after
this details the first of what we believe to be two related UNknown
we think that whatever the covenant has hired mr walker to obtain will in some way UNknown the virus they stole earlier this week
i must admit i was concerned for you when sydney UNknown
i remembered seeing her with vaughn their relationship reminded me my own with my late wife
it was the kind of bond that even death cannot UNknown
ah ms reed you shouldn 't doubt yourself
you 'r e very good at what you do despite how you got the job
what does that mean ?
i UNknown l see what i can do hmm ?
meet the fellas avery javier this is julia
i can see why you wanted her along
there 's no time for small talk
oh i know
let 's go
how nice for her
pity really because it 's up in the penthouse with her right now gathering dust in a safe
you want me to steal it
well consider it your interview
i 'd like to see you wearing that necklace
just the necklace right ?
you want me to steal the necklace with this ! ?
we have something else for you
get me the police
there 's a robbery in progress at the hotel UNknown
the police will be here in about 7 minutes
you really think she 's that good ?
oh yes well she used to be
turn down service ?
we do that they UNknown l know syd 's got a tail there 's nothing we can do
una UNknown ?
please have a look around
we 'r e going to investigate
whatever she just did man
she 's good she is really good
i had time for a swim
right i UNknown e got a meeting in paris tomorrow night ; we UNknown l meet at the UNknown on thursday to UNknown out the mission
here 's the tech you UNknown l need
well welcome to the team
i need to learn how to crack an UNknown safe
UNknown is on with marshall UNknown the specs for you
okay i know you think this op is too dangerous for me to continue
yes i do but that 's not what i was gonna say
so what ?
no tell me what 's going on
look i know we 'r e not where we were but even before then professionally we never kept secrets from each other
i 'm still on your side
you 'r e right we 'r e not where we were
and trust me when i tell you i am doing you a favor by keeping you out of it
no that is not gonna work with me
it 's gonna have to
i can 't afford to make a distinction between professional and personal ; not in my life
i mean this job took two years from me
everything is personal
responsibilities ! ?
what UNknown ! ?
or is that distinction irrelevant ! ?
i 'm not punishing you
you think i am i 'm not
we have a bigger problem
what 's that ?
i tried shutting down his inquiry but apparently something you said has made that impossible
all i said was that i couldn 't talk about it
which of course has only UNknown his interest
what UNknown his interest was hearing simon walker call me julia and then kiss me like his prom date !
i can 't compel vaughn to stop being curious
i don 't need to remind you of the consequence if UNknown and the UNknown connect you to the assassination of UNknown
they will subject you to detailed UNknown and painful procedures in the name of UNknown your lost memory
yes all of that could happen and you know at this point
i 'm starting to think that might be a good thing
i got this idea during carrie 's last UNknown
check this out
it 's like an x ray and UNknown in one
so once i UNknown the UNknown and attach the probe the UNknown will do the rest
yeah it shouldn 't take longer than a couple of minutes
now i know what you 'r e wondering boy or girl ?
well she won 't tell me
marshall i don 't know !
ms UNknown ?
touch me with that thing and you die !
do you know what this is about ?
what UNknown ?
and seeing as you have no memory of the incident it 's premature to pass judgment
sydney jack if i find out you UNknown e concealed any more information from me you will feel the full weight of this office bearing down on you
that said we in too deep with the current operation
we can 't allow the covenant to get their hands on UNknown weapons
so you 'r e going back in as scheduled
i 'm withholding this information from the UNknown
that means agent vaughn that you are prohibited from discussing any of this with your wife
is that understood ?
i thought you said we need to keep this secret !
yes from the UNknown which is what we UNknown e done
you knew dixon would order vaughn to keep this from UNknown
if the UNknown found out i 'd be pulled
in time you would have come to the same conclusion
maybe yes but i wouldn 't have acted on it
the last thing i want is to be responsible for driving a wedge between vaughn and UNknown
that is a concern i do not share
how was sloane ?
you were right about before ; those details do matter ;
i shouldn 't leave them out
it 's okay
she never went to milan she was with him
well now i do
i know that you 'r e going back to a man who knows you as a different person !
if this was just about finding the covenant i might agree with you
but vaughn i have to know
where i was and who julia is
what i did
we 'r e good to go
i UNknown l talk to you when this is over
well how was milan ?
we 'r e good
just you and me ?
why did you miss me ?
you had certain specific qualities
like what ?
what you mean in UNknown ?
oh do you remember ?
we almost died in that godforsaken place
we couldn 't keep our hands off each other
i thought to myself now there is a very beautiful woman
who knows how to deceive !
you never went to milan !
no man you can 't go !
i 'm not going to just let her die !
give her a chance ! to tell me who the hell you 'r e working for !
i 'm working for myself you son of a bitch !
who 's this ! ?
it 's my UNknown
you lie to me again and i will kill you
that 's michael vaughn he 's my UNknown
oh my god that 's a picture of me
come on simon !
what you don 't believe me ! ?
i need you to UNknown to interpol UNknown immediately a criminal record with my name and photograph with at least 20 charges all of them security based
got it got it got it
security stocks or security alarm systems ?
because the alarm system you 'r e asking me to UNknown is from chicago
that 's illinois that 's the united states !
milan wasn 't gonna help us you freak !
that 's your UNknown ?
check his records
do a search for a criminal profile with someone with security related UNknown !
please would be nice
we gonna be able to do this in time ?
we 'r e doing the best we can
okay almost there one second one second
stop bouncing !
she 's good
now to get in we have to cut the power which is gonna trigger an off site security response
this gives us five minutes to get in get the package and get out
our target 's a biological agent
we UNknown l have to adjust our UNknown accordingly
but that shouldn 't change any of our plans
is your team aware of the fragile nature of the item ?
can i study these ?
i know you 'r e hiding something
when you recover the item contact me and we UNknown l exchange it for the remainder of your fee
now that 's sporting
it 's an artificial UNknown
if they combine this with the virus they stole last week they will be able to UNknown tailor a biological weapon for specific targets
a designer bomb that would be effective against only the targets they chose
i was referring to the senator your father
what about my father ?
well he knew how badly you wanted to become field rated and he thought it was too dangerous so he made sure it didn 't happen
but you knew that didn 't you ?
i know what you 'r e doing the way you UNknown people don 't do it to me
you 'r e not on the list
what are the inventory numbers ?
it UNknown l take me a minute to hack into central security
shutting the power off we have access to building three
we UNknown e got five minutes before their guards show up
julia you 'r e up
babe what 's the problem ?
standard UNknown UNknown should have worked i UNknown l need to map their security
how long will that take ?
i don 't know
i knew we couldn 't rely on her
keep your mouth shut and maybe we UNknown l walk out of here
julia three seconds
nothing i couldn 't handle
security will be here in two minutes let 's go
what 's this ?
we UNknown e a little surprise for ya
vaughn 's missing !
you 'r e scheduled to meet sydney at the UNknown point
no i am not leaving my partner !
a UNknown unit based out of barcelona has already been deployed ; you will meet sydney at the UNknown point !
this is what i meant !
he 's got cla issue equipment !
simon i swear to you this man is my UNknown !
that 's enough out of you !
julia 's with us
wait ! wait
i wanna do it
you never should have betrayed me
julia let 's move
it UNknown l take you anywhere but you have to tell me where you want to go
and even though everything s changed some things don t
i m not gonna lose you twice
if you find anything you let me know
dixon 's spoken with the UNknown ?
who 'd you talk to over there ?
i expect you to cooperate fully
no not exactly
they re not your staff mr dixon not anymore
i 'm pulling your clearance until further notice
mr UNknown i would expect nothing less from you
one of my men will escort you to a facility for questioning
in the meantime you il need to surrender all credentials and access cards
well of course you UNknown l be questioned as well
let 's not make this any harder than it has to be
it 's too late for that
i need to talk to you
right now !
sydney is in UNknown 's custody because of you !
the UNknown murder was my assignment !
sydney murdered a russian diplomat !
okay stop !
sydney is in UNknown custody not no she is in UNknown s custody
you think UNknown s UNknown ! ?
UNknown his operation is UNknown by black money
what the UNknown expects from him is results
what you 'r e suggesting is that i willfully participate in an UNknown cover up ?
no but i would have hoped you 'd be a person about this
do you know what would happen to you if it becomes known that you helped a fugitive evade the federal government ?
i 'm not concerned about myself right now
if what you 'r e suggesting is right that to learn what happened to sydney over the past two years
robert UNknown intends on having surgery performed on her which will render her brain dead why would he have me write the white house brief ?
clearly he has nothing to hide
michael for whatever reason you 'r e UNknown to this
i don 't know how long i UNknown l be gone
so i guess i UNknown l see you
jack i wanna be a part of it
if i knew what you were talking about i d refuse anyway
come on !
UNknown has to be shut down !
just the fact that you 'r e telling me this means you have something planned
damn it let me help !
if something happens to sydney
meet me in the parking garage in three minutes
what are you doin ?
were you lookin for somethin ?
if it s candy
i 'm campbell
so this contact we 'r e meeting former UNknown ?
we 'r e waiting for sloane
you called sloane on this ?
you and i will be the prime suspects behind any attempt to free sydney from UNknown custody
sloane has agreed to help us make it seem as if it were the work of the covenant
do i trust him on this ?
camp williams is a naval training facility
why would UNknown take her there ?
because it 's home to an UNknown UNknown detention center used for the interrogation of suspected terrorists whose captivity the government won 't admit to
tell the helper we UNknown l need a tactical team
at least 8 men
oh no not since the government fell
if he 's available UNknown would know
we UNknown l need to get a hold of blueprints to camp williams
the UNknown central office downtown they should have a set of blueprints on file
meet back here in three hours
i told you jack we 'd work together again
just so we 'r e clear it 's in all our best interests to make sure that no one on the hill questions our ethics UNknown
that 's why i 'm counting on you to write a thorough report UNknown our investigation to date and our fair treatment of sydney UNknown
but when we searched her flat in rome we found a UNknown message taped to the UNknown of her desk
now if she can UNknown that message it may help us UNknown or possibly even take down the covenant
what if she doesn 't recognize the code ?
as long as she UNknown a willingness to cooperate that surgery will be nothing more than a threat
ms UNknown we know you know how to read this code
do you recognize your handwriting ?
smiley faces sometimes
there 's another procedure UNknown stimulation
we can use it to find out where you UNknown e been the last two years
UNknown the text and we won 't have to
don 't bother negotiating with me !
you 'd better make sure i 'm a vegetable when you 'r e done with me
try a higher setting
in a couple of hours you UNknown l almost feel human again
you have a strong heart though
survive another five six sessions
that UNknown l be a new record for both of us
i thought i was supposed to be observing
and you will as much as possible
but my interrogation of agent UNknown includes a discussion of classified material
how can i report on an investigation i 'm not a part of ?
we can talk about it
come on !
i 'm sorry but if i 'm going to chronicle our treatment of sydney UNknown i need to see how she 's being treated
how do you suppose it was that sydney UNknown knew to flee the country before she was even aware the UNknown wanted to take her into custody ?
with plane tickets ?
that 's why you asked for me
legally you needed a witness
get to your office
it 's cold at night
they wanted to know about UNknown when i was there assigned
what do they want to know about you ?
don 't give it to UNknown m !
that 's checkmate in three moves
want to give me my fifty bucks now or do you we go through the motions ?
i UNknown e got all day
that 's not tuition money is it ?
i UNknown l put you in checkmate in ten moves
yeah if i play with my eyes closed
thomas UNknown michael vaughn
yeah he was my father
no kidding ?
well look who 's putting the band back together !
rules of engagement ?
lethal force is not an option
well if we 'r e going to use UNknown we 'r e going to need another five UNknown
it 's not going to be cheap jack two fifty k per hire
another 9 for the chopper
for the non lethal UNknown add another six
you 'r e smarter than you look
ms UNknown !
he 's a journalist you know from the middle east
story is he died in a car accident
truth is he was protecting his source
thought the first amendment would protect him
he was strong though like you
code red !
initiate UNknown procedures
hold her !
when you activate this it UNknown l lock down the security system for as long as it takes you to copy the blueprints
any word from UNknown ?
he should have the team hired and equipment by tonight as long as we 'r e successful and get the blueprints
here we go
now every incoming and UNknown call to the UNknown building will be UNknown through this number
no i can 't
all my screens just went blank
did you UNknown ?
well i UNknown e got a man in the area
i UNknown l send him over
yeah yeah i got a call
you guys down ?
jack could have taken a camera in there
they sweep him and find a camera this is all over
federal security measures require that we make a thorough search
hey i 'm new but i 'm not new alright ?
i know the protocol ?
then you know i gotta stay with you at all times
right right just give me the tools show me the way
right over here
in the meantime you might want to make sure your data files are backed up
i already did
i think it 's safe to say that you 'r e a lucky man
yes i am
terminal 12 will take us up
make the call
i UNknown e just been pulled from a meeting with the secretary of defense to find out that your branch has been dark for the past thirty minutes
yes we 'r e working on it
my supervisor 's in with the technician now
whoa son son !
and if god forbid something like that should befall us
i would expect that the central office UNknown with the management of such an emergency would be prepared
so why don 't you get your supervisor on the line right now ?
sir director UNknown 's on blue
you need to speak with him
you wait here
no we 'r e not just talking about UNknown
in case you haven 't noticed we 'r e due for another earthquake
plus because of the recent forest fire we 'r e susceptible to UNknown
not to mention the fact that there seems to be a riot breaking out every time the UNknown win
just make sure you get it done
that UNknown l do it
should be back online
director UNknown please
i just spoke with him he said he was in washington !
stop where you are !
stop where you are !
hands in the air !
get him down on the table
what is that ?
UNknown we have to dig the bullet out
if you give me morphine i UNknown l be dead before you get to the bullet
don 't get any ideas
i have to do this to keep you from thrashing
give me your belt to bite down on
oh i don 't need a belt !
just do it !
my son liked boats
what is your son 's name ?
his name was benjamin
he UNknown l recover
i didn 't know you wore glasses
only during surgery
but we 'r e still going to need security codes to get into camp williams
that 's going to be a little tricky with all the UNknown agents crawling everywhere
you 'r e starting to like me again
here 's your draft
if i was tough on you before i apologize
i 'm not naive
but that doesn 't excuse your blackmailing me by threatening to arrest my husband
yeah don 't mention van UNknown
his reputation UNknown him
just stick with UNknown
deliver this to miller
we UNknown l want you back in six hours to report on the final results
marshall if i needed you to access classified
hey check this out
now let 's say you 'r e out in the field doing and you need to get you just press this button and
nice UNknown do you UNknown ?
okay if i need you to access classified documents on the UNknown computers network can you do it ?
no i don 't have access
isn 't there any way to bypass that ?
of course it 's me
kick some UNknown booty ?
can i just say
the only thing i UNknown e come to is that would UNknown some feeling of debt on my part
as usual jack you 'r e in danger of UNknown yourself
the u s government has pardoned me for my crimes
the international community regards me as a UNknown
yet you and sydney still believe i 'm pursuing some hidden agenda
well you 'r e right about that
no UNknown endeavor can ever fill the void left by my past crimes
with the death of my wife you and sydney are my absolution my penance
you 'r e all i have left
all records pertaining to camp williams have been removed
i thought i could exercise some degree of control over the interrogation but he just wanted me to write a report UNknown the whole thing
i know you 'r e working on something
i want to help
that all depends on you
help me out syd
you son of a bitch !
leave him alone !
you can stop this by UNknown the code
i will kill you from this !
oh my god !
they 'r e coordinates
all i can tell you is what they are
west 118 degrees 17 minutes 15 3 seconds
get a team UNknown
so thanks for caring
we UNknown l have the UNknown stimulation UNknown in about an hour
and we UNknown l finally know what happened to you in the last two years
this is a UNknown UNknown
after i drill a hole in your skull
i UNknown l use it to drain the water from your UNknown
once you 'r e unconscious we UNknown l remove your UNknown and begin the UNknown stimulation
we have an operative inside who will gain access to the security room and initiate a reverse UNknown protocol thereby containing the bulk of the mps in their patrol areas
once entry is made we UNknown l proceed to the restricted UNknown where agent UNknown is being held
i hope your man on the inside knows what he 's doing
i hate to ask the obvious
what 's taking so long ?
the UNknown program has to be placed within 5 inches of the central control station
once that happens it UNknown l lock down the internal doors and open that main gate
then we move
yes sir i UNknown l check with the duty officer
says you 'r e going to write a UNknown report for us
here we go
we 'r e locked in
all the doors are sealed
what did you do ?
i got it
you 'r e all right
he 's with us
that 's what all of this was about
i didn 't know what to do
you made it sydney
travis et agent UNknown www UNknown com
ms UNknown we know you know how to read this code
UNknown the text and we won 't have to
don 't bother negotiating with me !
you 'r e all right
he 's with us
okay according to the geo UNknown UNknown position our entrance is here and here
we UNknown e gotta secure these ones
sweetheart you 'r e okay ?
how do you feel ?
you should know
i suppose i owe you a thank you
sydney as long as you 'r e alive you UNknown l never owe me a thing
not just you
have you UNknown the coordinates from the code that UNknown found in rome ?
they point to a strip of desert near the san UNknown fault
less than an hour from here
if there 's something waiting for us it 's most likely buried
i 'm going to go check it out
in the meantime we have a lead
something that might actually help us retrieve your lost memories
sydney my foundation gives grants to various UNknown
one of these men has in development a non UNknown therapy for treating long term severe amnesia
if this therapy works why didn 't you mention it before ?
well sydney until now
dad i wanna go with you
you should rest
so i was an idiot
michael tried to warn me about UNknown but
i didn 't listen
i followed the rules
where did you send them ?
i don 't know
sir we UNknown e checked the location
it 's clean
i want you to check it again
i think we UNknown e been played
don 't tell me we UNknown e been played
check it again !
then we 'r e screwed
not an unfamiliar situation
i UNknown e been through too much with him
i don 't trust that man and i still can 't believe you don 't feel the same
what i 'm feeling is irrelevant
in conspiring to save you from the UNknown
sloane 's also given us all the ammunition we 'd ever need to UNknown his pardon agreement
he 's put his life in our hands
and as far as breaking you out yours was in his
nice catch steven !
this is UNknown isn 't it ?
your children will be looked after through the duration
he ordered this ? of your custody unless you find a suitable family member
you 'r e gonna have to come with us
is this familiar to you ?
and that symbol ?
whoever that person was he made a vow to safeguard UNknown 's UNknown
when you get back you UNknown l ask marshall to run a dna test
i UNknown l return to UNknown tell him i was abducted by the covenant and that you 'r e still being held hostage
and what are we saying they want ?
how about the UNknown device ?
you 'd like that wouldn 't you ?
sydney i know what you 'r e thinking
why don 't you ask yourself if the device was so valuable to me why did i let it go ?
for your freedom
it is something the cla might believe the covenant would take in exchange for you
and once we make the exchange the device will be destroyed
no one will have it
i UNknown l contact bob UNknown and tell him that my sources have confirmed that the covenant is responsible for your break out
as soon as i hear from dr UNknown i UNknown l let you know
he 's the UNknown who works out of yale
what about you ?
we 'r e setting up a paper trail rent a cars airline tickets
there 's something else that just occurred to me
if UNknown 's to believe i was being held by the covenant there needs to be some evidence of my UNknown
i am not going to let you be beaten
i 'm the only one who 's UNknown the only one UNknown will listen to
if i don 't go back he 's gonna think i 'm a part of too
jack this is insane !
vaughn this whole situation is a problem
we need physical evidence to help sell the idea that the covenant was responsible
you should do it
just get it over with
i know how difficult this must be
that was for turning me in to UNknown
this is for helping me break out
now let 's get this over with
where 's sydney UNknown ?
you covered for her once and it cost you your job
do it again this cell will be your home for the next ten years
my lawyer 's name is shelley byrd
your only play here is to tell me where sydney UNknown is and who broke her out
was it her father ?
you are always revealed
she 's here
they just drove by and dumped her
she refused medical services
and that was the covenant 's only demand ?
we want the UNknown device
that 's what the man said
the voice ?
that sydney UNknown was taken from a black ops u s facility that somehow they took you as well
that you UNknown e since been released
and meanwhile your husband and sydney UNknown 's father are UNknown searching for a covenant cell
but sydney is depending on you making this happen
since when did you and UNknown become so close ?
or is that about sharing the same man ?
this is a woman 's life
protect it or i will report everything you UNknown e done to your superiors
need i remind you that it was your husband who helped her flee the country when she was wanted by the UNknown ?
in the wrong hands that information can be quite damaging
one more thing
the person who answers it will give you the details of the exchange
do we have a deal ?
you will be notified as to time and place
UNknown did well
you don 't have to thank me
yes i do
and has that assessment changed at all ?
this is where he works ?
i was thinking just now
i wasn 't expecting you until tuesday and
and then i realized that it is it 's tuesday and you UNknown e come to me at a really awkward time
i 'm not nearly finished so
i can 't promise you anything
still your research in memory UNknown sounds quite promising
oh yeah well that 's that 's really a trip
oh can i do you mind if i
oh she she likes to hug if you
this is UNknown
capable but she 's all about hugging
all about hugging
anyone else ?
i can 't do this
look we 'r e not here because we have other options
we live in an age of UNknown
but UNknown is only one of the many illusions of the post modern world
i don 't know anything about you except that i 'm not supposed to know anything about you
suffice to say that there are people who are under the impression that my daughter has committed a crime
her memories are the only things that can UNknown her
i see so there 's pressure pressure that the therapy should work
tell them how you got the idea
but not the long version
i began in the UNknown background in philosophy
treated head trauma patients for twelve years until one night on i 95
i became one of them a head trauma patient
i drove into the highway UNknown UNknown my pickup truck
so i spent the next eighteen months in various forms of traction
now that 's not the torture you 'd expect not moving for a year and a half
it 's UNknown oddly
our dreams are both a UNknown and a UNknown
which means that our dreams contain our memories which means there 's a shared reservoir
so i began to consider ways to consciously enter the subconscious
ways to convince the brain that it was truly UNknown the dream memory state
so i turned to the one thing that i really knew
what are the drugs ?
oh well the cocktails the happy UNknown of UNknown and UNknown
i mean it won 't kill you
but depending on what they are your dreams just might
i say we get this party started
UNknown will show you were to change
come with me
but you you 'r e going to have to become UNknown in the dream state itself
how do i do that ?
well the drugs i 'm gonna give you will do most of the work
but i will be monitoring your UNknown activity and when i know you 'r e in UNknown
i UNknown l give you a UNknown cue over the UNknown
tell me what was the last thing you remember before your missing time ?
being knocked unconscious in my apartment
well i see
it 's like it 's like using a muscle that you never used before
if you can get to that point just stay with it because ultimately you will become aware of what happened next
i don 't really understand
but it won 't necessarily be real ?
oh it will be to you !
here are your UNknown i 'm putting them on you now
and good luck
by the time i reach one you will be asleep
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
you have a mild concussion
you UNknown l be okay
we UNknown l run a UNknown scan to check for bleeding
will 's going to be okay
he 's on his way to UNknown
will 's in witness protection
this is normal UNknown in memory leading up to the injury
sydney the woman you were living with was not francie
we found a file that will was UNknown
her name was allison UNknown
you shot her
it 's coming back to you
miss you need to lay down
yeah they were listed on a UNknown yesterday as an UNknown threat
no i thought we 'd go to santa barbara first and see how that went
you 'r e not married ?
you really did hit your head huh ?
i thought you gave up on us
syd when i walked into your apartment i saw you lying there
i love you !
sydney you 'r e dreaming !
if you can hear me then you 'r e in a dream state
you need to use it to get back to where you were to get to the last memory you have
now remember you said it was in your apartment that you were knocked out
you must try to go back to that place you must try to find that place
sydney you are in control of your environment
and she exists now in actual memory
she was knocked unconscious after the fight
how can she remember anything that happened after that ?
because UNknown the mind can still establish UNknown historical accounts of the real world
meaning even with her eyes closed her other senses were alert
the barbecue chips ?
what did she say ?
uh someone without a face
it 's not that uncommon
don 't !
she 's in a UNknown
i was in a UNknown once
how nice for you
it 's all right
i don 't know how
focus on the last detail you remember
there i am
that just doesn 't happen
kill the power feed !
what the hell is happening ?
she 's in v UNknown
get the UNknown it 's on the tray
get these off her
get the UNknown UNknown
give me a break !
it 's a dream we can do whatever we want
at least i can
i assume he just told you
are those the dna results ?
but i did run some other UNknown tests and well
i hope this helps
we still don 't know who the hand belongs to
in my dream it was my birthday
i was seven
whose hand ?
yes i did
forensics analysis leads marshall to believe that whoever this hand belonged to was alive as recently as four months ago
well then it couldn 't have been UNknown because i killed him last year
unless you didn 't
it was me
UNknown was a russian diplomat
the russians must have typed his dna
UNknown 's worked with them
i UNknown l call her have her get a sample see if it 's a match
after my fight with allison these men came into the room
i couldn 't see their faces
they were wearing black
i was on a UNknown
they wheeled me through the door and
i lost them before i could see where they took me next
UNknown strangled me
it must have been a dream right ?
it 's UNknown you know
this is not an exact science
at that point in your life you had never even met UNknown
you know this would probably be a UNknown figure which is also not than uncommon by the way
masked figures UNknown
in my case a parrot
i wanna go back
they were taking me towards a room
it was room 47
i have to go back and see what was happening to me in there
you 'r e the greatest !
once you 'r e under you UNknown l most likely begin in a dream cycle
again no matter where you are try to pick up the thread of your last memory by UNknown on a detail you remember something vivid
there was hanging plastic in the building where i was taken
whatever it is you 'r e looking for a link portal back to your memory state back to the door you described
i assumed it would be with a low level agent
do you have confirmation of the covenant 's demands ?
my sources have confirmed they are holding sydney UNknown
they 'r e asking for the UNknown device in exchange for her release
this is an awkward conversation
how so ?
to use your contacts
because you can give me UNknown
i 'm looking for someone trained in UNknown
in particular dead shot with a long range rifle
i plan on making the trade
during the exchange i want sydney UNknown taken out
why make the trade ?
it 's very simple have the covenant end her life
because i want assurance that sydney UNknown is eliminated
if she 's hit by a sniper it will appear as though it 's a covenant double cross
well with all due respect mr director what guarantee do i have that this isn 't some form of UNknown ?
because i know what you 'r e up to mr sloane
i can see your big picture
i know your UNknown
i UNknown l call you with the details
the dna you UNknown e got from the kremlin
i matched it
yes which means sydney didn 't kill him
UNknown has nothing on her
she can come home
they 'r e hard to find
don 't forget the case
i 'm looking for that building
check the kitchen
she 's on track for another vivid one
you shouldn 't have come back
who are you ?
i 'm telling you you don 't want to be here
you 'r e not UNknown
i know you 'r e not UNknown
it doesn 't matter who i am
all that matters is that you leave this place
you get the hell out of my way !
i can 't do that
you are so stubborn !
you idiot !
we know the covenant had us we suspected it all along
of course we 'r e right !
it was the covenant !
we think it 's an accident we don 't remember anything ?
then what happened to me ?
trust UNknown !
that 's enough questions
pull her out now !
i 'm not going to risk her life again !
no her heart rate 's alright let 's give her a chance
oh my god !
travis et agent UNknown www UNknown com
do we have a deal ?
you will be notified as to time and place
do you have confirmation of the covenant 's demands ?
my sources have confirmed they are holding sydney UNknown
they 'r e asking for the UNknown device in exchange for her release
during the exchange
why come to me ?
because i want assurance that sydney UNknown is eliminated
your research in memory UNknown sounds quite promising
oh yeah well that 's that 's really a trip
5 4 3 2 1
oh my god !
what happened ?
i gave you a shot of UNknown 's of adrenaline
dad i have to go back there 's there 's something
you were going to UNknown again
you are not going back
i was in my old apartment i was there with will
did will say anything ?
please don 't do that
we 'r e out of here !
you 'r e not going to put her through this again
but i 'm sure that i can give you something
will knew something
wait no !
i 'm not suggesting we pull him out
i 'm suggesting we simply contact him
he knew allison
you 'd know if he knew anything
will must have been UNknown by the cla before he went into the program
not by you
see if we can get another clue to your missing time
UNknown will puts him in no danger
sydney you have to do this
you looked like you were struggling at the end
what was happening ?
dr UNknown UNknown that based on the data he UNknown
he believed the memory of your missing time has been removed
i don 't understand
but his agreement to go along with the trade seems to confirm that he 's accepted the idea that sydney is being held by the covenant
where is sydney ?
then he was helpful ?
despite the fact that he almost killed her yeah the doctor was great
the UNknown is expecting one more call from the covenant to set up the time and place for the exchange
sydney for the UNknown device
you want me to make the call representing the covenant
sydney 's life is in your hands
if you betray her i swear to you no matter what it costs me i will kill you
no need to worry agent vaughn
i love her too
let 's go get a bite to eat
you know what i UNknown e got to finish this schedule by tomorrow
where you guys going ?
UNknown 's ?
yeah i do yeah
see you later !
is there somewhere we can talk ?
will what the hell are you doing ?
sydney UNknown died in a fire two years ago
will i swear to god i 'm me !
i know about project UNknown
i know what you are !
i 'm not a double
how the hell did you find me ?
my father knows your case officer
what 's his name ?
i don 't know
will i don 't know
i didn 't talk to him
sit down on your knees !
get down !
i 'm gonna tell UNknown m you 'r e here
will you can 't do that
i 'm a fugitive
if you make that call you UNknown l burn me
oh that 's convenient !
wait okay !
ask me something ask me something obscure
when i had my job interview for the newspaper something happened to me that day
i told you about it
what was it ?
they spilled coffee on your new white shirt
you were UNknown but UNknown said it made you look like a working reporter
she gave you the job
you know that if i wanted to hurt you i could
you 'r e my best friend
you 'r e my oldest friend
i love you
oh my god !
if sydney UNknown somehow survives this i will turn over the UNknown of your extra UNknown activities to the justice department
doctor UNknown ?
i woke up in the bathtub
the place was on fire
i crawled out
the fact that i actually wasn 't dating francie that it was her double
i thought that was like the number one most insane story of all time
but yours actually tops it
she 's working with a group called the covenant
we think they 'r e the ones responsible for kidnapping me for setting the fires
you know i UNknown e always thought of myself as a UNknown
the idea of taking someone 's life is just inconceivable
but if i have a chance to kill allison
i never would have come here if i didn 't have to
are you kidding me ?
you 'r e like most beautiful thing i UNknown e ever seen
i went to see a doctor
he had this sort of dream therapy he thought might help me remember what happened to me
i was hoping you could help me make sense of it
we were sitting in my old apartment
there 's a box of cereal on the counter
the box had a name written on it something i kept seeing in the dream
yeah st UNknown was his UNknown
what was his real name ?
i never knew it
do you remember how to contact him ?
yeah he would only meet with me
you know i can go in there again go in alone
he will only meet me in person
i didn 't come here to pull you back into this
i have spent the last two years of my life pretending to be somebody that i 'm not
it 's not your fault
i didn 't see
when you made contact with st UNknown what was the protocol ?
i 'd dial a number an answering machine in UNknown
when it picked up i 'd dial a confirmation code
i 'd hang up and wait for him to call for me back
tuesday night eleven o UNknown lock
i need to know what sydney UNknown told you
you had helped her recover her memories
tell me what she found
the morphine is really good
like the old days when i
oh but don 't don 't turn it off
answer the question
she said she fought herself and then she saw her friend will
she saw will in her dream ?
no no he 'd call the witness protection division
meaning UNknown 's still alive ?
meaning i really need some more morphine
i UNknown e earned it don 't you think ?
yes it 's
those that remained UNknown provided us with only UNknown images of the men who took sydney
we ran the video through our UNknown and came up with eight possible matches
now two weeks ago one of those suspects rented an a star helicopter from a dealer in houston where he also recently purchased a warehouse downtown
we went there but the building was only being used for storage boxes of fishing equipment
it was a dead end
fishing equipment ?
the manufacturer hasn 't actually made these shells for 15 years
oh i UNknown your file
i forgot you were captured by east german intelligence agents UNknown
yeah it wasn 't your fault of course
they 'd gotten a tip that cla was on their tail
but you were unprepared
they held you for two weeks never identified you as american
where do you think she is ?
don 't do this
take them into custody now !
if st UNknown does show what am i supposed to tell him ?
that you UNknown e just been given code six clearance
that you want information about the covenant
last chance to bail out
i love this stuff
well at the moment ?
yeah i lack everything sir
so we UNknown e got no way to verify that it was actually the covenant making the demand for the trade ?
sydney UNknown means a lot to me
i just wanted your opinion
is she gonna be alright ?
i am doing everything in my power to bring this to a safe and swift conclusion
you have my word
we just met one time
another time perhaps
i wasn 't sure you 'd come
i would not have come at all except money 's something i could use
we UNknown l see what we can do about that
you should know i UNknown e been given code six clearance
and i need to know about the covenant
why are you asking me about the covenant ?
i thought that you would
how do you think i even know anything about them ?
well obviously you know something
i cannot talk about covenant
wait a minute
yes they are !
tell him julia thorne sent you
julia thorne sent me
yell out the name UNknown !
it was julia thorne
she needs to see you
she trusts you but she 's in danger
did they find it ?
i don 't know what he 's talking about
have they been to UNknown ?
need to know if
they 'r e after UNknown
how he got to UNknown what he meant what the covenant wants
but they don 't kill UNknown they UNknown him
they UNknown him they wanted him
UNknown asked if they got it
so whatever 's going on there 's a thing
yeah and there 's someone else who 's trying to find it
i mean things really don 't get any more vague than that do they ?
it 's sloane it 's obviously sloane
syd you UNknown e been going over this since the beginning of time
you UNknown l figure it out
what makes you say that ?
because you 'r e you
think that was the best move punching UNknown in the face ?
based on the comments he was making it was obvious that you and i were going to end up here no matter what we did
whether i hit him or not he wasn 't about to pass up the opportunity
we shouldn 't have let sydney go
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
i didn 't bring this up to start a petty fight
the fact is you and i have something in common
we UNknown e both suffered through the death of the woman we loved only to discover she was still alive
i know it 's hard but this isn 't about you
and i will not allow my daughter to become your mistress
if that 's where you think my concern for sydney is headed then you are even more cynical than i thought
if lightning strikes mr vaughn and you and i get to walk free again if you care about my daughter as you claim to then push her away
be cruel if you have to
make her despise you because your kindness tortures her
i can see it what it does to her
and i won 't have it
you and vaughn 's wife work together
okay how the hell did that happen ?
let 's talk about you
a beautiful painter lives in your building and you haven 't asked her out yet
let 's go back to you
okay you and vaughn 's wife
yeah i hate her
you hate her
it 's just
i 'm emotional
i UNknown e never been a depressed person
it 's you and francie
i don 't know
when and where ?
and just when i was beginning to believe the glowing press about you being such a UNknown
you 'r e a smarter man than that
who are you ?
later in life you left me 800 million dollars
should i go on ?
your inheritance was not enough ?
i know the truth and therefore i show no remorse seeing you like this
i was an UNknown by profession but a UNknown by blood
so are you
that 's wonderful spin
julian the covenant
i want to know exactly what you said to him
i UNknown l ask you one more time
what exactly did you tell the man you were meeting with ?
you wouldn 't do something like this ? !
not to your own father !
oh my god !
i UNknown e been waiting to do that for like eight years
no no !
i don 't remember
whatever it was that was hidden whatever he was talking about i obviously had it
i must have had it in UNknown
whatever i did if it was me the choices i made were my choices
oh so if you had something to hide today
where would you hide it
assume for a second that it 's information it 's data video something that can be stored
well if it 's something small it could be anywhere
i know that 's why i figure a bank or a hotel safety deposit box
how come ?
where would i hide something ?
wait a second
we 'r e going to UNknown
and you are ?
this way please
the bar is over there and the gym is on the 6th floor open 24 hours
of course you have a balcony a fantastic view
that should be it
yeah thank you for asking
you know you 'r e a lovely little man isn 't he ?
of what ?
you know what i mean ?
it was a little over the top
over the top ?
there is no over the top
plus i like champagne
i am not UNknown this
call up the on screen UNknown
you have to admit my accent was pretty good
it was like early stones
i thought it was australian
shut up !
i mean that 's good
take a look at right that 's enough carry on
let 's get past these UNknown
see if i was ever here
okay we 'r e in the system
alright what are we looking for ?
long term storage contracts
what if they don 't ?
think positively !
what about security ?
let 's move !
this is for francie
set the time and place with UNknown
i 'm ready to be traded back
sydney UNknown 's taken your father and vaughn into custody
dixon 's in custody as well
but we need to proceed with this trade as planned so that UNknown believes you were being held by the covenant
the UNknown device is being delivered in san pedro
i UNknown e hired a team to pick it up they will appear to be working for the covenant
as soon as they UNknown e left the area you 'r e to drive yourself to meet UNknown
you are never ending up with the UNknown device
i want it put inside the van and taken directly to the parking lot at hill street and 9th
i want the van to remain visible at all times
no one is to enter or exit the vehicle
sydney you have my word
that 's a relief
the UNknown device that 's being traded to the covenant it 's actually going to sloane
he needs to be watched from the moment he gets the device
grab the feed from a satellite that has a view of the trade
track their van
syd i 'm tracking the van
the package is inside
anything unusual you UNknown l let me know copy that
i 'm heading toward UNknown
wish me luck
she 's approaching the dock
UNknown 's arrived
shots gun !
man down !
i think you already know my response
let me guess
not a word
i followed your protocol precisely
this was your UNknown the whole time
now you can go on blaming me if you like or you can accept the truth
which is what ?
his team might have thought so but apparently UNknown never gave us the UNknown device
it was a setup
i don 't know what you 'r e talking about
it seems like everything is falling back into place
thank you by the way
i 'm meeting UNknown
what is that ?
it 's human tissue vital still active
you feeling alright ?
i must have dreamed about it i don 't know how many times
when you told me that she was still alive
i thought if i had the chance that ending her life would be satisfying you know there 'd be UNknown it 'd be UNknown
it 's just as empty as the dreams
it 's horrible
now that the covenant knows you 'r e still alive you might want to move again
maybe somewhere outside of the country
no i 'm not gonna run any more
i 'm gonna stay in wisconsin
i don 't know maybe when i get back i UNknown l
i UNknown l ask out that painter
we 'r e going to see each other again
i love you
i kinda like that

in the name of siegfried who was murdered and whose murder lives !
bear in mind how siegfried died !
king attilla sends me lady kriemhild to plead in his stead for your hand !
ruediger you seem to know quite well how i am exposed to grievous wrongs in the house of my clan !

he has kept faith with me i shall keep faith with him
this kriemhild is my last word !
UNknown ruediger lady kriemhild wishes to speak with you after UNknown !

not on the cross lord UNknown on the sharp edge of your sword !
my lady !

don 't you want to make peace with your family ?
no my priest
the sack of gold is mine !
the queen is coming !
let us meet her brother !
the king 's treasure !
my lady king attilla 's brother UNknown welcomes you !
ruediger choose a kingdom from my lands in gratitude for this wondrous woman !
ask king attilla UNknown ruediger if he is ready to make your oath his own !
by my head o queen whoever dares to offend you shall die a hundred deaths !
here ends the second canto
lord attilla swore to turn rome 's churches into horse stables !
why does he not fulfill his oath ?
we went into war !
why don 't we ride on ?
why is attilla 's horse UNknown to his tent ?
he sleeps !
the white woman stole and bound our lord !
she uses golden tresses as cord !
the white woman stole and bound our lord !
she uses golden tresses as cord !!
my lord !
if you would honor me and UNknown my heart then bid my brothers as guests to your court
leave for worms UNknown to invite the royal brothers of my wife as guests to our court !
here ends the third canto
for over a month your brothers stayed as guests of ruediger von UNknown
the UNknown sing a new song about the love between your brother UNknown and ruediger 's only child the beautiful UNknown !
thus UNknown and burgundy are bound together one heart one life one death !
to honor your brothers lord attilla has sent the noblest of his knights dietrich von UNknown to greet them
once more dear nibelungen before lord attilla comes to greet you
do not forget to whom attilla will lead you !
how could we forget lord that we come to visit our sister kriemhild ?
whoever wants to win my gratitude must remember my great sorrow !
on the day before summer UNknown the nibelungen arrived at attilla 's court
you must be tired from your journey
refresh yourselves and rest
king attilla remember your oath !
he who murdered siegfried is now in your hands !
remember my suffering !
hagen tronje shall duel with me for his life !
you would fight an assassin attilla ?
no have him killed !
my guest ?
on the life of your child redeem it !
in the desert where i was born there is but one thing sacred the guest !
hagen tronje shall be sacred as long as he regards the peace of my abode !
whoever brings me tronje 's head will win a shield full of gold !
but i beseech you
bard play on !
is it the fashion at worms to sit at table armed head to toe ?
lord hagen tronje knows well why he never lays aside his sword !
methinks from such a feast the heir to king attilla 's crowns should not be absent !
methinks the boy has not long to live
we scarcely shall go as guests to any courts of his !
now you nibelungen all of my men will be against you
safe conduct from these halls i demand for me and my following !
here ends the fifth canto
open the gate !
huns avenge your dead !
it is impossible my queen !
avenge your dead huns and the royal child !
hand over the assassin of siegfried and you are free !
the fight is too uneven
the dawn will see no UNknown alive
with UNknown my own child will die !
lord ruediger stay out of it !
blood cries for blood !
call ruediger !
redeem your oath !
not against hagen tronje do you send me queen but against your brothers who defend him with their lives !
ruediger you swore by the sharp edge of your sword !
UNknown is engaged to my only child !
blood cries for blood ruediger !
here ends the sixth canto
he will bring peace !
what are you bringing us father ?
tell them that if they deliver the murderer of my child they may go free !
king attilla you do not know the loyal german soul !
my oath to kriemhild is older than my oath to you !
don 't force me to break my oath !
defend yourself hagen tronje !
o sister what have you wrought !
deliver tronje to me and you are free !
rejoice in your revenge kriemhild !
dead are your young brothers
ruediger is dead
but hagen tronje who slew siegfried still lives !
throw fire into the hall !
o lord fiery arrows are raining on the hall by the queen 's order the palace is burning
lady kriemhild is right more than right !
i myself will stand at her side when the fire will flush out hagen the murderer !
thank you kriemhild !
never king attilla has my heart been as filled with love as it is at this moment
i wish to spare king gunther death in the flames
i shall offer lady kriemhild my head !
speak you nibelungen
loyalty which iron could not break will not melt in fire hagen tronje !
i call it a shame lady kriemhild that you let heroes who could not be beaten in battle perish in fire 's fury !
do you hear ?
do you hear ?
no i died when siegfried died
it is finished !
i cannot go home to my dead siegfried until every wrong has been UNknown
lord hagen here is the sword
where is the treasure ?
i swore not to betray the location of the treasure as long as one of my kings is alive !
now kriemhild nobody knows about the treasure but god and me and god is no more discreet than i !
now earth drink your fill !

thus ends the tale of siegfried
forced UNknown !
but the UNknown boy snaps it as if i 'd made a toy !
one sword he could not shatter
with UNknown 's fragments he could not taunt me if i could weld the UNknown
lf i forged it for the fearless one i 'd be UNknown for my shame !
UNknown the fearsome dragon
with the weight of his body he guards the UNknown 's gold
siegfried 's youthful strength might well destroy UNknown
he would win for me the UNknown 's ring
one sword only will suffice
only UNknown can serve my envy if swaggering siegfried UNknown it
but i can 't weld that sword !
forced UNknown !
i go on because the boy insists
he snaps it in two and UNknown me if i don 't labour for him
go for him !
get that beast out !
why a bear ?
UNknown ask for the sword !
send him off !
i am glad when you slay bears
but why bring a live beast home ?
i was looking for a better companion than the one at home
ln the depths of the forest i set my horn waking the echo
with my music i asked would a good friend UNknown me ?
out of the bushes came a bear
i preferred him to you though i 'd still like a better !
with a rope i brought him to ask for the sword
i made the weapon sharp
lts edge will delight you
what use is its edge if the steel is not firm ?
hey what worthless toy is this !
do you call this pin a sword ?
there are the bits
shall this UNknown UNknown me further ?
he UNknown of giants and of daring deeds
he wants to make weapons and praises his skill
yet when i take one in my hand
i shatter the trash !
lf the wretch were not vile
i 'd melt him with his sword the stupid old oaf !
i 'd have an end to my annoyance !
now you rave again as if mad
gross indeed is your ingratitude !
lf i give the boy anything but the best he forgets the good i UNknown e done !
will you never think of what i taught you about thanks ?
you should obey the one who has always wished you well
you don 't want to hear that again !
but surely you 'd like some food ?
i UNknown l bring some roast meat
or would you like broth ?
i boiled it well for you
meat i UNknown e roasted for myself
swallow your swill alone !
so that 's how my love is UNknown !
that 's the UNknown for my pains !
i brought you up a UNknown babe
i gave the little mite warm clothes
i brought you food and drink cherished you like my own flesh
as you grew i guarded you
i made you a couch on which to sleep
i made you toys and a UNknown horn
i UNknown to give you pleasure
with counsel i UNknown your wisdom
with knowledge i UNknown your wits
i sit at home UNknown while you roam around
for you alone in pain i pine away a poor old dwarf !
for my worry this is my reward
the boy UNknown and hates me !
much you UNknown e taught me mime and much i UNknown e learned from you
but what you most sought to teach me
i never succeeded in learning how to tolerate you !
though you bring me food loathing alone feeds me
though you make me a couch slumber is hard to come by
though you teach me to use my wits i 'd rather stay deaf and dull
as soon as i set eyes on you i see that all you do is evil
when i watch you UNknown and UNknown UNknown and UNknown
i long to seize your neck and end your blinking !
that 's how i learned to endure you
lf you 'r e so wise help me to know something i UNknown e UNknown in vain
i run into the forest to escape you
why do i always return ?
every beast is UNknown than you
the trees and birds the fish are more welcome to me
why do i return ?
lf you 'r e clever tell me that
my child that teaches you how dear i am to your heart
i can 't abide you !
your UNknown is to blame which you should curb
the young yearn and pine for their parents nest
this longing is called love
thus you too long for me
thus you too love your mime !
you must love him !
what bird is to UNknown when it feeds it in the nest before it can fly such to you my lad is sage attentive mime !
such he must be !
oh mime if you 'r e so wise explain something else to me
the birds sang happily in spring
each attracted the other
they UNknown so lovingly and never left each other
they built a nest and hatched their brood
the UNknown UNknown out and both cherished the chicks
UNknown deer also UNknown off and so did foxes and wolves
the father brought food to the nest
the mother UNknown the UNknown
there i learned what love was
i never took cubs from the mother
where have you your loving wife that i may call her mother ?
what 's wrong with you fool ?
are you a bird or a fox ?
you brought up the UNknown babe gave the little mite warm clothes
but how came the UNknown to you ?
did you make me without a mother ?
you must believe i am both your father and your mother
you lie loathsome loon !
the young look like their parents
i UNknown e seen it for myself
when i came to the brook
i saw the trees and beasts UNknown there
sun and clouds just as they are appeared in the stream
there too i saw my own picture
quite unlike you i seemed as like as a toad and a fish
but fish never had toad for father
you 'r e UNknown rubbish !
look it becomes clear to me what i UNknown e long UNknown in vain
when i run to escape you how is it i return ?
from you i must first discover who my father and mother are ?
what father ?
by gentleness i learn nothing !
i 'd scarcely have learnt speech had i not UNknown it from you !
out with it scoundrel !
who are my father and mother ?
you UNknown e almost killed me !
then learn what you want to know as i know it !
ungrateful cruel boy !
i am not your father nor of your family yet you owe me everything
you are a stranger to me
out of compassion i sheltered you
fool i was to hope for thanks !
one day a woman lay whimpering out there in the wild woods
i helped her into the cave
to tend her by my fire
ln her womb she carried a child
UNknown she here gave it birth
back and forth she UNknown
i helped as best i could
great was her distress
she gave you into my keeping
gladly i cared for the child
what trouble mime took
now why am i called siegfried ?
your mother commanded me so to call you
as siegfried you would be strong and handsome
i gave the little mite warm clothes
now what was my mother 's name ?
truly i scarcely know
her name !
has it slipped my mind ?
no wait !
i cherished you like my own flesh
now what was my father called ?
i never saw him
she said that he was killed
to my care she entrusted her child
as you grew i guarded you well
i made you a couch on which to sleep
stop that endless squawking !
lf i must believe this story then let me see some proof
what would convince you ?
my ears do not believe you
i UNknown l credit only my eyes
what proof supports your story ?
your mother gave me this
for my pains and attention she left this as UNknown payment
look here a shattered sword !
she said your father carried it when he fell in his last fight
and these fragments you must forge for me
then my rightful sword i UNknown l UNknown !
get up mime !
now show your skill if you can !
don 't trick me with UNknown toys
only in these fragments have i faith
lf you join them badly if you patch the steel poorly
i UNknown l have your cowardly hide i UNknown l teach you what a UNknown is !
for this very day i swear
i must have that sword !
what do you want with it today ?
to go from the forest into the world never to return !
how glad i am to be free
nothing UNknown me !
far away i shall be at home
your hearth is not my house my shelter not your roof
happy as the fish in UNknown free as the finch flying off
i flee from here UNknown like the wind over the woods
never to see you again !
away he storms !
to my old troubles is added a new one
now i am at my wits end
how can i help myself ?
how can i hold him here ?
how shall i lead him to UNknown 's lair ?
how shall i join the UNknown of this stubborn steel ?
no fire can fuse these pure pieces
no hammer can UNknown their hardness
UNknown hatred trouble and toil
will not knit UNknown for me !
greeting wise smith !
grant the hospitality of your house and hearth
who seeks me out in this wood ?
who trailed me through the forest ?
the world calls me wanderer
widely have i wandered far over the earth 's face
then be on your way and do not dally here
good men have granted me haven
many have greeted me with gifts
only UNknown fear misfortune
much i UNknown e UNknown and much i UNknown e learned
and from many UNknown off doubts
that UNknown their hearts
i want to be alone
i let UNknown go their way
many imagined they were wise but knew not what they needed
i let them ask for guidance and gave my counsel as UNknown
many store useless knowledge
let me direct the sage on his way !
here i sit and stake my head as pledge in a war of wits
my head is yours
how can i rid me of this spy ?
i must ask UNknown questions
i will hold your head against my hospitality
now redeem it with your wisdom !
three questions i shall freely ask
thrice then must i answer
far over the earth 's face have you wandered
ln the earth 's depths dwell the UNknown
UNknown is their land
UNknown once ruled as their lord
a magic ring UNknown
a UNknown of treasure which they UNknown up should have won him the world
what is your second question ?
much wanderer have you told me of the earth 's dark UNknown
now answer me which race dwells on the earth 's face ?
on the earth 's face UNknown the race of giants
UNknown is their land
they won the treasure UNknown and with it gained the ring
about it strife UNknown up between the brothers
UNknown was slain
now the third question
now tell me
ln the cloudy heights live the gods
UNknown is their dwelling
UNknown rules over them
though the trunk wither never shall the spear decay
with it UNknown UNknown the world
treaties with symbols of trust he carved in its shaft
custody of the world lies in the spear of UNknown 's fist
before him bowed the UNknown
his commands UNknown the giants
they all forever obey the lord of the spear
now tell me UNknown dwarf did i know the answers ?
am i free to keep my head ?
you have solved the questions and UNknown your head
now wanderer go on your way !
you should have asked me what you needed to know
my head stood UNknown for my answers
as you do not know what you need
i claim yours as pledge
you did not greet me as a guest
i gave my head into your hands so as to enjoy your hospitality
yours now is forfeit if you do not solve three questions
so mime sharpen your wits !
long ago i left my native land
long ago i emerged from the womb
UNknown 's eyes fell on me and UNknown into my cave
before him my wit melts away
but now i must show myself wise
wanderer ask on !
now worthy dwarf
little have i heard of heroes kin yet i can answer your question
the UNknown are the children that UNknown UNknown and cherished but also UNknown
UNknown and UNknown were UNknown by UNknown wild and desperate twins
from them sprang siegfried strongest UNknown of the UNknown
did i keep my head ?
rightly you name the race
you seem UNknown scoundrel !
you are free of the first question
now for the second
what sword must siegfried flourish fit for UNknown 's death ?
UNknown is the trusty sword
UNknown thrust it into an ash tree
it would UNknown whoever could draw it forth
none of the heroes could succeed
only UNknown was victorious
now a smith keeps the pieces
he knows that only with UNknown 's sword will a brave but stupid boy siegfried slay the dragon
do i keep my head ?
you are the UNknown of wise men
who could equal your cleverness ?
but if you are so crafty as to exploit the young hero let me threaten you with the third question !
tell me UNknown smith who will weld the UNknown of the sword UNknown ?
my head swims !
accursed steel would i had not stolen it !
it has nailed me down in misery !
UNknown and UNknown are of no avail !
the UNknown smith knows of no way !
who shall shape the sword if my skill is insufficient ?
how can i work this miracle ?
three questions you had to set
three times i replied correctly
you asked about remote things
but what lay closest did not occur to you
now when i guess it you go insane
i have won your UNknown head !
now UNknown 's conqueror
shall forge UNknown anew
i leave it forfeit to him who has never learnt fear !
loathsome light !
what is flashing
what is rustling there ?
it rumbles and roars and rushes this way !
it 's making for me through the wood
a monstrous UNknown UNknown for me
the dragon is after me !
how goes it with the sword ?
where has the smith got to ?
mime you coward !
are you alone ?
the sword ?
only one who has never felt fear
shall forge UNknown anew
will you tell me ?
or must i help ?
where can i turn for help ?
i have UNknown away my head
i UNknown it to him who has never learnt fear
are you trying to escape me ?
i would gladly flee one who knows what fear is
that i failed to teach the boy !
i forgot the one good thing
he should have learnt to love me
but alas that went wrong !
how can i UNknown fear into him ?
well must i help ?
what have you done today ?
i was sunk in thoughts of how to teach you something important
you had sunk under the seat
what did you find there ?
i learned what fear was that i might teach it to you
what is this about fear ?
have you never known it ?
yet you seek to set forth into the world
what use is the UNknown sword if fear remains foreign to you ?
are you inventing idle advice ?
i repeat your mother 's advice
i must do what i promised not to let you go until you had learnt fear
lf it 's a craft why don 't i know it ?
what is this about fear ?
have you never felt in the gloomy forest when twilight falls in some dark spot when from afar there 's a rustling a rumbling roaring nearer confused flames
whirling and UNknown towards you
did you not feel a grim horror grip your limbs
UNknown UNknown shake you
lf you UNknown e not yet felt that fear is still a stranger !
very peculiar that must be !
firm and strong is my heart
this shivering and UNknown UNknown and UNknown UNknown hammering and beating
i long for this pleasure !
but how can you bring it me ?
how could you teach me ?
just follow me
i found out while thinking
i know an evil dragon which has devoured many men
UNknown will teach you fear if you follow me to his lair
where lies his lair ?
UNknown it is named east on the forest 's fringe
then not far from the world ?
it is quite near
i UNknown l learn fear and be off into the world !
the sword ?
no craft can UNknown its spell
one who knows no fear might acquire the art more easily
this UNknown fills me with UNknown
he should confess he 's a UNknown
he lies and cheats his way out !
bring the pieces here and be off !
my father 's blade UNknown me well
i UNknown l forge the sword myself !
had you acquired the craft you might have managed it
but you were always lazy
how will you do it UNknown ?
can pupil do what master cannot even if attentive ?
now go away and don 't interfere or you UNknown l be in the fire too !
what are you doing ?
take the UNknown i UNknown e been preparing
take that mush away !
i can 't fire a sword with pulp !
you 'r e filing the file smooth ruining the UNknown
you UNknown l splinter the steel
i must see it split into shreds
what 's broken i will mend
no expert can help here i see
only his folly helps the fool !
how hard he works !
the steel is in shreds yet he 's at ease
i 'm as old as the woods but never have i seen the like before !
he 's succeeding i can see
he 's UNknown UNknown it anew
the wanderer knew it well
how can i hide my head ?
it will fall to the boy if UNknown does not teach him fear !
woe is me !
damned dilemma !
what is this sword called that i UNknown e split into UNknown ?
UNknown is the name of the sword
your mother told me so
UNknown trusty sword !
now i UNknown e UNknown your UNknown
ln the UNknown i cook the UNknown
blow bellows !
wild grew a tree that i UNknown in the forest
i burned the ash tree to charcoal that now is UNknown on the hearth
how bravely burns the charcoal from the tree
how bright and brilliant it UNknown !
it spits out showers of sparks
it UNknown the UNknown of my steel
he UNknown l forge the sword and slay UNknown
i can see that clearly
the treasure and the ring will fall to him
how can i retrieve his gains ?
by cunning i UNknown l UNknown both and keep my head unharmed
when he is weary from the dragon a drink will refresh him
from UNknown i have gathered i will brew a draught for him
he needs but a few drops and he will sink into sleep
with the sword he won
i will remove him and win the ring and treasure for myself
UNknown trusty sword !
you swim in your own sweat
how do you like my subtle wit ?
have i found a way to peace ?
soon i will swing you as my sword !
lnto the water flowed a fiery flood
ln fury it UNknown
firm and UNknown is the steel
soon it will draw hot blood !
now sweat once more so that i can weld you
what is he doing with that pot ?
while i 'm melting steel are you cooking stew ?
a smith has been put to shame
a pupil teaches his master
the old man is done with his craft and serves the boy as cook
while he UNknown broth from metal the old man boils soup from these eggs
the craftsman is learning cooking
he 's lost his taste for UNknown
i have smashed all his swords
i won 't touch what he cooks
he wants to lead me to fear
a stranger must teach me
the best mime can do brings nothing home to me
he succeeds in UNknown everything !
hammer shape me a sturdy sword !
your blue blade once ran red and UNknown with UNknown UNknown
UNknown you laughed and licked the hot blood cool !
now you are flushed with the fire
your hardness UNknown to my hammer
UNknown you shower sparks on me because i tamed your UNknown !
he 's UNknown himself a sword to slay UNknown the dwarf 's foe
i UNknown e UNknown a draught to trap siegfried when UNknown falls
my cunning must succeed !
my reward must smile on me !
hammer shape me a sword !
i rejoice to see those joyous sparks
the force of fury UNknown the brave
UNknown you laugh to me though you look grim
with fire and hammer i UNknown e done well
with blows i UNknown e beaten you straight
now let your shame shrink away
be as cold and hard as you can
the ring my brother wrought on which he laid a spell the shining gold that makes one master i have won !
UNknown who thrust me in UNknown i now can compel to UNknown
i shall go there again as lord of the UNknown
the despised dwarf will be revered !
to my UNknown will come god and hero
at my nod the world will kneel !
at my wrath it will tremble !
UNknown trusty sword !
my toil is over !
you were broken
others will make wealth for him
the steel snapped for my dying father
his living son fashioned it anew
now its UNknown smiles at him
lts edge cuts UNknown
UNknown trusty sword !
you lay dead in fragments
now you gleam glorious and UNknown
lucky mime !
ln the forest at night
i watch over UNknown
are you dawning there ?
what gleam of light is that ?
nearer UNknown a bright ray racing like a shining horse breaking through the wood
ls the dragon 's destroyer at hand ?
ls it he who is to slay UNknown ?
the light fades
to UNknown i come by night
whom do i UNknown in the darkness ?
you dare to show yourself here ?
what do you want ?
begone out of my path you shameless thief !
UNknown are you lurking here ?
are you guarding UNknown 's lair ?
are you searching for mischief ?
do not UNknown here !
enough fraud has soaked our soil in distress
so leave us now in peace !
i came to watch not to act
who would bar my path ?
you who suggest UNknown schemes !
were i to oblige you by being as stupid as when you caught me how easy it would be to rob me of the ring again !
with my treasure you paid your debts
my ring UNknown the giants for their toil in building your castle
what you promised them
you dare not snatch back from the giants
what you paid them
ln your hands the stout staff would crumble to dust !
no written treaty of trust
bound you villain to me
my spear UNknown you
how boldly you threaten !
yet how fearful you are at heart !
doomed to death by my curse is he who guards the treasure
who shall inherit it ?
will the envied treasure again belong to the UNknown ?
that UNknown you with concern !
for if i grasp it again
unlike the stupid giants
then tremble guardian of heroes !
i will storm UNknown 's heights with UNknown 's hosts
then i shall rule the world !
your intent i know full well
but it does not trouble me
let him who wins the ring be its master
how UNknown you speak of what i clearly know !
your defiance depends on heroes sons dearly descended from your own blood
have you not reared a boy who will pluck the fruit that you dare not touch ?
do not quarrel with me but with mime
your brother brings you danger
he is leading here a lad who must kill UNknown for him
he knows nothing of me
the UNknown is using him for his own ends
so i say friend do exactly as it suits you !
heed my words
but mime will tell him
will you keep your hands off the UNknown ?
whom i love i leave to fend for himself
he stands or falls but is his own master
i avail myself only of heroes
am i UNknown with mime alone for the ring ?
besides you only he UNknown the gold
and yet i shall not gain it ?
a hero is approaching to rescue the treasure
two UNknown crave for the gold
UNknown who guards the ring falls
he who UNknown it has won it
would you know more ?
there lies the dragon
i will wake him for you
UNknown dragon waken !
would he really let me have it ?
who disturbs me from my sleep ?
someone has come to warn you of danger
he will save your life if you will repay him with the treasure that you guard
what does he want ?
waken UNknown !
i am hungry for him
bold is the boy 's strength
sharply cuts his sword
give me the ring as reward and i will prevent the fight
you can watch over your UNknown and live long in peace
here i lie and here i hold
let me sleep !
but call me a rogue no more
pay heed to this counsel !
everything goes its own way
you can alter nothing
take a strong stand
more than that
away he rides on his steed leaving me to care and scorn
well laugh then you frivolous crew of gods !
i shall see you all UNknown
so long as the gold UNknown
a knowing one keeps watch
his UNknown will outwit you
we UNknown e reached the spot
stop here !
you have led me far
a whole night we have wandered in the woods
now mime you must leave me to myself
lf i do not learn here i UNknown l go further alone
at last i shall be free of you !
believe me dear boy if you do not learn fear here you will scarcely find it elsewhere
do you see that dark cave mouth ?
ln it dwells a savage dragon
he is enormously fierce and huge
a hideous UNknown UNknown open
the brute may gobble you up hair and hide
it would be good to close his UNknown
then i won 't be bitten
a poisonous UNknown pours from it
lf you are UNknown with it your flesh and bones waste away
so that his venom shan 't harm me i UNknown l keep to the side
a serpent 's tail he UNknown about
lf it UNknown you tight your bones will break like glass
to protect myself from the serpent 's tail
i UNknown l keep my eyes on the brute
tell me this !
a ferocious cruel heart
the dragon 's lies there too
now is fear coming on you ?
i UNknown l thrust UNknown into his heart !
ls that what 's called fear ?
ls that all you can teach me ?
then be on your way
here i shan 't learn fear
you must see the dragon itself !
your senses will reel !
when your sight UNknown and your heart UNknown with fear in your breast then you UNknown l thank me and remember how mime loves you
you 'r e not to love me !
out of my sight !
leave me alone !
that UNknown and blinking when shall i see them no more ?
i UNknown l lie down by the spring there
you stay here
it will crawl from its cave then turn by here to drink at the stream
lf you wait at the spring
i UNknown l let the dragon go there
i UNknown l thrust UNknown into him only after he 's UNknown you down too
take my advice
after the fight you would not forbid me to bring you refreshment ?
call if you need advice or if fear UNknown you
siegfried and UNknown if they 'd only kill each other !
he 's not my father
how glad i am of that !
now i can enjoy the cool woods
at last daylight smiles on me now that he has left me and i need never see him again
what did my father look like ?
for if mime had a son wouldn 't he be the image of mime ?
as ugly UNknown and grey UNknown and UNknown with UNknown ears and UNknown eyes
away with him
but what did my mother look like ?
i can 't imagine that at all
like the UNknown deer 's surely shone
her soft UNknown eyes
when she bore me in sorrow
why did she die ?
do all men 's mothers die of their sons ?
that would be sad indeed !
ah if i could see my mother
a mortal woman !
do you live in this forest ?
lf i understood its song it would surely say something perhaps about my mother
a UNknown dwarf told me that one could come to follow bird talk
how could that be possible ?
lf i attend to its tune i UNknown l be singing its language
and understand what it says
that doesn 't sound right
the song doesn 't go on my pipe
little bird i 'm too stupid
it 's not easy to learn from you
now i 'm quite shamed
it looks at me and hears nothing
on that reed i could do nothing
you shall have a UNknown tune
i can play a cheerful one
with it i called for a comrade
nothing better has come than wolf and bear
now let me see what it brings
perhaps a dear companion ?
my strains have UNknown something lovely !
you 'd make a pretty playmate !
what 's that there ?
lf you know how to speak perhaps i can learn from you ?
here is one who does not know fear
can he come to know it from you ?
ls this UNknown ?
but i UNknown l stab you if you don 't teach me fear
i wanted a drink
a delicious UNknown you display
teeth laughing in a dainty muzzle !
i 'd like to close your UNknown
your jaws UNknown too wide !
they are not suited to chatter
but my throat is made to gulp you
ho ho !
but it seems right and proper that you should die the death
on guard UNknown !
who are you bold boy
that have pierced my heart ?
who UNknown your childish courage
to this deadly deed ?
your brain did not conceive what you have carried out
there is much i still don 't know not even who i am
you yourself UNknown me to engage you in mortal combat
you bright eyed boy
i will tell you whom you have murdered
of the UNknown race of giants
UNknown and UNknown the brothers
both now are dead
i dealt death to UNknown
he who defended the UNknown as a dragon
UNknown last of the giants
has fallen to a fresh faced hero
keep a sharp watch UNknown boy
he who prompted you in your blindness to this deed
is now plotting your death
mark how it will end !
heed my words !
ln your death you seem wise
you will know from my name
i am called siegfried
then lead me my living sword !
lts blood burns like fire !
it seems almost as if the birds were speaking to me !
did the taste of blood affect me ?
that rare bird there what says its song ?
the UNknown 's treasure now belongs to siegfried !
now he will find the UNknown in the cave !
the UNknown will help him perform wondrous deeds
but the ring would make him ruler of the world !
thanks bird for your counsel !
i UNknown l gladly follow your call !
where are you UNknown so UNknown ?
accursed brother as if i need you !
villain are you greedy for my gold ?
get away !
what i achieved shall not UNknown me
did you rob the rhine of gold ?
did you cast the spell on the ring ?
who made the UNknown ?
did you devise it ?
what do you know of the black art ?
the ring put your skill at my service
where is the ring ?
the giants took it from you
what you lost my UNknown will gain
would you cling to what the boy won ?
the lad is its lord !
he can pay me now for UNknown him
i UNknown e waited long for my wages
for UNknown the boy does the slave claim to be king ?
more right has a dog than you
never shall you gain the ring
keep it !
i UNknown l trade it for my UNknown
we thus share the spoils
share with you ?
i 'd never sleep safe
not share ?
will you leave me nothing ?
not a jot !
i will call siegfried and his sword
the boy will humble you brother !
turn round !
he has the UNknown !
and the ring !
i UNknown l soon win it for myself
yet it shall belong at last only to its master !
what use you are i don 't know
i took you from the pile of gold because i had good advice
let your beauty serve as witness
the trinkets will be a reminder that i vanquished UNknown though i still haven 't learnt fear !
he must not trust treacherous mime !
let siegfried listen to the villain 's lying words !
he can now understand what mime is thinking
the taste of blood affected him so
he is reckoning his prize 's value
did a wanderer UNknown the boy with crafty talk and tales ?
doubly scheming must i be
i UNknown l set the UNknown snare to fool the boy with friendly UNknown words
i UNknown e not yet found a teacher
but didn 't you kill the dreaded dragon ?
wasn 't it a fearful fellow ?
grim and spiteful as it was its death grieves me since more evil villains still live unpunished !
more than the dragon do i hate
the one who bade me kill it !
ln eternal sleep i UNknown l soon close your eyes !
what i desired of you you have done
now all i need is to steal the spoils from you
i think i can succeed in that
you 'r e very easy to deceive
so you 'r e planning to harm me ?
why did i say so ?
you and your kind have i always hated in my heart
from love i reared you not you nuisance
the gold in UNknown 's keeping was what i UNknown for
lf you don 't give it to me gladly
i rejoice to hear that you hate me
but must i pay you with my life ?
that 's not what i said !
you mistake my words !
you are tired from your efforts
your body must be burning
ln trying to refresh you
i did not delay
drink it now and i will win your sword helmet and treasure
so you would steal my sword and what it earned ring and booty ?
why must you mistake me ?
do i UNknown ?
open your ears !
here drink this draught !
my drinks often refreshed you when you were UNknown
whatever i brought
how has this been made ?
just drink it
your limbs will be stretched out
as you lie there i could take and hide the booty
but if you woke up i 'd nowhere be safe even with the ring
with the sword you made sharp
i UNknown l hack off the boy 's head and have peace and the ring !
you want to slay me as i sleep ?
want what ?
i only want to hack off the boy 's head
even if i didn 't hate you so and hadn 't to avenge your UNknown and the shame of my labour
how else could i seize the spoil since UNknown also is after it ?
now my UNknown wolf 's son !
drink and choke yourself to death !
you UNknown l never taste another drop !
taste my sword UNknown !
UNknown has settled envy 's wages
for that i had to forge it
lie here in the UNknown on the treasure !
with plotting and UNknown you pursued it
now you can be lord of its UNknown !
a guardian i will also give you to protect you from thieves
lie there UNknown dragon !
guard the treasure
may you both now find rest !
i am hot from my task
a fire races through my blood
my hand on my head burns
the sun is high
i UNknown l seek shade under the lime tree
once more little bird since we disturbed you
i 'd like to listen to your song
on the branch i see you swaying
UNknown and UNknown your brothers and sisters surround you with love
but i am so alone
i have no brothers or sisters
my mother is dead
my sole companion was a UNknown dwarf
kindness never UNknown into love
UNknown he set UNknown for me
at last i was forced to kill him !
friendly bird i ask you now
will you grant me a good companion ?
will you advise me UNknown ?
often have i sought but never succeeded
you will surely do better
you UNknown e advised me so well already
now sing !
now i know a wife for him
on a rocky height she is sleeping
fire surrounds the spot
UNknown would be his !
o lovely song !
how UNknown it UNknown my heart !
what shoots so swiftly through my senses ?
tell me sweet friend !
UNknown in grief i sing of love
from woe i weave my lay
only lovers know its meaning !
it drives me forth rejoicing out of the forest to the rocks
tell me lovely singer shall i break through the fire ?
can i waken the bride ?
the bride can never be won
nor UNknown awakened by a coward
only by one who knows no fear !
the stupid boy who knows not fear little bird that is l !
this very day i UNknown UNknown to learn fear from UNknown
now i burn with longing to learn it from UNknown
how can i find the way to the mountain ?
the way will be shown me then
wherever you fly i UNknown l follow !
waken UNknown !
i summon you
i sing so that you will waken
from brooding sleep
i have UNknown from the sleep of wisdom
who has UNknown my slumber ?
i am the UNknown and used spells to rouse from afar what sleep held fast
i have roamed the world wandering widely in quest of knowledge
to win world old wisdom
none is wiser than you
to you is known what the depths hide what links mountain and valley air and water
wherever life exists your breath stirs
wherever brains brood your mind is involved
everything it is said is known to you
and so in quest of knowledge
my sleep is dreaming
but while i sleep the UNknown are awake
they weave the rope and spin what i know
why not ask the UNknown ?
UNknown to the world spin the UNknown
nothing can they alter or UNknown
but from your wisdom i would be glad to learn how to hold back a rolling wheel
my mind grows misty with the deeds of men
even i with all my wisdom once was overcome by a conqueror
to UNknown i bore a wish maiden
heroes from the battlefield he bade her bring him
she is brave and also wise
why do you wake me
and not seek enlightenment from UNknown 's and UNknown 's child ?
you mean the UNknown the maid UNknown ?
she UNknown the father of storms in his might
what he longed to do but restrained himself against his will
the UNknown girl dared to accomplish herself
the father punished the maid
ln her eyes he pressed slumber
on the fell she is fast asleep
the consecrated one will waken
only when a man UNknown her for his wife
how would it help to question her ?
i am confused since i awoke
wildly and UNknown the world UNknown !
the UNknown the UNknown 's child suffered the UNknown of sleep while her UNknown mother slept ?
does he who taught defiance punish defiance ?
ls he who is responsible for the deed UNknown when it is done ?
does he who UNknown the right and preserves vows banish right
and rule by perjury ?
let me descend again
i will not let you go mother for magic lends me might
UNknown you once thrust the thorn of anxiety into UNknown 's heart
with fear of a shameful end your knowledge filled him so that fear UNknown his spirit
since you are the world 's wisest woman
tell me how the god can conquer his cares ?
you are not what you call yourself
wild and stubborn why do you disturb the UNknown 's sleep ?
you are not what you believe
the earth mother 's wisdom is drawing to an end
your wisdom will wither before my will
do you know UNknown 's will ?
to you unwise one i address these words so that you may sleep carefree for ever
fear of the gods downfall grieves me not since i will it so !
what once i resolved in despair
now i will freely perform
though in fury i flung the world to the UNknown 's envy now to the valiant UNknown
i leave my heritage
rejoicing in love innocent of envy his ability will UNknown UNknown 's curse for fear remains foreign to him
UNknown whom you bore me will awaken to the hero
the child of your wisdom will do the deed that will redeem the world
so now sleep on close your eyes
ln dream behold my downfall !
whatever now UNknown to the ever young the god gladly UNknown
descend UNknown !
away to endless sleep !
there i see siegfried coming
my bird has flown away !
with flight and sweet song it pointed out my path
now it has vanished
i UNknown l continue further on the way my guide showed me
which way youth does your path lead ?
i seek a rock surrounded by fire
there sleeps a woman i want to wake
who told you to seek the rock ?
who made you yearn for the woman ?
a forest UNknown told me
it gave me the good news
a bird may chatter but no one can understand it
how could you make sense of it ?
that was the effect of a dragon 's blood
i killed it at UNknown
scarcely had it stung my tongue than i understood bird talk
lf you slew this giant who induced you to face the fearful dragon ?
mime a deceitful dwarf led me
he wished to teach me fear
but the dragon UNknown the sword stroke which slew it
who made the sword so solid that it UNknown so strong a foe ?
i forged it myself
but who made the UNknown which you forged ?
how do i know ?
i only knew i had to forge the sword UNknown
i think so too !
why do you laugh at me ?
old gossip don 't keep me longer chatting here !
lf you can show the way say so lf you can 't hold your tongue !
patience my lad !
that 's not bad !
all my life an old man stood in my way
i swept him aside
why do you wear so big a hat ?
why does it hang over your face ?
that is the wanderer 's way when he walks against the wind
but under it an eye is missing !
doubtless someone struck it out whose way you barred
now be off or you might lose the other too
i see my son you know nothing
but you do know how to get your way
with the eye which is missing you are looking at the one
that remains to me for sight
you make me laugh !
but i can 't chatter any longer
quick show me the way
then be off on yours
there 's nothing else i need
speak or i UNknown l chase you !
lf you but knew me insolent youth
you would spare me your insults !
your threats distress me who am so close to you
i have always loved your radiant race
but my fury also gave you cause for fear
you that i love glorious hero
do not rouse my wrath today
it would ruin both you and me !
do you stay dumb ?
give ground for that way i know leads to the sleeping woman
so said my bird that flew away in haste
it flew to save itself !
the lord of the UNknown is here
woe to it if they catch it !
you shall not take the way it showed !
you forbid me !
fear the guardian of the rock !
my might UNknown the sleeping maid
he who wakes her he who wins her UNknown me of my power !
a sea of fire flows round the woman
glowing flames lick all round the rock
he who UNknown for her as bride must front the fiery fury
look up to the heights !
do you see the light ?
the blaze is spreading
a sea of light UNknown your head
soon the raging fire will consume you
go back rash boy !
go back yourself UNknown !
i must go to the heart of the blaze to UNknown
lf you do not fear the fire my spear must bar your way
my hand still holds UNknown
the sword you bear once shattered on this shaft
then let it break again on the eternal spear !
have i found here my father 's foe ?
how glorious that revenge is in my grasp !
flourish your spear !
forward then !
with his spear in UNknown has the coward escaped me ?
wondrous glow !
i will bathe in the fire in the fire find my bride !
now i can win a companion !
blessed solitude on the sunny summit !
what lies there asleep in the shadow of the pines ?
a steed sunk deep in sleep !
what is that shining in my face ?
a glittering suit of steel ?
are my eyes still dazzled by the flames ?
shining armour shall i pick it up ?
ah there 's a man in the armour !
how delighted i am at the sight !
does the helmet UNknown his head ?
it would be lighter if i UNknown his gear
oh how beautiful !
the face of the radiant sun UNknown through the clouds !
his breast UNknown as he breathes
shall i cut his UNknown ?
come sword UNknown the iron !
that 's no man !
a UNknown spell UNknown my heart
fiery anxiety fills my eyes
my senses swim and swoon !
whom can i call on to help me ?
but when she opens them
will the sight dazzle me ?
am i bold enough to dare ?
could i bear their brightness ?
all about me UNknown and UNknown and reels !
a painful yearning sears my senses
my hand trembles on my beating heart !
ls this fear ?
a woman lies asleep
how can i conquer this fear ?
how can i take courage ?
i must waken the maid so that i myself may awake !
sweetly UNknown her rosy mouth
how its soft trembling UNknown my fear !
then i will suck life from those sweet lips
though i die in doing so
hail to thee sun !
hail to thee light !
hail to thee glorious day !
long have i slept
i forced my way through the fire around the rock
i UNknown your helmet
hail to thee gods !
hail to thee world !
hail to thee UNknown earth !
my sleep is at an end
i am awakened and can see !
it is siegfried who has UNknown me
hail to the mother that bore me !
hail to the earth that UNknown me !
that i can see those eyes whose light now delights me !
o siegfried !
you were my thought
even before you were born my shield protected you
so long have i loved you !
then my mother did not die ?
was she i love only asleep ?
dearest child !
i am your very self
if you make me happy in your love
what you do not know
i know for you
how beautiful is her wondrous song though its sense seems strange
the light of your eyes is bright to my sight
the stirring of your breath feels warm
the sound of your voice is sweet
but what you say
you have UNknown me with fears
you alone have taught me anguish
you have me in powerful bonds but no longer deprive me of my courage !
i see UNknown there my trusty steed
how happily he UNknown he who was asleep like me !
siegfried woke him with me
my gaze UNknown on your heavenly mouth
my lips burn in thirst to seek refreshment in the pasture of your eyes
i see the shield there that sheltered heroes
there i see the helmet that protected my head
no longer do they shield or protect me !
a wondrous maid has pierced my heart
a woman has wounded me
i came without shield or helmet !
i see the UNknown 's steel
a sharp sword cut it in two
from my body it stripped the defences
i am exposed and unprotected defenceless a weak woman !
through blazing fire i forced my way to you !
no UNknown protected me
my blood leaps in a blaze of passion
a consuming fire is UNknown in me
the flames round UNknown 's rock now burn within my breast !
o woman quench those flames !
still the UNknown fire !
no god ever came so close to me !
heroes bowed before my UNknown
UNknown i came from UNknown !
woe is me !
he who woke me has wounded me
he cut off my UNknown and helmet
i am UNknown no more !
to me you are still the dreaming maid
i have not yet broken UNknown 's sleep
awaken for me be a woman !
my senses swoon my reason reels
must my wisdom wither ?
did you not sing to me that your wisdom was
the light leading your love to me ?
UNknown darkness clouds my sight
my eyes dim
terror UNknown and UNknown up
night UNknown your confined eyes
dread disappears as UNknown fall
emerge from darkness and see
the day shines bright in the sun !
bright in the sun shines the day of my shame !
o siegfried !
life of the earth !
laughing hero !
do not come to me inflamed by UNknown !
do not overcome me with force
do not destroy your beloved !
have you seen your reflection in the stream ?
did it not UNknown your gaze ?
had you stirred the water into waves the surface would have been disturbed and you would have seen yourself no more only the rocking of the waters
so do not touch me !
do not upset me !
ever happy will you then smile out of my eyes into yours
a gay and joyous hero !
o siegfried !
do not destroy what is your own !
i love you
i am no more my own
were you but mine !
a glorious flood flows before me
with all my senses i see only that sweet UNknown sea
lf it breaks my reflection i burn to cool my glowing heart in the flood
i will leap as i am into the stream
oh that its waters might swallow me and my longing be lost in the flood !
be mine !
lf you have always been be so now !
i will be yours for ever
what you will be be today !
let my arms hold you tight
let our eyes UNknown let us breathe each other 's breath eye to eye mouth to mouth
then you will be to me what in fear you were and will be
then gone would be the doubt whether UNknown is now mine
whether i am now yours ?
divine peace floods my being
purest light blazes in the glow
heaven 's wisdom UNknown from me chased by the joy of love !
whether i am now yours ?
do you not see me ?
as my eyes devour you are you not blinded ?
as my arms UNknown you do you not catch fire ?
as my blood UNknown do you not feel its fire ?
siegfried do you not fear this wild passionate woman ?
as our blood sets us UNknown our eyes scorch one another our arms clasp each other my daring and courage return
and fear that i never learned fear which you taught me
UNknown hero !
laughing i must love you
laughing i will bear my blindness
laughing let us perish
let your fortress fall to dust !
farewell UNknown pomp of the gods !
may your end be UNknown immortal race !
UNknown snap your rope !
hail to the world !
descend dusk of the gods !
she is awake she smiles at me !
your star shines upon me !
mine forever always mine
radiant love !

methinks from such a feast the heir to king attilla 's crowns should not be absent !
methinks the boy has not long to live
we scarcely shall go as guests to any courts of his !
now you nibelungen all of my men will be against you
safe conduct from these halls i demand for me and my following !
here ends the fifth canto
open the gate !
huns avenge your dead !
it is impossible my queen !
avenge your dead huns and the royal child !
hand over the assassin of siegfried and you are free !
the fight is too uneven
the dawn will see no UNknown alive
with UNknown my own child will die !
lord ruediger stay out of it !
blood cries for blood !
call ruediger !
redeem your oath !
not against hagen tronje do you send me queen but against your brothers who defend him with their lives !
ruediger you swore by the sharp edge of your sword !
UNknown is engaged to my only child !
blood cries for blood ruediger !
here ends the sixth canto
he will bring peace !
what are you bringing us father ?
tell them that if they deliver the murderer of my child they may go free !
king attilla you do not know the loyal german soul !
my oath to kriemhild is older than my oath to you !
don 't force me to break my oath !
defend yourself hagen tronje !
o sister what have you wrought !
deliver tronje to me and you are free !
rejoice in your revenge kriemhild !
dead are your young brothers
ruediger is dead
but hagen tronje who slew siegfried still lives !
throw fire into the hall !
o lord fiery arrows are raining on the hall by the queen 's order the palace is burning
lady kriemhild is right more than right !
i myself will stand at her side when the fire will flush out hagen the murderer !
thank you kriemhild !
never king attilla has my heart been as filled with love as it is at this moment
i wish to spare king gunther death in the flames
i shall offer lady kriemhild my head !
speak you nibelungen
loyalty which iron could not break will not melt in fire hagen tronje !
i call it a shame lady kriemhild that you let heroes who could not be beaten in battle perish in fire 's fury !
do you hear ?
do you hear ?
no i died when siegfried died
it is finished !
i cannot go home to my dead siegfried until every wrong has been UNknown
lord hagen here is the sword
where is the treasure ?
i swore not to betray the location of the treasure as long as one of my kings is alive !
now kriemhild nobody knows about the treasure but god and me and god is no more discreet than i !
now earth drink your fill !
take kriemhild home to siegfried her dead husband for she was his and never belonged to another man !
thus ends the tale

but that 's no guarantee they ain 't around
you boys keep your eyes open
at night two men stay awake while one sleeps
they won 't rush two of you
i 'd like to see them try it
just don 't get careless
ben i UNknown l take that deck of cards in your pocket
i ain 't paying you pitch players to sit in the shade all day and claim low
shall i drag her buck ?
drag it luke
i UNknown e seen enough
that UNknown character
well let 's take a look at it
up here 's where we come from
then it UNknown off again to the southeast
down here 's the mexican border
50 miles i figure
so that UNknown character starts playing checkers with us
he figures we UNknown l head this way and right
it 's the first water
so he jumps us and stakes out his deputies
and he UNknown l be there setting waiting
he can keep squatting on his UNknown from now till christmas
cause we ain 't gonna be there
we 'r e doubling back on our tracks to UNknown tanks
but that 's up to the north
we UNknown l get our water
we UNknown l hole up in the UNknown woods until the kid feels better
then while that marshal 's sitting getting UNknown on his rump we UNknown l set out to the east jump the tracks there and be over the border
yes that 's good
it looks like you and me are gonna chew a lot of UNknown cactus if we can find any
kid gets the canteen
i 'm tired of riding
besides it cost me nothing
it come with the horse
wind 's getting hot
let 's make for that draw !
kid are you all right ?
i tied the horses right there to the bushes
but devils must have come in the middle of the night and let them loose
well what are we waiting for ?
UNknown sweet what are you doing here ?
hello miss UNknown
if i 'd seen anything like pants around here they wouldn 't have had to beg for anything
come on curly get that stock off of there will you ?
we ain 't got all day
i 'm doing the best i can marshal !
come on curly move !
hurry it up will you ?
wait a minute !
i 'm not excited
a whole passel of men !
right UNknown UNknown
there ain 't been a soul around here to listen to me
since my old cat got tired and left
i UNknown l bet it was a UNknown
can i drag it now buck ?
i 'm 16 hours and 29 minutes late
drag it luke
drag it jake
they ain 't dry are they ?
worse than that
a man and his woman
they come from new jerusalem
they made the tanks all right but the water was a little low
mr UNknown ain 't got sense enough to dig out the sand sit back and wait for that UNknown hole to fill up
he puts in a stick of dynamite to start the water running
the fool !
only fool 's luck he didn 't blow himself up doing it
i wish he did
he cracked the granite floor of that UNknown hole and busted down her sides
the tanks are dry
they can have UNknown in this country from now till i get religion them tanks will never hold another drop of water
fool UNknown 's dead i guess
but he 's gonna keep right on killing people just the same
men will come here banking on water
five or six years there UNknown l be a dozen skeletons around them busted tanks
but that ain 't biting me half as hard as what he went and done next
he let his stock nose around and lick up that UNknown slop below the tanks
it drove UNknown m plain loco
they took off up the canyon hunting water with him right after them
that 's four days ago
he ain 't back yet
so we don 't need to waste no time UNknown on his case or feeling sorry for him
that wouldn 't have been so bad but he left his woman alone in that wagon
yeah she 's there right now
she had a little water so it wasn 't so bad till yesterday
then it gives out
she 's a nice little woman too
28 or 30 i 'd guess
too blasted good for the cuss she married
but still that ain 't the worst of it
she 's gonna have a baby and she 's gonna have it now
i 'm a tough bird an awful tough old bird but i 'm not going back in there !
pete you gotta go
you ought to know something about these cases
you do don 't you ?
wasn 't you married to a woman down on the r o bravo ?
didn 't she have kids for you ?
tells them what to do with babies how to born them
pete i 'm not passing the buck
i 'm just UNknown for information
i have come to help you
ain 't no use there kid
only water we 'r e gonna get is right over here
but i guess we got plenty of time now
yeah pete ?
give it to him kid
how is she ?
come on let 's get back to squeezing UNknown
she wants to see you all of us together
did she have
you 'r e the one that found me
yes ma 'a m
robert ma 'a m
i 'm proud to make your acquaintance ma 'a m
and you 'r e pete
yes ma 'a m
and i will help
poor little son
and you UNknown l miss me so
nobody to tuck you into bed at night
nobody to teach you your prayers
nobody to kiss the little sore spots when you fall and hurt yourself
nobody to tell your little secrets to
i want you all of you to be my baby 's UNknown
you will be won 't you bob hightower ?
you will bill UNknown ?
yes ma 'a m
like his UNknown you tell him about his mother who so wanted to live for him
lift him up please
it 's getting dark
is that all kid ?
them 's all the words i know bob
hurry up there curly !
we 'r e hurrying buck
i get him behind bars eating some of ma 's cooking
i 'm gonna play him a game of chess
he 'd be right good at it too i UNknown l bet
pay attention here you fellas
come on pay attention
we should have reached there before he did two horses packing three men
and i don 't take him for any UNknown to go rushing three men that 's got winchesters
so i figured that his next move would be to push right on through here to apache wells where we are now
i hate to admit it but he 's UNknown me
they might have give out in that UNknown
not that breed of cat
they could have made for dobie down this way
no that 's too far
so 's dos UNknown down here
they must have gone somewhere buck
yeah and mighty cute too
he 's doubled back on his tracks and holed up right here at UNknown tanks
that 's where we 'r e going
we ain 't gonna waste no time
let 's go collect him
all right buck
remember that reward
gosh buck we want to go with you !
you 'd be a whole lot safer
first thing seems to me we ought to give robert william pedro a bath
a bath ?
i was thinking about feeding him
i 'm for UNknown him all right
of course sooner or later we UNknown e gotta swab him down
but he 's such a little fellow bob
he won 't use much water
he UNknown l fit nice into this UNknown
i was just wishing he could stagger along for a few days without bathing
i don 't know much about infants but little robert boy here looks clean enough for me
didn 't you ask his mother nothing ?
do you think i was gonna drive the lady crazy with a bunch of silly questions ?
in my opinion gentlemen taking a bath is the least of little robert 's troubles
he 's just naturally gotta eat and wear something better than this towel
it UNknown l plumb scratch the hide off of him
when a mother 's gonna have a baby she fixes up things for him
UNknown clothes real nice and UNknown pretty little UNknown and what all
maybe there 's something for our godson in that tail box
she had a heart this mother
how long you gonna be ?
they don 't expect him to walk in them things
and he ain 't gonna wear that
now this is something
she wasn 't figuring to feed him coffee was she ?
this is for UNknown when he fixes himself up
in performing this most important part of the baby 's
there 's a word here i don 't like to say in front of a little baby
toi letty ?
it 's a
i guess robert boy ain 't got no toi letty in his war bag
remember that pete
the first bath should not be administered
until the baby is at least a week old
if i had a sick UNknown i wouldn 't send for that doc UNknown
a week without a bath
that 's all right for a grown boy that ain 't supposed to bathe between water holes or in town on saturday night UNknown his gal
but a baby !
come again kid
should rub the baby 's body with olive oil
or if olive oil is not available
with some clean pure lard or grease
i ain 't convinced nohow
this godson of ours is starting life slippery enough without UNknown him
but you got to follow the book bob
me and you have always been
wouldn 't you like
cut out the UNknown lingo around the kid will you pete ?
first thing you know he UNknown l be talking it
get your finger out !
cut out that mexican
my shoulder kind of UNknown
we UNknown l spare you a couple of UNknown of water in a little bit
you UNknown l feel a lot better
you better see what the doc is dealing next
i got it right here
feeding the baby
is the one which nature has provided
say that again
well that 's out
we got some right here
all right robert william pedro but you 'r e going to get fed
you better get a can of that UNknown milk and some matches
let me hold my godson
just for a little while
thanks bob for taking me along and all
that is pretty what the kid is singing
it 's what the folks back home would call a lullaby
a couple hours and we UNknown l have to set them up again for little robert boy
i 'm for moving on now bob
honest i 'm
that 's the last of the gringo head cactus
she is finished
there ain 't more than three shots apiece in these six cans
that 's 18 shots
that 's right
which doesn 't leave much water for us UNknown
there 's always enough for you kid
here have one on the house
i UNknown e done a heap of ornery things but i ain 't stealing the water that belongs to my godson
too bad the doc didn 't tell us where to get water in the arizona desert
wrong book for that
i can see it all UNknown out where to find our next water where to head
maybe it says we should head back for UNknown and that reception committee
or over to apache wells where old UNknown is sitting
don 't be too sure buck sweet is UNknown his thumbs
i think we ought to get out of here quick now !
60 miles or more with the kid in the shape he 's in ?
and this punk ?
i 'd have UNknown that marshal if they hadn 't saddled this kid on us
why didn 't somebody stop me before i promised that woman ?
i don 't want to grow no long white beard in the yuma penitentiary
may my beard grow clear till it gets down to my UNknown may it get a nest of prison rats before i break my promise to a dying woman !
who said i was breaking my promise ?
why don 't you kill the little fellow ?
feed him to the coyotes !
why you chili UNknown horse thief !
horse thief ?
now you see what you did ?
you make cries the baby !
you UNknown the baby !
don 't blame me !
sure nothing !
you fellas don 't understand
you think this is all just chance ?
just accidental like us coming here this way ?
finding the mother helping her
the infant in the manger
the star so bright last night
i ain 't talking out of no fever sweat bob honest i ain 't
you think we had anything to do with what 's happened ?
no sir we didn 't
no more than you had anything to do with throwing the book so it would open in the place where i UNknown e been reading
where it tells where we 'r e going to next
listen i UNknown l read it
and when the days
according to the law of moses
they lifted up the child and brought him to jerusalem to present him to the lord
it says jerusalem right here in the book
but if i was in a gambling house i would play the kid 's number
you would ?
kid me and pete will spell each other carrying the infant
i 'm toting my godson my share of the way
that 's part of it
that 's in the book too
there was three wise men come from the east wasn 't there ?
three wise men
i 'm betting on you kid
all right pete which way 's jerusalem ?
why that way bob
we got to cross it
don 't be a fool kid
that 's all right
once we 'r e across the flats we 'r e through the worst of it
it will be easier crossing the sand
there 's plenty of rough country over there kid
i ain 't figuring on going that far
take your horses down to the tanks boys
fill up your kegs first
sure need it marshal
curly take a look in that wagon
gosh buck there 's been a woman here
left her dresses all this and that way
what are they like ?
one 's real nice sort of faded but soft like silk
is it red ?
has the top got all little white ribbons all around the rim ?
it sure has buck
fourth of july
come on curly
lot of boys stick up UNknown and banks and one thing or another
but a man that would dynamite a water hole in this kind of country is downright criminal
how about giving the stock
i UNknown l add 50 to it
i 'd like UNknown m dead
it 's time
there we sat down
if i forget thee o jerusalem
let my right hand forget her cunning
how shall we sing the lord 's song
in a strange land ?
our father who art in heaven
i pray the lord my soul to keep
if i should die before i wake pray the lord
my soul to take
make me a good boy
i think about 50 minutes
they 'r e slipping it easy to the kid up there
it 's broke
and drag you
you will make it
not for more than two hours
maybe you better leave me your pistol
the coyotes you know ?
yeah sure pete
it 's all right
loose them and bring them unto me
a donkey and his colt
you just try stealing a man 's burro in this country !
they 'd string you
this is the end of the trail little robert
i 'm going
you quit it you hear ?
milk for the infant and a cool cool beer for me
a baby !
you got me
texas you 'r e about half smart
jury still out curly ?
yep still out
i UNknown l thank you to remember there 's only one boss around here
yes sir and she says chow 's down
morning carrie lou
thanks carrie lou
yeah they 'r e real comfortable
hope the batter on this chicken is to your liking
corn oysters ?
i only had but two ears of sweet corn
all right seeing what he did for little buck
his name is robert william pedro hightower
yes of course it is until the court changes it
you ain 't eaten much lately
you off your feed or something ?
i 'm worrying
maybe the judge won 't give you the full 20 years
it ain 't that
i 'm worrying since i UNknown little robert this morning
he 's losing weight
he didn 't lose any when i was nursing him
if he were our very own we couldn 't love him more
ma don 't carry on now
one thing you can count on bob hightower you couldn 't find better hands to leave the little mite in than UNknown 's and mine
that 's right bob
see ma i knew he would
i knew i had you pegged right
look you just sign this paper right there on the x see ?
wait up now
the adoption papers of course
i ain 't anxious to turn my godson to pasture
you just said right there that we were distant relations
how they look ?
your honor we find the prisoner guilty according to law but under UNknown circumstances
before passing sentence upon you robert UNknown hightower
now have you anything you wish to say ?
you ain 't ?
he is my godson
who gets him etc
yes i know
prisoner have you any objection to the marshal and mrs sweet taking this here child ?
if you mean permanent i got plenty of objections but if it 's temporary that 's different providing of course they guarantee to give him a good education and such
and just what specific do you mean as and such etc ?
teach him good horse sense respect say yes sir when he 's spoke to and
that seems reasonable
sure you would but you ain 't going to get

robert william pedro
goodbye and good luck boy
a year in jail will do you real good
thank you ma 'a m
see he gets started home from yuma all right
you know he 's never been away from welcome before
sure i UNknown l take care of him
put him on the train myself
i 'm mighty glad you liked it
it would have been a lot lighter without that UNknown you baked in it
proud to haul you son
can i write to you mr hightower ?
can i call you bob ?
i 'd be proud for you to take your pen in hand miss latham
what do you mean ?
i 'm your brother
it 's all right
i would ask that you consider postponing the signing of the treaty
he said that it concerned national security and that it involved you
is she all right ?
no she 's not all right
she 's having another one of her delusions
what is this ?
no one 's lying to you derek
i 'm not hungry
if you had wanted to tell me about your past you would have
please don 't hang up on me
i need your help
she 's dead
what are you doing here ?
i 'm sorry i followed you
i 'm just worried about my mother
you 'r e going with me
hold your fire chloe
to set you up
you 'r e the one that killed palmer
you need to post two more people here at delta
it 's a likely point of UNknown
i UNknown l pull assets from somewhere else
we have a visual on the suspect
he may be the palmer shooter
were you able to make an id ?
i think you should see for yourself
about an hour before president palmer was shot someone broke into the building the sniper used
we have a frame grab from a security video
i ran it through a high UNknown filter so it may take a few seconds to render
they 'r e setting me up for palmer 's assassination
palmer 's not even president
why kill him ?
no i need to find out who really killed president palmer
how are you gonna do that ?
start at the beginning investigate the original crime scene
david palmer was visiting his brother
maybe he left something there that can help me
palmer was killed an hour ago
the place will be crawling with secret service fbl police
i need UNknown and an UNknown UNknown grid
can you get that for me or not ?
i 'm sorry you had to see that derek
get in the van
you 'r e gonna do exactly what i tell you
let go of me
the only reason you 'r e still conscious is because i don 't wanna carry you
jack was in the building the sniper fired from at the time palmer was assassinated
that 's impossible
bill you were there when jack was shot
he had no pulse no UNknown
and i have no idea how jack staged his own death
but i understand his reasons
he was to be handed to the chinese to spend his life in prison
yeah but none of that explains why jack would want to kill david palmer
i had curtis pull the phone logs
palmer tony and michelle were all talking to jack right before he was supposedly killed
our working theory is that they conspired to help jack fake his own death
now you 'r e saying that jack was behind the attack on tony and michelle too ?
why would jack want to kill the people who helped him ?
he may have stopped trusting them to keep his secret
jack would never murder his friends
but right now it 's the best explanation for the evidence we have
i 'm sorry
i UNknown l call the president
i had UNknown run data recovery on tony 's phone records
chloe was on those calls with president palmer and tony
chloe knew jack was alive ?
she should be here
i wanted to run a locate but UNknown talked me out of it
if anything happens to her it 's your fault
we need to get to her before jack does
put out an UNknown alert
bauer 's now the prime suspect in palmer 's assassination
UNknown that he 's a former agent and should be considered extremely dangerous
excuse me sir
mrs logan called again
why would he call my wife about a national security threat ?
that 's what she says he wanted to talk to her about a matter of national security
maybe if i investigated the phone call
stay focused on the summit
i am sir
showing her the truth might help her get on with her responsibilities
so what are you suggesting ?
if palmer called her yesterday our office will have a recording of their conversation
get that for me
mr president audrey raines is holding on line three
ms raines president logan
sir ctu has a suspect in the assassination of president palmer
bauer is dead
i don 't understand
ctu has verified surveillance video placing jack bauer at the same time in the same building as the sniper who killed president palmer
audrey this is walt cummings
let me get clear on this
are you saying that bauer shot david palmer ?
we 'r e proceeding under that assumption
david palmer might have known bauer was alive knowledge he shared with three ctu agents all of whom were UNknown in the last hour
he does have a history of insubordination irrational behaviour UNknown
jack bauer has a history of great service to this country
how does this affect the summit ?
we 'r e recommending that you delay or UNknown until jack is apprehended
ms raines you have a suspect
should we inform his security chief that he 's a potential target ?
how did this happen ?
i 'm not sure
any sign of bauer now ?
we UNknown l have him in 24 hours
bauer won 't UNknown the operation ?
he won 't have a chance
we launch in less than an hour
their hardware 's military UNknown
UNknown grenades UNknown grenades
who are these people ?
diane i know it 's hard but please try not to worry
derek is fine
i 'm about a half hour outside of la
just tell me where to meet you
i don 't know yet
head towards the city
can i talk to him ?
who was that ?
i have to hang up now mom
don 't worry
we 'r e told that that speculation will not be addressed because the government says security is of utmost importance
behind me is the los angeles apartment building where president palmer was assassinated a little more than an hour ago
you can also see americans of all ages
pull up please
can you get a wireless access point ?
i 'm reading the agents UNknown
i can track their locations to within three feet
jack there are 167 agents in and around the location 25 of them in wayne palmer 's apartment alone
testing one two
just put it in your ear and we 'r e set to go
derek put out the light
can you help with that ?
all right let me check
are you sure he 's ok ?
i 'm going up now
there are four agents waiting at the lobby
hold off on going up if you can
i 'm entering the apartment
most of the agents are in the living room
that must be where palmer was shot
there are two rooms to the north 15 feet probably bedrooms
they 'r e clear
let me know if anyone comes this way
will do jack
he told my mother and i his name 's frank
who is he really ?
is that why we 'r e where the president was killed ?
please don 't ask me any more questions
can 't you at least tell me why he had to pretend he was someone else ?
certain people thought the best way to cover up their mistakes was to get rid of jack
you mean kill him ?
he has a daughter ?
i UNknown e already told you more than i should UNknown e
i have a computer in the study UNknown up
president palmer had a UNknown account
is it password secured ?
that 's where we UNknown l look
give me the computer 's ip address
i UNknown l UNknown a UNknown program to it
not according to the UNknown grid
do not raise your voice
you son of a bitch
you killed my brother
any evidence they showed you against me has been UNknown
i served your brother for years
i would have gladly given my life for his
he was my friend
i was hoping to find clues on that computer
why don 't you ask secret service to help ?
i 'm being set up
whoever 's behind this has planted evidence making me the shooter
it 's useless to try to convince the authorities
and you think you UNknown l convince me ?
if i killed your brother why didn 't i kill you when you walked through the door ?
think about this wayne
take the gun
take the gun
david palmer was elected president with a 60 UNknown
here you are mrs logan
david and i first got to know each other when he was elected to congress
he and charles never saw eye to eye politically
david never let that get in the way of our friendship
that picture 's from his UNknown
at the ball i was one of the first people david asked to dance
we need a few more minutes with your hair
i 'm just trying to help
i 'm sorry evelyn
i was beginning to think you were ignoring me
so when did this call take place ?
i UNknown l have someone pull up the call from the audio archives
i wouldn 't say that mrs logan
well of course you wouldn 't say it
did your brother say or do anything out of the ordinary before he was shot ?
he 'd been distracted ever since he came to los angeles
i finally called him on it this morning
what 'd he say ?
he never had the chance to say anything jack
the UNknown 's done
ok i 'm going into it now
that 's the first chapter of his UNknown
it makes no sense
there are print outs of it all over the place
maybe he hid some information in it
we UNknown l compare this to the print out see if he added or changed anything
i UNknown e got one right here
if you 'r e upset about me and chloe
i don 't care
don 't you think i know that ?
look you 'r e just making it harder for me to do my job
use chloe 's access code
the system says i 'm already signed in
let me see
are you sure it 's her ?
even i don 't know how to do that
then she 's alive
i 'm running a locate now
what 's she using the system to do ?
all i can see from here is she 's tracking secret service and fbi UNknown
the locate came back
signal 's faint
let me know if she changes location
why would chloe be at the scene of palmer 's murder tracking agents ?
she wouldn 't be
what do you mean ?
maybe jack left evidence he needs to erase
surrounded by all those agents ?
jack can explain when we apprehend him
bill buchanan at ctu
we were delayed
you should be on your way
we UNknown l be there in 20 minutes as planned
call me when you 'r e approaching
a name and an address
it looks like an address
check all flights into UNknown
look for a passenger UNknown
try and make the connection
jack secret service is changing its UNknown
i 'm on my way down
they know that i 'm here
let me help you get out of here jack
and until we know who to trust you can 't tell anybody what we found
do you understand ?
i UNknown l be in touch
chloe i need another way out of here
one agent at the door
where are they concentrating their agents ?
they cut off access to my grid
i don 't know where the agents are
they were in the lobby
i 'm getting out on the second floor
come on jack
he 's a baggage supervisor at the airport
step into view with your hands in the air
we know you 'r e down here
step into view with your hands in the air
we got a visual
step out of the vehicle
check the back
i just need to know where you are
i 'm on the 210 at the 10
ok i want you to take the 10 east to the UNknown airport
go to the parking lot in front of the terminal
i UNknown l meet you on the west side of it
but it 's gonna be all right
i UNknown l be there in a few minutes
she tried to escape our agents and leave the building
you 'r e telling me she wasn 't under UNknown ?
not as far as i can tell
put her on the phone
jack 's being framed to cover up the real reason palmer was assassinated
says jack ?
i heard his dying confession
you UNknown l find his body at the UNknown at UNknown and UNknown
do you have evidence that palmer 's death is to do with the summit ?
why not ?
you 'r e trying to arrest him
chloe i 'm not gonna ask you again
i 'm ordering you to tell me where jack is
i 'm sorry
curtis take a team to the UNknown
edgar make sure chloe goes into a holding cell when she gets back
that woman chloe she told me some stuff about what you used to do
yeah well she shouldn 't have
why did you have to lie ?
couldn 't you have just told us the truth ?
first of all you have to understand i never thought anything like this could ever happen
after your mother rented me that room
i started to remember what it was like to have a family
how nice it was
i know you don 't believe this now but i really do care about you
and i care about your mother
i hope one day you can understand that
i told him approximately when it took place
why don 't we sit down ?
i don 't want to sit down
he said it was a matter of national security
those were his exact words
there 's got to be a connection of course
there isn 't
this was not a conspiracy this was one man acting out some kind of grudge
did you hear the call ?
can we just drop this ?
did you or didn 't you hear it ?
did i wake you ?
no no david
i need to talk to you
it 's hardly a matter of national security but i 'm UNknown a charity dinner next month for the art in action programme
no that 's not it
i would like you to be there
no that is not it
that is not it
yes it is
i am not crazy
he said if you are not consistent with your medication you can become UNknown
your memory can be affected
he said that ?
i know you don 't like how these pills make you feel but you need to take them
if jack was responsible for palmer 's death why would chloe cover him ?
it doesn 't make sense
there 's something else going on here and we 'r e missing it
nsa intercepted some chatter identifying the summit as a target
we 'r e UNknown it now but the UNknown 's approaching 95
time frame ?
that 's when UNknown 's scheduled to land
logan said he won 't postpone this summit
in light of this he may not have a choice
UNknown 's helicopter is leaving the air base
his arrival at the retreat is on schedule
as are we
no communication until after your strike
i will monitor your progress from here
ctu has confirmed intelligence suggesting president UNknown 's helicopter will be UNknown
how good is this intelligence ?
i will not postpone this summit
then at least have UNknown alter his arrival plan
his chopper can land at a different site
he can come by UNknown
the risk would be reduced
and the impact of his arrival would also be reduced
the media is waiting for a landing in five minutes
it 's up to secret service and the air force to protect our UNknown
make sure they do it
there 's your mom
you 'r e a good kid
go get your mom
my name 's not frank
it 's jack bauer
and i UNknown l explain as soon as i can but right now you and derek need to go to this address
you need to ask for a man named bill buchanan
tell him i sent you
i 'm sorry
tell him the truth
down that hall to the left
UNknown is giving us the all clear on the UNknown on the retreat unprecedented levels of security
the president admits UNknown was given an air escort of f 16 fighter jets
any word from our agents on the ground ?
if they 'r e going to attack the helicopter it 's going to be now
the helicopter touching down now
it will be only moments before presidents logan and UNknown will meet face to face for the first time
president logan smiling UNknown UNknown a greeting to his russian UNknown
our intel must UNknown e been wrong relief that UNknown arrived without incident
the ceremony will be carried live throughout the world
mom do you see those men ?
something 's wrong
derek where are you going ?
come back here
get back in
i don 't know what you 'r e talking about
you will tell me
i have dealt with the martha logan situation
she 's not going to be a problem ?
there 's no evidence on my end that palmer was trying to warn her about the attack
it UNknown l only be a matter of time till the president is notified of the demands
7 00 02 10 380 00 02 15 145 his gloomy air betrayed his ambitious projects
11 00 03 18 263 00 03 22 126 merchants dancers 12 00 03 22 161 00 03 28 534 UNknown officials and many more waited to see the prince

listen i must get to UNknown !
perhaps captain UNknown
i must get to UNknown !
yes this is the grand duke nicolai 's car 200 UNknown !
i UNknown e been told at the port 's office captain that he 's a man who doesn 't fear a single thing
my stork has just been chartered for another trip to UNknown
by professor UNknown
i appeal to your sense of justice madam !
it would be far worse than mere UNknown to leave for UNknown without me
professor see us as two simple travellers who must go to UNknown UNknown
if you want to get to UNknown you don 't need my consent but my wife 's !
i believe he 's well tamed !
two gentlemen from UNknown
are you out of your mind getting down with no disguise ?
don 't you remember you 'r e being chased ?
i hope you want to go to UNknown to help the grand duke
i must go to UNknown at once !
didn 't i tell you UNknown is in a hurry ?
UNknown UNknown has had a new moment of inspiration and decides to address all his travel companions as highness from then on
what ship is this ?
it 's a single engine to the service of his imperial highness the grand duke nicolai of russia
i UNknown l go to UNknown on that ship !
end of chapter 4
i must get aboard admiral !
no way !
UNknown UNknown who can show recommendation from
her imperial highness the grand duchess olga
destination UNknown !
i 'm a journalist !
i have to be where things are happening !
and your wife ?
you wouldn 't be asking that if you knew my wife !
for god 's sake !
what an extraordinary effect a little sea breeze has had !
i can 't wait to get to UNknown !
what newspaper does your husband write for ?
ah you 'r e on your honeymoon ?
good afternoon mr president !
what have you done to UNknown and UNknown you rascals ?
at the white pavilion !
it 's too much for your nerves your highness
get some rest
end of chapter 5
nice gallows your highness !
wouldn 't you say so ?
revenge is sweet my son !
let 's hang the grand duke of UNknown !
how much is it worth for you honey ?
a million francs each will it do ?
don 't let her fool you !
if she has that much money let 's take it from her !
don 't touch him !
as true as i am the grand duchess olga
i tell you i UNknown l take your lives if you take his !
well you UNknown l see him hung !
my brother !
get the gallows ready now !
will you tell me why ?
a man who uses the letters of the woman who loves him as an exchange item deserves hanging
you UNknown l have to prove it first !
will you be deceived by this ridiculous forgery of my handwriting ?
if this letter is false where is the real one ?
get him to arrange a wedding !
a punishment must take place !
i must have something i always pass out when someone gets married
a toast for your marriage to be as happy an operation as mine with UNknown 's public debt has been !
i UNknown l register it later
1 25 plus 3 75
not enough change
what an idiot !
i took it all from him
10 20 30 40 50
i 'm sure you need the change
if you have a 100 bill i UNknown l give you 50 and 50 100 in change
he did that to me
what the fuck is going on ?
what did you take from her ?
he pulled a trick on me !
he took money from me !
son of a bitch !

who the fuck do you think you are talking to ?
i 'm sorry
is this it ?
to file your report and to return this to you
don 't move from here
do you smoke ?
do you want ?
what an asshole !
i should know when someone 's pulling a trick on me
depends on who 's doing it
it was the gun that convinced me
the gun ?
he pulled a trick on me !
why did you help me out ?
it was a pity that you 'd get canned for 45 lousy bucks
how do you know it 's 45 bucks ?
i did that trick a million times
and i know you can 't do it twice at the same store
you get in you do it and you get out that 's it
unless you want to get beaten and canned not necessarily in that order
you are swindler
that 's a strange way of saying thanks
i said thanks
not me what do you want ?
what do i want ?
survive i guess
thanks a lot but i 'm doing fine
yeah i can see that
i 'm not the UNknown nor the fastest but i know the UNknown

if you want to keep on playing in the UNknown
i 'm sorry
it 's for me
a bit larger than this one

when there was a game on tv it was one of the few days dad stayed at home
i would set my wooden racetrack and play with the car mum would listen to her favorite record by rita UNknown
rita UNknown ?
when we were together at home we listened to rita UNknown
ii UNknown dei UNknown know the song ?
who is it ?
it went para pa pa pa para

UNknown n how could you ?
you have to check before going out

but you could have a coffee with your aunt
i promise auntie

don 't worry i 'm coming down
your friend can be trusted ?
she gave me 100
and she gave me this to return to her
why didn 't you keep it ?
i 'm not a crook
what is it ?
no it 's not that
what is it ?
gas station clerks it 's ok trusting old ladies never
it 's not that she told me i looked like her grandson
how can you work the streets with such a conscience ?
that 's my problem
go in order a coffee
pay with this and get out
you don 't know me
i need money
lot 's of it
what is it you woke up feeling ambitious ?
no it 's my father
i 'm gathering money for him

he is in trouble
yes we get along fine
he taught me the tricks for working
when i was a kid as a game
UNknown UNknown UNknown
he regretted having taught me
he said it was wrong
he told me not to screw my life like he had screwed his
he told me to do anything else
i did anything
everything i did was a failure
what did you answer when asked what did you want to be ?
i heard it a lot at home and what can you do for a living with such a vocation ? minister ?
now that my dad needs the money the only way i have to get it is to use the tricks he taught me
i try hard to remember each phrase and each flick of the hands
i sell my apartment to start an import business that didn 't even get of the ground
well the 70 grand are still there like the carrot
you were saying ?
what change sir ?
no you gave me nothing
come on i 'm in a hurry
sir you didn 't pay me
what is it you are serving too many tables ?
shall i help you ? manager !
you didn 't pay 100 or anything else
don 't shout
what is it ?
are you calling me a liar ?
what confusion ?
i don 't have that many to get confused
i had two and now i have one
there 's no confusion
look that 's it
the bill with which i paid is missing the tip
check in your register box if you have a bill with a missing tip
let 's cut it out i 'm in a hurry
come with me
go and get me my change
i 'm not going anywhere
are you crazy ?
it 's not my style
but that 's the point pal
they are not prepared to get into a scandal
what is the key ?
if the going gets tough you accuse the rest of them
but it 's not the same
what part ?
the risk of something going wrong
if the going gets rough i can 't do it
you chose the wrong job
i didn 't chose
i have to make a call
it 's private you know
arrange it bye
with my lawyer
i still have some outstanding business
who was it ?
i don 't know
i don 't know if its worth it
all this perhaps it 's best that you go on with your stuff
UNknown must be coming back soon and if he finds out i replaced him he UNknown l get mad
UNknown is a bit jealous
no wait what is it ?
nothing this is not for you
you are not into it
you could fuck up and if that happens
wait what could i fuck up ?
what kind of an asshole do you think i am ?
the kind who thinks too much
is that a liability ?
it 's a liability
look i need the money
this is not about learning a couple of tricks
any asshole knows this
talent and you UNknown e got it
otherwise i wouldn 't be alive
that she voluntarily hand me her purse ?
in two minutes
please don 't say that
it happens all the time
holy shit !
no we UNknown l do something else
we 'r e going out and we UNknown l use the stairs
let me help you
shall i hold it for you ?
i didn 't know that one
neither did i
something money can 't buy

i 'm sick and tired of coming myself to get it
what 's your address ?

10 20 ?
who is this ?
what do you want ?

i hope not literally
the house doctor has already seen him and they UNknown l call an ambulance shortly

that 's why they must be sold today
he UNknown l go for it
he must believe it 's now or never
please take me to the toilet

let me get this straight
you came to the hotei asking for the UNknown
when you couldn 't get through you got nervous because you thought you 'd blown it
is that so ?
so you need someone to sell the goods for you today
why me of all people ?
when i fell ill i saw your sister and i thought
why not ?
you didn 't expect this did you ?
here i am again trusting you
you are desperate
you don 't set the UNknown i do
because if i leave now all you UNknown l get will be an UNknown at a public hospital

don 't fuck with me UNknown
i can call someone else
no if you could call someone else you would have already done so
how much do you want ?
you are crazy
i am not negotiating
or nothing UNknown
it was the other way round
i never learn
you are fucked up
if i tell her the old man sends me she UNknown l give them to me

which part ?
kid i UNknown e sold barbed wire seeds and got thanked for it
do you think i can get scared with some stamps ?

what was the name of the guy ?
none of your business
it 's nothing
i UNknown l be back

that 's it let 's go
we won 't bother you again

we 'd love to but we can 't
he 's not in ! my husband is not in !

nothing it 's just
but i will not allow this i won 't let you
that 's why i don 't open my door to anyone
let 's go the lady is right

if we ever visit her again we UNknown l take her the photos otherwise not
and she was looking forward to see these photos but never mind
we UNknown l fix it somehow
yes some old photos of my uncle UNknown and his family in poland
you husband promised to make us some copies of the UNknown and we wanted to give them to my mum now that we are traveling to visit

i don 't know
how are you dear UNknown ?
i 'm sorry washington
you are right
whatever you want
third parties ?
what i want is for you to leave
don 't you want to make a gift ?
you could impress your loved ones
nothing better than a UNknown UNknown to impress your loved ones
and you young man ?
anything else ?
computer UNknown paintings electronic goods ?
i have an excellent japanese motorbike with minor damages
what damages ?
a UNknown ?
do you have a 357 ? UNknown
i 'm not a crook
have a nice day
any make in particular ?
an idea ?
what 's up ?
i 'm about to take a leak
at the hotel
i UNknown l try to sell them there
are you crazy ?
no not even close
i 'm talking on the phone
don 't fuck around with me !
this is the second time today i see you around
you and that other prick
what do you want ?
i do the asking you just answer
what are you doing here ?
what is the trick this time ?
this is no trick
it 's legal no strings attached
in the hotei UNknown ?
don 't fuck with me !
do you want me to get reai mad ?
we are all here now
look at the face of this guy
where did you find him ?
the people at the hotei are worried
come and explain everything to me
that won 't be necessary
i 'm sure you won 't mind showing me your id
put the gun down
a guest at the hotel and these gentlemen are here because i summoned them
you summoned them ?
you might be a guest here the king of spain but i don 't
you come with me
you bastard !
i should go to hollywood
he bought it !
we must go back
no you have to give me your part
you owe me 200
follow me my partners are waiting for me
are you ok ?
he gets it at his job together with the gun
let 's not waste any time
you told the cop you have something to sell
a UNknown deal as you said
and for what i heard of your phone conversation
i might be interested
i have nothing to sell nor did i ask any favor
we are here to be polite
you helped us out in the UNknown a misunderstanding
but the truth is i don 't know who you are
what do you say ? my partner speaks for me too
if you had something to sell to me you 'd knock on my door just like a book peddler
but if you were a smart UNknown you 'd try to interest me
you 'd find a way to have me look for you and not the other way round
you could for example have a telephone conversation with an alleged buyer and make sure i 'd listen to it
but you have to be subtle
you shouldn 't say anything like
you are crazy !
i have something to sell
but it 's legal i promise
do you understand ?
i don 't know what you are talking about
besides it is true that if you had approached me directly perhaps i would have never talked with you
i don 't care you did it this way really
as long as what you have is good and interests me
i really don 't know what you are talking about man cut it out
the show is over
if you have something to offer me do it or fuck off
i have little time left and much to do
do you have this ?
and where did you get it ? my grandfather gave them to me shortly before he died a few months ago
he got them from a german guy he met on a ship
he paid seven pesos for them
are you interested ?
i might want to buy them
that would be good for all of us
come back in an hour
i want to see the stamps and then we UNknown l talk about money
today today yes
unfortunately i have to leave your city tomorrow morning
you didn 't know that ?
i didn 't know
and believe me i UNknown l miss this country
i UNknown e never seen such good will for doing business
in my room at four o clock
let go that phone UNknown !
i told you not to fuck around in the hotel
don 't worry we
what is it with you asshole ?
don 't you know how my brother 's partners end up ?
or do you really believe you UNknown l get any money out of UNknown ?
don 't come back
i UNknown l call the police
excuse me by any chance do you remember a song by rita UNknown
ii UNknown dei UNknown ?
come on let 's go
what did your sister mean with what she said ?
about what ?
how could i know ?
why did you stop working with UNknown ?
none of your business
technically we could say i UNknown UNknown the dividends
you fucked him
besides it couldn 't have been that bad if he called me again
don 't worry
why not ?
i 'm not convinced
how much ?
yes we 'd only be losing let me see
two and a half three million
i UNknown l call you later
we should run lab tests on the ink
and a UNknown
you are supposed to be the best at least i 'm paying you as if you were
so cut it out and tell me if they are good or not
should i pay for them or somebody with lots of guts is trying to screw me ?
go ahead do whatever is necessary
the stamps are good
how 's the game going ?
a sheet of stamps of the UNknown republic with a rare distribution of the edges
you are right mr
these are the UNknown UNknown
you pay him
what i had thought
one thing is for sure
you don 't sell stamps for a living
these stamps were dropped on your lap and whatever you get for them is like a gift from heaven
am i wrong ?
nevertheless we 'd rather sell them here now without any further delays
but i could also get financing or go to the states
i can auction them
if we check the UNknown
fuck the UNknown !
it 's me who is going to buy those stamps
the rest is bullshit
i won 't give you a cent more than
i will not be robbed my grandfather kept these stamps all his life and i will not give them away to the first one who comes along
i don 't care how millionaire he is
i won 't blow them and that 's final
well well well
we deliver them at 10 and he UNknown l pay us 450 000 dollars
of the balance is mine minus expenses
where is the trick ?
you think i 'm screwing you ?
this is not real
give me that
it 's 450 grand
what is it kid ?
something keeps you from enjoying life ?
do you need UNknown ?
look you can be sure i UNknown l kill you if i lose this deai because of you
does it look suspect ?
i should get rid of you right now
perhaps you are starting to love me
what do you want ?
how did it go ?
how did what go ?
what do you want ?
did he buy them ?
what is he talking about ?
i don 't know
what 's due to me
what are you talking about ?
what the fuck are you talking about ?
look you know very well those stamps are worth nothing
i mean the UNknown yes but what you are trying to sell to UNknown
they are not bad
i didn 't ask
if you tell him
who the fuck do you think you are talking to ?
i UNknown l get in touch with you
how do i know you UNknown l call ?
do you want me to sign an iou ?
among thieves this is the way it 's done
it 's based on trust
i 'm not a thief
at what time ?
we are fucked
it wasn 't a dream
it is now
no but there 's nothing to be done it 's over
these stamps are fucked up the others
what is it ?
yes but UNknown said that
UNknown is an asshole
we tell them they are already sold and that we only need to deliver them and collect
and if she doesn 't want to ?
she UNknown l want
if not you can do your UNknown UNknown part
he suggested that perhaps you were very attached to the collection and that it would mean a memory for you
of my husband of course
it 's true the stamps remind me of my husband
what an asshole !
but that doesn 't mean i wouldn 't sell them if i need the money
for some time now i UNknown e been thinking in turning them into something useful
i 'm running expenses
fifty thousand cash
excuse me i honestly don 't
cut the acting with me
you thing i don 't know those stamps are valuable ?
what 's your line of work UNknown old ladies ?
i don 't know the exact value and i don 't care
let me explain dear
whoever wants the stamps puts that amount on my table and he can take them
that 's all
whoever wants them pays for them and takes them
and what is the happy figure ?
the stamps are not worth that
that 's none of your business
if you pay today you have them today
what is it ?
this is it
we must go on
buying the stamps from the old bitch
are you crazy ?
one day of work 200 grand profit
where are you going to get 250 grand ?
i have some money
i saw an opportunity and grabbed it
i was UNknown than she that 's all
if not she would have done it to you
without any doubt
then we are saved
but i don 't have all the money
i have the inheritance plus something i can get from the lawyer plus my money UNknown 200 grand
and where are we going to get the rest ?
well you have 50 grand for your old man
untii you said it
stop it !
fuck off !
would i show you the way i do things the way i am how i work ?
what sort of a dumb fuck would that make me ?
a very intelligent one
you arranged it with the old girl ?
how much does UNknown get less ?
you are an idiot
you have 200 grand UNknown
i have 50
juan these things happen mate
it 's a one in a million chance
once in a lifetime
one in a million
fucking hell !
how are you ?
this is full of crooks
and what about the money ?
what happened ?
the case will be drawn again and anyone could be the judge and anyone won 't fix it
so if i don 't get the money in 10 days
i lose the train
where am i going to get 70 000 ?
you can 't stay here dad
am i losing it ?
not in the way you are thinking
i have already made those mistakes
don 't you do it again
do you think it 's a game ?
do you think the guys who do this are easy ?
i got fucked a thousand times and you haven 't seen see what i saw
i mean it don 't be dumb
don 't do anything that could land you here
you wouldn 't survive
if you give me a hard time it UNknown l take me longer to finish my business
that 's it
i don 't know what i UNknown l say but you won 't stay in my hotel
your hotel ?
you UNknown l call the police ?
wasn 't it enough busting my balls all my life occupying mum 's place as soon as she died and now you want to fuck me with this ?
listen well i 'm only going to say it once
i am not fucking around in your hotel my hard luck is that the guy is staying here
that 's all
you don 't kill people
you don 't know me
what are you doing ?
ah friends !
you had already met ?
we UNknown e know each other for a long time
the lady is my sister
i 'm going to make you rich
him i 'm sure not me
the best would be for us to go to my room and finish our business
you ok ?
no he didn 't hurt me
i 'm ok
man it 's only one night
and now i can
then the deai is cancelled

dr UNknown gave you different ones
the hands of the executed murderer UNknown

the murderer UNknown before his judges
UNknown denied the act but the fingerprints which were found gave the real evidence
the dagger which was stuck into the heart of the old racketeer bore the same x mark on the handle
also the dagger bore UNknown 's unmistakable fingerprints
the evidence was so clear that he received the death penalty
i feel it also go out the arms spread until then in the soul cold terrible grim
twisted twisted hands !

UNknown 's handwriting !
UNknown has been dead for years but his hands still live

i will go to the state prosecutor and tell him who your father 's murderer is
who is the murderer ?
and who has those fingers now you paul UNknown !
the letter which passed through all the servants in the house was written by the hand of UNknown and this hand is now your hand !
the dagger with which the murder was done is UNknown 's dagger with the x
your maid will swear that she saw you with it in your hand
perhaps you did not do the murder but you cannot deny
what is happening to me ?

i have the feeling that these hands are drawing me to crime
i must bring him the money
you will tell the state prosecutor everything
who will believe me ?
they will believe you as i believe you
i go in a free man
wait perhaps and we will have news for the evening paper

someone well known to us mr UNknown at last
assistant to professor UNknown
i am also a blackmailer

i don 't have those hands
haven 't you considered that the murderer has UNknown 's hands
i don 't have those hands
i can tell you who has those hands
mr UNknown i arrest you !
mr UNknown is not guilty UNknown is the murderer
keep silent !
UNknown was UNknown 's friend
he secretly made UNknown of UNknown 's fingerprints
and then he had rubber gloves made with UNknown 's fingerprints
and so he killed the elder UNknown
and so he killed the old racketeer and then made it look as if UNknown had done it
UNknown is not guilty of the death
if UNknown was not guilty then my hands are pure
i 'm going to slip this ring on the one i love
jung suh !
a friendship ring
let 's just have one each
or she UNknown l take it out on me later
look at the time
i can understand how jung suh feels
i wish she 'd find someone soon
she 's the older sister
it would be nice if she got married first
han UNknown su
i don 't think jung suh is over him yet
five years isn 't a short time
i think we UNknown e been neglecting her
mom stop that
you 'r e only concerned about him ?
i 'm jealous
you 'r e concerned about me ?
thank you for today
hang jung suh !
why are you so late ?
i told you i had an appointment
that 's right you did
by the way these gloves are really warm
it feels like holding your hand
i 'm done with my girlfriend for the day
i can see my friend now right ?
i 'm going home
i 'm really drunk
don 't do this
let me sing it for you
i 'm going
we 'r e friends
we 'r e friends
have a good one
it hurts too much
to the degree that it hurts you can be good friends
you were good friends as children
too much has changed now
it seems to me your love for each other hasn 't changed
so what has changed ?
find out where han UNknown su is
i UNknown l take these now
long time no see
how 's your schedule ?
are you threatening me ?
i really don 't know what your motive is for doing this
don 't you want the best for jung suh ?
by exposing that you 'r e yuri 's brother and that yuri caused jung suh 's accident
do you think it UNknown l work out between jung suh and song ju ?
by doing so you UNknown l probably ruin yuri but jung suh will be ruined as well
who knows what happened in the five years you and jung suh lived together ?
nothing happened between us
marriage is no game
yuri 's brother as a favor to you
but you 'r e wrong
she can 't say it
she knows that the moment she reveals it it 's the end for her too
it doesn 't matter what you say
i 'm going to reveal everything
there 's still some time before the wedding
if you want to give jung suh a chance you can 't do this
am i wrong ?
if you want to come by come anytime
it doesn 't matter to me
so what matters is who i tell first
what happened to that thing i asked you about ?
i don 't need anything else !
i want han UNknown su 's painting !
han UNknown su you 'r e quite talented
was it you guys who turned me in ?
we UNknown e been on the alert since you were taken in
let 's end this quickly
paint a few more
the situation doesn 't look good
so what should we do ?
you 'r e not leaving here until you produce a decent painting so it 's up to you !
hurry up and paint man !
brother it 's the police !
let 's get out of here !
please see to it that he 's taken care of
the president is waiting
whether it 's me or han UNknown su
would you stand on one foot when you 'r e thinking of me ?
then i UNknown l know right away
like this ?
i couldn 't think of you even if i wanted to
it 'd be too much work
don 't think about me anymore
i won 't ask you to think about me anymore so forget about me
i thought i could do everything for you
you came back at last but there 's nothing i can do for you
han jung suh
our friendship will continue forever
i know this cabin in the mountains
it 's quiet there so it 'd be great for UNknown
that 's okay
i UNknown l send a car to the house in the morning
what 's this ?
you call me here to tell me this ?
i 'm not sure if i 'm doing the right thing
as far as what ?
i get the feeling if you go you might not come back
when will she be returning ?
when it 's time i guess
don 't make plans for dinner
my classmates are getting together and it 's couples only
i 'm not letting you go now
if anyone lets go it UNknown l be me
how did you come here ?
song ju sent me
and you came just because he sends you ?
we 'r e just friends
you said not to tell anyone we 'r e siblings or why yuri acted like she didn 't know you
who 's the one that asked me not to say anything ?
that 's the kind of man i am
so why listen to a jerk like me ?
i don 't care if it 's friends or siblings
i don 't want to lose anything more
don 't tell me to leave
you know i UNknown e got nowhere to go right ?
han jung suh !
i 'm all right
you even paint with your left hand
here it 's yours
or throw it away for that matter
i UNknown l remain as your sister
i don 't think i can keep the promise i made to you
it seems jung suh can 't be happy by my side
that 's why we decided to remain friends
they say friends help each other when in need
that is the only thing i can do for you
i 'm sending jung suh back to you
please take good care of my dear friend
i had a great time
jung suh the thing is
how should i say it ?
i 'm too young to know for sure
but i wonder if what i feel for you now is love
han jung suh !
come get jung suh right now
i UNknown e got nothing more to say
jung suh 's sick !
even when she 's delirious she only asks for you
cha song ju !
i don 't care if you come or not
you heard me
i 'm leaving okay ?
i 'm so sorry
i won 't let you go
yes her fever 's gradually coming down but it 's still high
she doesn 't seem to have any other symptoms but she should go to a general hospital later
and have her rest for now
i 'm not going to be your friend anymore
just get better
call me when you get this message
is it as difficult for you ?
i can 't forget you
it UNknown l get even harder
no matter how much i miss song ju you know i can 't go back right ?
get some sleep
jung suh be happy

romeo and juliet
you have UNknown yourself my dear
you have captured the heart of the most charming woman in the united kingdom
the countess of UNknown of whom it seems we both are fond
but the difference in their social station was an UNknown obstacle
every morning in hyde park
while kean 's only companion was the faithful solomon
they are your creditors kean
i 'm afraid we are trapped
and this man whose income is no less than that of the prince of wales has to dodge creditors
what are you thinking about mr kean ?
who is that sailor sir ?
don 't tell me countess that you don 't remember edmund kean
why the disguise ?
let 's go to the pub you old clown
i am commissioner in this district and a great admirer of your talent
edmund kean the great actor
and i am his only friend
morning had long since arrived
that 's the band that is to give a performance here
hey pistol !
and you my old friend bob !
my dear friends in a few days i will give a benefit performance of hamlet for old bob and the others
we are old friends madam
i used to be a travelling comedian like them
but you have become a great artist the most famous in your country
during their meeting at the UNknown hole tavern a cordial relationship developed between kean and the commissioner
i have a passion for the theatre mr kean
in my district i don 't miss a single UNknown nor a UNknown
what will you do ?
i love a player !
dear mr kean
it is a question of my future my whole life
i dislike and who is only after my money i 'm sure
because of this i have left my guardian 's house and will never return
and how do you expect to get along ?
i wish to dedicate myself to the theater
dear child !
i can show you the other side of the coin
this very day the countess of UNknown told us that everyone knows that kean attracts young girls
return home miss and remain calm
i will try to reduce to nothing the UNknown of this malicious man
dear mr kean
an hour later at the home of the countess
this kean has abducted her and is hiding her at his house
allow me madam to present you with the truth in order to end this slander of the reputation of a young girl
excuse me count but this is a secret a woman UNknown only to another woman
tomorrow i play hamlet
at the foot of the orchestra is a door leading to my dressing room
i pray that you will come to me there
it is a great slander to accuse mr kean of being involved with miss UNknown
kind souls what weep you when you but behold our caesar 's UNknown wounded ?
look you here here is himself UNknown 'd as you see with traitors
think of your art
take these to the countess at once !
an appreciation from mr edmund kean
from mr edmund kean
and these are the roses i sent to my beloved !
this is truly a royal card
your royal highness please allow me to donate your hundred pounds to the poor actors
let us allow mr kean to get dressed your majesty
i hope that i will have the chance to converse with your highness
i UNknown l join you in a moment my dear count
your majesty i am in love with
when i saw you enter here i knew i could no longer pretend to be mad
i shall applaud you nonetheless
from your box your highness ?
one should be careful with precious possessions !
what an accursed profession !
we are masters neither of our pleasures nor our sorrows
all is UNknown !
to be or not to be that is the question !
be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow
thou shalt not escape UNknown
thou shalt not escape UNknown
oh royal prince whom i believed to be a friend
i am a poor comedian
my lords and gentlemen !
the performance cannot continue
the great and famous actor edmund kean has lost his reason
as time went by the countless debt claims and failures in private life took a final UNknown on kean 's spiritual and physical powers
kean lay slowly dying in the humble abode of solomon in a distant london suburb
i feel that i am dying my dear UNknown
read read shakespeare to me
alas poor UNknown !
louder solomon louder
your voice sounds as if it is coming from the depths of a tomb
where be your UNknown now ?
your UNknown ?
alexander died alexander was buried alexander UNknown into dust ; the dust is earth ; of earth we make UNknown
UNknown caesar dead and turn 'd to clay
i am dying

we have missed our home and our land
the romans will build a fort on our soil

UNknown laughed at the order and threw me out of the UNknown !
UNknown i cannot bear it any longer
the council gives me confidence that we are ready to fight for freedom !
what do you say ?
there is only one way
fight for freedom and justice !
unity will give us strength !
rome 's honor has been injured !
we must wipe out germany !
so i 'm alone !
no you 'r e not alone !
germany calls for a leader !
you have to guide us through the struggle for freedom !
end of fourth act 5th act
the romans are preparing for war
help UNknown !
UNknown 's call is heard
from all the counties come armed men
when i return my dear you will be mine !
you coward !
a few steps from the grave UNknown UNknown !
UNknown the traitor !
let me fight with you or perish !
when evening came the battle was decided
all is lost !
victory is ours
the return from battle
the victory celebration

this is the story of a boy who tried it
while employed as a moving picture operator is a small town theater he was also studying to be a detective

or that i must not forgive her for not UNknown the nature of that monster
for not being aware of what she was getting into
and especially that i went along without thinking
because i wasn 't a fanatical nazi
i could have said in berlin
no i 'm not doing it
i don 't want to go to the f UNknown 's headquarters
but i didn 't do that
i was too curious
but nevertheless i find it hard to forgive myself
the ladies are here
november 1942 UNknown east prussia
sit down ladies
he UNknown l see you in a short while
can you tell us
the f UNknown first speaks to you and then you reply
heil mein f UNknown
that won 't be necessary since the f UNknown isn 't looking for a soldier but for a secretary
act as normal and calm as you can
i UNknown l see if he has time for you
mein f UNknown the ladies from berlin are here
thank you for coming in the middle of the night
sometimes during a war one is not in control of time
can i ask your name ?
frankfurt am main mein f h
hannah UNknown born and raised in berlin
in UNknown to be precise
UNknown brandt from UNknown UNknown
and you are ?
my UNknown won 't hurt you
she 's very intelligent
first sit down please
you won 't make nearly as many
you 'r e very young
how old are you ?
22 mein f UNknown
i did it
you 'r e right
it 's the russians
happy birthday mein f UNknown
the city centre of berlin is under fire
grenades have hit near the UNknown UNknown and the UNknown
where did they come from ?
we don 't know yet
i have UNknown on the line
give me UNknown
no i 'm in UNknown UNknown
berlin is chaotic
the enemy has no railway artillery near the UNknown
it 's not long range artillery
the UNknown aircraft defence near the zoo bunker reports they 'r e 10 to 12 UNknown UNknown
the russians have positions near UNknown
that 's only 12 kilometres from the centre
are the russians that close ?
they should hang the entire luftwaffe leadership
this is unheard of
nobody told me anything
that railway bridge over the UNknown
party bosses everywhere
the f UNknown starts UNknown today
berlin as a front city
he won 't be able to keep the city
if the f UNknown stays here the reich will go down with him
we have to talk him out of it
talk to UNknown
UNknown tried everything
why not ?
we must try everything
you UNknown l be a father soon
do you want to die here ?
what 's going on ?
we 'r e leaving
and who 's going to look after the people and the soldiers ?
don 't ask me professor
this is insane
is that so ?
and when there 's fighting all over the city where does he get it ?
as department head i report to the ss and to himmler
but as a doctor i 'm part of the UNknown and they 'r e not leaving yet
keep that in mind
get him the proper papers
we 'r e leaving
the brown UNknown is the worst
they say 's ieg heil but they think lick my you know what
mein f UNknown i beg you
too late ?
i 'm sure you agree we should contact the allies and start conducting politics
i 'm fed up with it
when i 'm dead you UNknown l have plenty of time for politics
it 's good dear himmler
my loyal heinrich
what did you expect from a vegetarian UNknown ?
seriously though UNknown
berlin will fall in a couple of days
when the f UNknown 's dead who will the allies negotiate with ?
why do you think they UNknown l negotiate with you ?
the nazi state and my ss are needed to maintain order
one hour with eisenhower and he UNknown l feel the same way
the first contact has been made
careful that 's high treason
UNknown i have other concerns
should i give eisenhower the nazi salute or shake his hand ?
look at that
leaving already gentlemen ?
the scorched earth order
come and see me one day in UNknown
i 'm going north to help with the battle of berlin there
you know UNknown
it 's easier to clean up debris than to demolish everything ourselves
when the war will be over reconstruction will be quick
we spent thousands of hours together with these UNknown
you 'r e a true genius UNknown
skyscrapers and hotels
we see before us the ancient cities the UNknown
we see the medieval cities the UNknown and we know that the people need that
mein f UNknown if you want to realize these plans you must leave berlin
eva you say something
he knows what 's best
you must leave berlin
i can 't do that my child
i would be like a lama priest with an empty prayer wheel
i have to solve the problem here in berlin or perish
UNknown what do you think ?
you have to be on the stage when the curtain falls
to play at war ?
i want my son
you 'r e still young
at which front did you fight ?
i haven 't had the honour yet
count yourself lucky
which position ?
the russians will come from two sides and you won 't be able to get out
we UNknown l shoot back
what with ?
the russians will arrive with several armies tanks and heavy artillery
do you really think you UNknown l last even five minutes ?
we promised the f UNknown
don 't you understand ?
the war is lost
the 9th army had to retreat or they would have been UNknown
we won 't retreat the 9th army
UNknown must fight where he stands
f UNknown then the 9th army is lost
we UNknown l push back the soviet armies in the north and east with a ruthless mighty attack
using which units ?
the 9th army is unable to move
the enemy UNknown us ten times
UNknown 's 12th army must support them
the 12th army is approaching the UNknown
then it must turn around
then the western front would be open
do you doubt my orders ?
i think i UNknown e been clear enough
the allies will see that only we can stop the bolsheviks
we have to keep berlin and make a deal with the americans
UNknown you 'r e here
mein f UNknown
you will be the commander of the defensive circle around the citadel
we UNknown l fight until the last man in berlin
there are still three million civilians here
they have to be evacuated
i understand your concern UNknown
but we have to be cold as ice
we can 't spend any energy on so called civilians
with all due respect what will happen to the women and children and the thousands of wounded and elderly ?
in a war such as this one there are no civilians
the f UNknown has lost all sense of reality
he 's moving divisions around that no longer exist
UNknown steiner has been scattered yet steiner must attack
he doesn 't listen to reason
something has to happen
we 'r e soldiers
and that 's coming from you ?
a ruthless UNknown ?
where were you ?
i 'm proud of you
this boy took out two tanks using UNknown tank shells
his name is peter UNknown
so you 'r e peter
i wish my generals were as brave as you
and when UNknown will rise from these ruins you will be the heroes
heil to you
what will happen to us ?
i could go if i wanted to
but everybody is deserting him
we can 't all go can we ?
i can 't go either
i wouldn 't know where to go
my parents and all my friends warned me
don 't get involved with the nazis
what should i say
when things went wrong i admitted my mistake
life will go on
we have to go
wherever the enemy goes all they find is destruction
that 's the death sentence for the german people
no power no gas no drinking water no coal no traffic
if you destroy everything our country will go back to the middle ages
this order denies the people any chance of survival
if the war is lost what does it matter that the people are lost too ?
the primary necessities of life of the german people aren 't relevant right now
on the contrary
our people turned out weak and according to the laws of nature they should die out
they 'r e your people
you 'r e their f UNknown
what remains after this battle is only the inferior
the superior will have fallen
i 'd love to
you must convince him
you UNknown l die
i want to dance
as long as it swings
it 's like a dream you can 't get out of
it keeps on going
to the west ?
be sensible general
i 'm commander of the citadel now
i need help
you 'r e a doctor aren 't you ?
yes an UNknown
i UNknown l do my best
what about ?
why am i going to be executed ?
you know that any evasive manoeuvre towards the west is forbidden
officers who don 't obey must be executed
what do you mean ?
my troops have been fighting for days
my command post is a UNknown away from the front line
i don 't want you to use that tone with me
and now do whatever you feel you must
it 's best if you tell this to the f UNknown yourself
orders from brigade f UNknown UNknown
i have to get into the hospital
we need medication
i 'm going to have a look
you stay here
see that ?
behind it is UNknown land
may i ?
i should have been back by now
are you sure the f UNknown still needs me ?
but you don 't think steiner will attack do you ?
i doubt whether steiner is able to do anything but you probably know that better than i do
if steiner doesn 't attack berlin is lost
the f UNknown was impressed with your report
he puts you in command of the defence of berlin
i 'd have preferred it if he executed me
let them get closer
is it german artillery that i hear ?
i 'm afraid not
you have to go as fast as you can
time is running out
steiner will make all the difference
he says it will change military history
everybody but the f UNknown knows that 's a fantasy
i even wonder if he believes it himself
why would he be playing games ?
what does he have to lose ?
i don 't believe a word of it
the enemy made a breakthrough
they took UNknown and are advancing towards UNknown
they 'r e at the northern city border between UNknown and UNknown
in the east they reached UNknown UNknown and UNknown
if steiner attacks everything will be alright
mein f UNknown
the attack didn 't take place
the following stay here
that was an order
how dare you ignore my orders ?
is this what it came to ?
the military everybody lied to me
even the ss
i don 't allow that
cowards traitors and UNknown
the generals are the scum of the german people
no sense of honour
for years the military UNknown me
all you ever did is UNknown me
i should have had all the high officers executed
like stalin did
but i conquered all of europe on my own
such enormous betrayal of the german people
but all these traitors will pay
with their own blood
how can i be a leader under these circumstances ?
it 's over
i 'd rather shoot a bullet through my head
do what you want
frau UNknown frau christian
everything is lost
you can 't send me away
i 'm staying too mein f UNknown
now what ?
do you want us to stop fighting ?
that 's inconceivable
no more november 1918
nobody can replace him
the f UNknown 's confused
he UNknown l recover
we owe it to him
or it will be too late
you 'r e only looking after yourself
mind your words
it 's all over
even the f UNknown doesn 't believe in it anymore
what will happen to us ?
g UNknown says there 's a tunnel that goes under the russian lines
why did you say you wanted to stay with him ?
i don 't know
let 's go down again
where do they come from ?
the UNknown is under the direct command of dr goebbels
i want them to go away from there
this is insane
i think this is wrong
what is all this ?
these men are on the run
traitors will be killed
who 's going to stop me ?
you maybe ?
can you operate ?
and not too much UNknown
that 's no longer needed
can you look after them for a moment ?
your UNknown is an easy prey for the russians
they have neither combat experience nor good weapons
their unconditional belief in the final victory makes up for that
herr minister without weapons these men can 't fight
their deaths will be pointless
i don 't pity them
the people called this upon themselves
this may come as a surprise to you
don 't fool yourself
they gave us a UNknown
and now they 'r e paying for it
eva you have to leave the f UNknown
don 't be stupid
how can you say that ?
where are you ?
does my sister know where you are ?
think about it
children your room is to the right
wait for me
line up children
do you remember the song ?
the best thing to do is to shoot yourself in the mouth
you won 't feel a thing
you UNknown l be dead right away
i want to be a beautiful corpse
i UNknown l take poison
if i have to die at least without any pain
that 's definitely painless
a matter of seconds
berlin 23 april 1945
but this is how it is
it could be over any moment
first of all
but i 'm sure you UNknown l see him again
he UNknown l get through this and he UNknown l fight from bavaria
the f UNknown lost all hope of a good outcome
maybe someone will allow me to send you a last greeting
i stayed with daddy against his will
last sunday the f UNknown wanted to help me escape
but you know your mother
we have the same blood
i won 't even think about it
our UNknown 's going down the drain and with it everything that made life beautiful and worthwhile
after the f UNknown and national socialism there 's nothing left to live for
that 's why i brought the children too
they 'r e too good for the life that awaits them
god will have mercy on me if i bring them redemption myself
i UNknown l wear my bracelet with the green stone until the very end
after that i want you to always wear it
unfortunately my diamond watch is with the UNknown
i included the address below
i hope you 'r e lucky enough to get it
i want you to get it
you UNknown l also get the bracelet with the UNknown pendant
a birthday present from the f UNknown
i owe some money to the UNknown company
there may be more debts but no more than 1500 UNknown
all correspondence with the f UNknown must be burnt
i 'm sending you some food and tobacco
the coffee is also for UNknown and UNknown
the cigarettes are for UNknown the tobacco for daddy the chocolate for mummy
i can 't think of anything else
that 's it for today
dear sister i wish you lots of happiness
and remember you will see hermann again
the UNknown regards and a kiss from your sister
go to d UNknown and help him with the organisation
things have to be started up again
i don 't understand you
we have no more oil fields
that 's UNknown
when everything has been solved here we must get the oil fields back
any questions ?
do you agree that i take charge with complete freedom of action ?
if i receive no reply by UNknown hours i UNknown l assume you have been UNknown
i will then act on behalf of the country and the motherland
that 's high treason
if our communication system fails we UNknown l be cut off from the outside world
we won 't be able to issue orders anymore
i think g ring wants to seize the power
i never trusted his UNknown on the UNknown
this looks like a coup
the loser the UNknown
how dare he say i 'm UNknown ?
it wasn 't easy but i must speak to the f UNknown
if i were you i 'd wait a bit
for that alone he should be executed
this morphine addict corrupted the country
and now this
and in case i don 't survive the war he must be executed immediately
what 's going to happen to us ?
is there any hope left ?
frau UNknown leave from here before it 's too late
the f UNknown wants to stay
we can 't leave him behind can we ?
he doesn 't need anybody for what awaits him
and least of all you
but herr goebbels and his wife stay here
and the children
why don 't you leave with the children magda ?
you can hide until everything 's over
it won 't be long now anyway
i thought about it
think about it
if national socialism dies there will be no future
i can 't believe you really want that
you wouldn 't desert the f UNknown
i UNknown e come to say goodbye to the f UNknown
i 'm going back to hamburg tonight
of course you must go
i couldn 't leave it behind
please you must not have eaten all day
that 's true
it shows him you 'r e on his side
did he ever doubt that ?
lately he often thought you were against him too
i always said you 'd come and here you are
i think he liked it that you advised him to stay in berlin
i also think it 's best
and you know it may sound strange but i 'm really happy here
and i 'm not afraid
nobody understood me
the opportunities we had
i don 't find it hard to continue
one brief moment and then eternal peace
but please spare the people mein f UNknown
if my people cannot endure this ordeal i won 't shed a tear
they get what they deserve
they called this fate upon themselves
for months i have to tell you this for months i have sabotaged your orders for destruction
i not only ignored your orders but even acted against them
i had to tell you
this never compromised my personal loyalty to you
so you 'r e leaving
eat well gentlemen
loyalty and courage still exist in this world
ritter von UNknown and UNknown UNknown UNknown how good
that the both of you arrived more or less unharmed
from there we couldn 't continue
we flew in a UNknown UNknown over the russian lines and landed on the east west axis close to here
before landing the soviets had a go at us
general von UNknown i appoint you supreme commander of the luftwaffe
i hereby promote you to general UNknown
a big responsibility rests on your shoulders
you have to rebuild the luftwaffe from scratch
many mistakes have been made
this so called humanity is religious drivel
compassion is an eternal sin
to feel compassion for the weak is a betrayal of nature
the strong can only triumph if the weak are UNknown
being loyal to this law i UNknown e never had compassion
i UNknown e always been ruthless when faced with internal opposition from other races
and that 's the only way
apes for instance kill all the odd ones
and what applies to apes must definitely apply to humans
himmler made an offer to surrender to the allied powers
via count UNknown
that 's the worst betrayal
g ring he was corrupt
always has been
all the others yes
he must have told them i 'm sick
maybe even dead
and get UNknown
he must be available
i want a report immediately
please stay here doctor
fly to d UNknown
we UNknown e decided to die with you
thank you for this proof of loyalty
but himmler must die
mein f UNknown ?
this is part of a huge decoy operation
i UNknown e allowed the enemy to invade the reich and they think they UNknown e won
but mark my words they have another thing coming
d UNknown is UNknown in the north
UNknown in the south
from prague three armies will attack the russians simultaneously from the back
i didn 't know we still had so many reserve troops
i made sure you UNknown l soon have a 1000 of the most modern jets at your disposal
with those you can make the luftwaffe ready for battle again
i kneel to your genius at the altar of the motherland
heil mein f UNknown
mein f UNknown as you know all medical departments that fall under the ss and himmler have left berlin
himmler is a traitor
mein f UNknown as UNknown ss i have no more work here
your request to leave berlin is unacceptable
i take all the responsibility
we UNknown l talk about it later
UNknown UNknown UNknown cannot be found
he 's not in the bunker
what you can 't find UNknown ?
ernst is something wrong ?
search the room
you can 't have hermann executed can you ?
there 's no doubt
everything 's over
she 's pregnant by hermann
he UNknown with himmler
no compassion for them
what 's the point of that ?
it is my wish
there are no more reserves
supplies from the air are impossible
there is no ammunition coming in anymore
in the north the russians are standing in front of the UNknown bridge
in the east
how long can you hold out ?
at most two days
it 's surrounded
that 's what young people are for
what you suggest is insane
we can 't help them
mein f UNknown the orders have been written
i give you my word
the f UNknown cannot make a UNknown disappearance from world history
even if an advance is successful i UNknown l end up in another troublesome situation
i 'd have to stay in the open air or on a farm and wait for the end
UNknown is advancing with the 12th army
he can join the 9th and give the russians the final blow
UNknown 's an excellent fellow
send a telegram to keitel
immediately report to me the following
you UNknown l see gentlemen
i UNknown l be right
UNknown will come
it 's unlikely that UNknown 's small amount of troops
what 's unlikely about the offensive ?
UNknown can 't do anything anymore
then why don 't you tell the f UNknown that ?
has everybody gone mad ?
do you think the f UNknown doesn 't know ?
he UNknown l never surrender
and neither will we
during those 30 years i learnt to think act and live out of love and loyalty for my people
international UNknown and its allies
what is it herr minister ?
he ordered it
but i will ignore this order
i UNknown l stay with the f UNknown
please frau UNknown i want to dictate my will to you
i 'm typing the f UNknown 's will
mein f UNknown are you of aryan descent ?
can i see your identity card ?
you 'r e talking to the f UNknown here

UNknown you too
but when i think about it i know nothing about him
even though he likes to talk
i longed for berlin but he 's so different now
he only talks about dogs and vegetarian food now
i hate UNknown
i think he doesn 't want anybody to really know him
he can be so caring in his private life
and then he uses that rude language again

troy dream and reality
UNknown thousands to her unknown regions
UNknown pass was the great barrier to the gold fields
over this pass men faced UNknown misery and hardship
many lost their lives
but the brave went on
far into the icy north deep into the silent nowhere came an UNknown lone prospector
and somewhere in that nowhere was another lone prospector
with cheerful optimism our little columbus descended then stopped stepped slipped and slid
now let me see thought the little fellow
before i know where i am i must get there
there in that frozen wilderness a dream came true and a lone voice UNknown into the solemn sky
but the elements laughed roared and UNknown
in that raging nowhere was a lone cabin and another lone man black larson an UNknown UNknown scoundrel
out of the lashing storm came the little fellow to find shelter and perhaps a little hospitality
there he sat resting his weary bones as the icy wind UNknown through the UNknown
come here said larson
big jim was the noble type
he had suffered
he suffered about everything
or i UNknown l fill you both full of lead
now then the pair of you get out !
i UNknown l stay right here understand ?
right here said big jim
yes sir he UNknown l stay right here said the little fellow
the cabin UNknown and UNknown
two men walked and never talked hunger UNknown their bones
i must have food ! yelled big jim
i must have food !
what are you eating ?
said black larson
one of us must brave that storm if we 'r e to get food
come here the pair of you
we UNknown l cut the cards and the low man goes
you 'r e the man said jim
goodbye good luck
somewhere in that nowhere the law was looking for black larson
desperate with hunger and here it was thanksgiving day
nevertheless there was something to be thankful for
not quite done yet give it two more minutes
come on come on said big jim
after UNknown the country for food the little fellow had to admit he had seen nothing not even a field mouse
from the pangs of hunger
big jim was becoming delirious hysterical
in fact he was a pain in the neck
food food ! he UNknown
i can put another shoe in the pot
no no anything but that !
poor jim he couldn 't take it
what 's the matter ?
said the little fellow
well build up the fire said big jim
what 's the matter with you ?
said the little fellow
don 't be childish
you ! said jim
you go inside
chicken or no chicken the little fellow looks appetizing to big jim
meanwhile black larson stumbled onto big jim 's mountain of gold
then came the parting of the ways
big jim to his mine our hero to his fate
goodbye said the little fellow
it 's been a great pleasure knowing you
treachery awaited big jim at his mountain of gold
big jim looked deep into the eyes of black larson and saw there the soul of a skunk
caught in a UNknown of desperate deeds
black larson swept on to UNknown doom
and out of a dream in that frozen waste a city grew
and humanity warmed it with living loving and UNknown
georgia was quick and impulsive proud and independent
in the evening georgia worked as a dancehall girl
jack had lots of appeal for georgia
perhaps that 's why she resented him
out of the night came the little fellow towards the dancehall that beacon light of pleasure that retreat of lost dreams
georgia why aren 't you nice to jack ?
i believe he really likes you said the girl
he likes everybody said georgia quite UNknown
i 'm bored with this place she continued
i 'd give it all up if i could find someone honest and worthwhile
don 't worry i UNknown l find him someday
then she turned and looked and looked and looked
kinda fresh ain 't ya ?
me and you are gonna dance
hey there pan out a tune
just a moment i said we 'r e gonna dance
i beg your pardon said georgia
to show her utter contempt for jack she picked out the most deplorable looking tramp in the dancehall
hey you come here
you see i 'm very particular about whom i dance with
and there he stood the UNknown cavalier guarding her sanctuary
if you wanna make a hit with your lady friend
you should put your hat on straight like this !
take that you
hank curtis cabin was a stone 's throw from the dancehall
hank was a mining engineer who lived alone and occasionally went on long expeditions into the far north
hank was kind and human and our hero cold and hungry and the beans smelled good and the coffee was steaming hot
so the little fellow devised a way of getting breakfast
big jim recovered from the blow he received from black larson but lost his memory
hank 's partner arrives
hank informs his partner that the little fellow is to look after the cabin while he 's away
goodbye said hank
since that night in the dancehall the little fellow hadn 't seen georgia but an incident was to bring them together again
there she stood her loveliness lighting the room filling his soul with the music of romance for which he was so ill fitted
as she introduced her friends his heart began to sing
as they warmed up by the stove he excused himself to get firewood
and in that cabin his secret was revealed his love for georgia
and the girls UNknown and laughed perhaps in order to hide their pity
for in the world of the dancehall it wasn 't wise for the girls to reveal their hearts
and so they thought they 'd have a little fun with him
there in the UNknown they sat their faces alight with mischief but all the while his heart was singing
and so she fooled and flirted and UNknown his hair
he knew she was fooling but he was happy
for she was near him holding his hand smiling at him
nice place you have here said georgia
i hope you will invite us again
what if she were fooling ?
he was enjoying the warmth of her attention
and the lady was enjoying the warmth of his chair
and now she was leaving
the light of her loveliness would be gone
and he would be left with an emptiness to return to his bleak lonely existence
pardon me said the little fellow
would you really like to come again ?
of course said georgia
we UNknown l come for dinner new year 's eve said the ladies
very well said georgia
of course at that moment georgia would forget her gloves !
for the next few days the little fellow UNknown and UNknown in order to buy that new year 's dinner
the eve of a new year
new hopes and new dreams
and there was georgia caressing him with her smiles and tender glances
and the girls called for a speech
but he was too happy to speak
all that mattered was georgia was there
i can 't make a speech but i UNknown l do a dance
and a dance he did with the rolls
should auld acquaintance be forgot
and never brought to mind
should auld acquaintance be forgot
and days of auld lang syne
for auld lang syne my dear
for auld lang
let 's go up and visit the little fellow she said
we UNknown l have some fun with him said jack
we UNknown l send georgia in first then give him a scare
oh forget it said jack
how about giving me a little attention ?
a day or so later in the recorder 's office
big jim tried to convince the UNknown that he had a mountain of gold
where is this place ? they said
but big jim 's memory had failed him
all he knew was that it was near the cabin
the cabin that 's it !
f i could find my way to the cabin i could find the mine
but i can 't remember
hey ! said jack georgia 's been looking for you
the little fellow knew otherwise
how dare that cad mention her name so lightly ?
for two pins he 'd give him another thrashing
however being a little UNknown he would ignore the insult
but it was true
georgia had written him a letter
and as he went looking for georgia so big jim went looking for him
you you ! said big jim
the cabin the cabin !
where is it ?
can 't you speak man ?
tell me !
where is it ?
to your feet man quick !
you 'r e coming with me !
take me to the cabin and i UNknown l make you a millionaire !
georgia you don 't have to explain
i 'm going away and when i return
i shall come back
ah ! said big jim it won 't be long now
bring in the eats and tomorrow we UNknown l start for the mine
here take a swig of this
it UNknown l put hair on your UNknown
my this is a heavy lamb chop said the little fellow
then fate it 's always fate played its little joke and again the elements laughed roared and UNknown but through it all our heroes soundly UNknown
then came the dawn
oh well may as well tidy up and get breakfast
this is the worst liver attack i UNknown e ever had
feel that rocking ?
let 's go to the other side
we UNknown l see how far it will go over
something must be missing underneath
i UNknown l go outside and see what it is
now said big jim don 't get excited
take it easy don 't move don 't breathe !
i said don 't breathe stupid
you can be most annoying at times
if you UNknown l only be cool be calm said big jim
we have nothing to worry about
now show a little character !
where 's your willpower ?
now listen i UNknown e got a very good idea
hold your hands like this then i can get out first
you see what i mean ?
said big jim
now we shall be rich said jim
we shall be millionaires !
and so they were
to live laugh and indulge themselves in the lap of luxury
they were famous and sought after by the press
in their cabin deluxe they were welcomed and waited upon
the reporter wanted to write the little fellow 's life story
from rags to riches and he graciously consented
and big jim was UNknown
not the nails said he the corns
the reporter thought of a good idea to have the little fellow pose in his mining clothes
it would make a human story
neither knew of the other 's presence
georgia overheard the officer say there was a stowaway aboard
you ! said georgia
and then she mistook him for the stowaway
the officer was going to put him in irons
but georgia pleaded for him and said she would pay his fare
heck ! said the captain
that 's no stowaway
then of course there were apologies
the little fellow gathered himself together
james the valet was told to prepare for an extra guest
pardon me said the reporter but who 's the lady ?
buzz buzz buzz !
and so it was
UNknown thousands to her unknown regions
UNknown pass was the great barrier to the gold fields
over this pass men faced UNknown misery and hardship
many lost their lives
but the brave went on
far into the icy north deep into the silent nowhere came an UNknown lone prospector
and somewhere in that nowhere was another lone prospector
with cheerful optimism our little columbus descended then stopped stepped slipped and slid
now let me see thought the little fellow
before i know where i am i must get there
there in that frozen wilderness a dream came true and a lone voice UNknown into the solemn sky
but the elements laughed roared and UNknown
in that raging nowhere was a lone cabin and another lone man black larson an UNknown UNknown scoundrel
out of the lashing storm came the little fellow to find shelter and perhaps a little hospitality

big jim to his mine our hero to his fate
goodbye said the little fellow
it 's been a great pleasure knowing you
treachery awaited big jim at his mountain of gold
big jim looked deep into the eyes of black larson and saw there the soul of a skunk
caught in a UNknown of desperate deeds
black larson swept on to UNknown doom
and out of a dream in that frozen waste a city grew
and humanity warmed it with living loving and UNknown
georgia was quick and impulsive proud and independent
in the evening georgia worked as a dancehall girl
jack had lots of appeal for georgia
perhaps that 's why she resented him
out of the night came the little fellow towards the dancehall that beacon light of pleasure that retreat of lost dreams
georgia why aren 't you nice to jack ?
i believe he really likes you said the girl
he likes everybody said georgia quite UNknown
i 'm bored with this place she continued
i 'd give it all up if i could find someone honest and worthwhile
don 't worry i UNknown l find him someday
then she turned and looked and looked and looked
kinda fresh ain 't ya ? thought jack
get down off that high horse
me and you are gonna dance
hey there pan out a tune
just a moment i said we 'r e gonna dance
i beg your pardon said georgia
to show her utter contempt for jack she picked out the most deplorable looking tramp in the dancehall
hey you come here
you see i 'm very particular about whom i dance with

you should put your hat on straight like this !

hank curtis cabin was a stone 's throw from the dancehall
hank was a mining engineer who lived alone and occasionally went on long expeditions into the far north

hank 's partner arrives
hank informs his partner that the little fellow is to look after the cabin while he 's away
goodbye said hank
since that night in the dancehall the little fellow hadn 't seen georgia but an incident was to bring them together again
there she stood her loveliness lighting the room filling his soul with the music of romance for which he was so ill fitted
as she introduced her friends his heart began to sing
as they warmed up by the stove he excused himself to get firewood
and in that cabin his secret was revealed his love for georgia
and the girls UNknown and laughed perhaps in order to hide their pity
for in the world of the dancehall it wasn 't wise for the girls to reveal their hearts
and so they thought they 'd have a little fun with him
there in the UNknown they sat their faces alight with mischief but all the while his heart was singing
and so she fooled and flirted and UNknown his hair
he knew she was fooling but he was happy
for she was near him holding his hand smiling at him
nice place you have here said georgia
i hope you will invite us again
what if she were fooling ?
he was enjoying the warmth of her attention
and the lady was enjoying the warmth of his chair
and now she was leaving
the light of her loveliness would be gone
and he would be left with an emptiness to return to his bleak lonely existence
pardon me said the little fellow
would you really like to come again ?
of course said georgia
we UNknown l come for dinner new year 's eve said the ladies
very well said georgia
of course at that moment georgia would forget her gloves !
for the next few days the little fellow UNknown and UNknown in order to buy that new year 's dinner
the eve of a new year
new hopes and new dreams
and there was georgia caressing him with her smiles and tender glances
and the girls called for a speech
but he was too happy to speak
all that mattered was georgia was there
i can 't make a speech but i UNknown l do a dance
and a dance he did with the rolls
should auld acquaintance be forgot
and never brought to mind
should auld acquaintance be forgot
and days of auld lang syne
for auld lang syne my dear
for auld lang
let 's go up and visit the little fellow she said
we UNknown l have some fun with him said jack
we UNknown l send georgia in first then give him a scare
oh forget it said jack
how about giving me a little attention ?
a day or so later in the recorder 's office
big jim tried to convince the UNknown that he had a mountain of gold
where is this place ? they said
but big jim 's memory had failed him
all he knew was that it was near the cabin
the cabin that 's it ! f i could find my way to the cabin i could find the mine
but i can 't remember
hey ! said jack georgia 's been looking for you
the little fellow knew otherwise
how dare that cad mention her name so lightly ?
for two pins he 'd give him another thrashing
however being a little UNknown he would ignore the insult
but it was true
georgia had written him a letter
and as he went looking for georgia so big jim went looking for him
you you ! said big jim
the cabin the cabin !
where is it ?
can 't you speak man ?
tell me !
where is it ?
to your feet man quick !
you 'r e coming with me !
take me to the cabin and i UNknown l make you a millionaire !
georgia you don 't have to explain
i 'm going away and when i return
i shall come back
ah ! said big jim it won 't be long now
bring in the eats and tomorrow we UNknown l start for the mine
here take a swig of this
it UNknown l put hair on your UNknown
my this is a heavy lamb chop said the little fellow
then fate it 's always fate played its little joke and again the elements laughed roared and UNknown but through it all our heroes soundly UNknown
then came the dawn
oh well may as well tidy up and get breakfast
this is the worst liver attack i UNknown e ever had
feel that rocking ?
let 's go to the other side
we UNknown l see how far it will go over
something must be missing underneath
i UNknown l go outside and see what it is
now said big jim don 't get excited
take it easy don 't move don 't breathe !
i said don 't breathe stupid
you can be most annoying at times
if you UNknown l only be cool be calm said big jim
we have nothing to worry about
now show a little character !
where 's your willpower ?
now listen i UNknown e got a very good idea
hold your hands like this then i can get out first
you see what i mean ? said big jim
your mind is chaotic
now we shall be rich said jim
we shall be millionaires !
and so they were
to live laugh and indulge themselves in the lap of luxury
they were famous and sought after by the press
in their cabin deluxe they were welcomed and waited upon
the reporter wanted to write the little fellow 's life story
from rags to riches and he graciously consented
and big jim was UNknown
not the nails said he the corns
the reporter thought of a good idea to have the little fellow pose in his mining clothes
it would make a human story
neither knew of the other 's presence
georgia overheard the officer say there was a stowaway aboard
you ! said georgia
and then she mistook him for the stowaway
the officer was going to put him in irons
but georgia pleaded for him and said she would pay his fare
heck ! said the captain
that 's no stowaway
then of course there were apologies
the little fellow gathered himself together
james the valet was told to prepare for an extra guest
pardon me said the reporter but who 's the lady ?
buzz buzz buzz !

in their cabin deluxe they were welcomed and waited upon
the reporter wanted to write the little fellows life story
UNknown UNknown and he graciously consented
and big jim was UNknown
UNknown said he UNknown
it would make a human story
neither knew of the others presence
georgia overheard the officer say there was a stowaway aboard
you ! said georgia
the officer was going to put him in irons
but georgia pleaded for him and said she would pay his fare
heck ! said the captain
then of course there were apologies
the little fellow gathered himself together
james the valet was told to prepare for an extra guest
UNknown said the reporter UNknown UNknown ?
and so it was a happy ending
ripped with UNknown 1 17 and verified by UNknown UNknown UNknown com
i deliver perfection and don 't brag about it ! d
in the great gold rush alaska was the hope and dream of men the ruthless siren of the far north UNknown thousands to her icy bosom
UNknown thousands to her unknown regions
UNknown pass was the great barrier to the gold fields
over this pass men faced UNknown misery and hardship
many lost their lives
but the brave went on
far into the icy north deep into the silent nowhere came an UNknown lone prospector
and somewhere in that nowhere was another lone prospector
with cheerful optimism our little columbus descended then stopped stepped slipped and slid
now let me see thought the little fellow
before i know where i am i must get there
there in that frozen wilderness a dream came true and a lone voice UNknown into the solemn sky
but the elements laughed roared and UNknown
in that raging nowhere was a lone cabin and another lone man black larson an UNknown UNknown scoundrel
out of the lashing storm came the little fellow to find shelter and perhaps a little hospitality
there he sat resting his weary bones as the icy wind UNknown through the UNknown
come here said larson
big jim was the noble type
he had suffered
he suffered about everything
or i UNknown l fill you both full of lead
now then the pair of you get out !
i UNknown l stay right here understand ?
right here said big jim
yes sir he UNknown l stay right here said the little fellow
the cabin UNknown and UNknown
two men walked and never talked hunger UNknown their bones
i must have food ! yelled big jim
i must have food !
what are you eating ?
said black larson
one of us must brave that storm if we 'r e to get food
come here the pair of you
we UNknown l cut the cards and the low man goes
you 'r e the man said jim
goodbye good luck
somewhere in that nowhere the law was looking for black larson
desperate with hunger and here it was thanksgiving day
nevertheless there was something to be thankful for
not quite done yet give it two more minutes
come on come on said big jim
after UNknown the country for food the little fellow had to admit he had seen nothing not even a field mouse
from the pangs of hunger
big jim was becoming delirious hysterical
in fact he was a pain in the neck
food food ! he UNknown
i can put another shoe in the pot
no no anything but that !
poor jim he couldn 't take it
what 's the matter ?
said the little fellow
well build up the fire said big jim
what 's the matter with you ?
said the little fellow
don 't be childish
you ! said jim
you go inside
chicken or no chicken the little fellow looks appetizing to big jim
meanwhile black larson stumbled onto big jim 's mountain of gold
then came the parting of the ways
big jim to his mine our hero to his fate
goodbye said the little fellow
it 's been a great pleasure knowing you
treachery awaited big jim at his mountain of gold
big jim looked deep into the eyes of black larson and saw there the soul of a skunk
caught in a UNknown of desperate deeds
black larson swept on to UNknown doom
and out of a dream in that frozen waste a city grew
and humanity warmed it with living loving and UNknown
georgia was quick and impulsive proud and independent
in the evening georgia worked as a dancehall girl
jack had lots of appeal for georgia
perhaps that 's why she resented him
out of the night came the little fellow towards the dancehall that beacon light of pleasure that retreat of lost dreams
georgia why aren 't you nice to jack ?
i believe he really likes you said the girl
he likes everybody said georgia quite UNknown
i 'm bored with this place she continued
i 'd give it all up if i could find someone honest and worthwhile
don 't worry i UNknown l find him someday
then she turned and looked and looked and looked
kinda fresh ain 't ya ?
me and you are gonna dance
hey there pan out a tune
just a moment i said we 'r e gonna dance
i beg your pardon said georgia
to show her utter contempt for jack she picked out the most deplorable looking tramp in the dancehall
hey you come here
you see i 'm very particular about whom i dance with
and there he stood the UNknown cavalier guarding her sanctuary
if you wanna make a hit with your lady friend
you should put your hat on straight like this !
take that you
hank curtis cabin was a stone 's throw from the dancehall
hank was a mining engineer who lived alone and occasionally went on long expeditions into the far north
hank was kind and human and our hero cold and hungry and the beans smelled good and the coffee was steaming hot
so the little fellow devised a way of getting breakfast
big jim recovered from the blow he received from black larson but lost his memory
hank 's partner arrives
hank informs his partner that the little fellow is to look after the cabin while he 's away
goodbye said hank
since that night in the dancehall the little fellow hadn 't seen georgia but an incident was to bring them together again
there she stood her loveliness lighting the room filling his soul with the music of romance for which he was so ill fitted
as she introduced her friends his heart began to sing
as they warmed up by the stove he excused himself to get firewood
and in that cabin his secret was revealed his love for georgia
and the girls UNknown and laughed perhaps in order to hide their pity
for in the world of the dancehall it wasn 't wise for the girls to reveal their hearts
and so they thought they 'd have a little fun with him
there in the UNknown they sat their faces alight with mischief but all the while his heart was singing
and so she fooled and flirted and UNknown his hair
he knew she was fooling but he was happy
for she was near him holding his hand smiling at him
nice place you have here said georgia
i hope you will invite us again
what if she were fooling ?
he was enjoying the warmth of her attention
and the lady was enjoying the warmth of his chair
and now she was leaving
the light of her loveliness would be gone
and he would be left with an emptiness to return to his bleak lonely existence
pardon me said the little fellow
would you really like to come again ?
of course said georgia
we UNknown l come for dinner new year 's eve said the ladies
very well said georgia
of course at that moment georgia would forget her gloves !
for the next few days the little fellow UNknown and UNknown in order to buy that new year 's dinner
the eve of a new year
new hopes and new dreams
and there was georgia caressing him with her smiles and tender glances
and the girls called for a speech
but he was too happy to speak
all that mattered was georgia was there
i can 't make a speech but i UNknown l do a dance
and a dance he did with the rolls
should auld acquaintance be forgot
and never brought to mind
should auld acquaintance be forgot
and days of auld lang syne
for auld lang syne my dear
for auld lang
let 's go up and visit the little fellow she said
we UNknown l have some fun with him said jack
we UNknown l send georgia in first then give him a scare
oh forget it said jack
how about giving me a little attention ?
a day or so later in the recorder 's office
big jim tried to convince the UNknown that he had a mountain of gold
where is this place ? they said
but big jim 's memory had failed him
all he knew was that it was near the cabin
the cabin that 's it !
f i could find my way to the cabin i could find the mine
but i can 't remember
hey ! said jack georgia 's been looking for you
the little fellow knew otherwise
how dare that cad mention her name so lightly ?
for two pins he 'd give him another thrashing
however being a little UNknown he would ignore the insult
but it was true
georgia had written him a letter
and as he went looking for georgia so big jim went looking for him
you you ! said big jim
the cabin the cabin !
where is it ?
can 't you speak man ?
tell me !
where is it ?
to your feet man quick !
you 'r e coming with me !
take me to the cabin and i UNknown l make you a millionaire !
georgia you don 't have to explain
i 'm going away and when i return
i shall come back
ah ! said big jim it won 't be long now
bring in the eats and tomorrow we UNknown l start for the mine
here take a swig of this
it UNknown l put hair on your UNknown
my this is a heavy lamb chop said the little fellow
then fate it 's always fate played its little joke and again the elements laughed roared and UNknown but through it all our heroes soundly UNknown
then came the dawn
oh well may as well tidy up and get breakfast
this is the worst liver attack i UNknown e ever had
feel that rocking ?
let 's go to the other side
we UNknown l see how far it will go over
something must be missing underneath
i UNknown l go outside and see what it is
now said big jim don 't get excited
take it easy don 't move don 't breathe !
i said don 't breathe stupid
you can be most annoying at times
if you UNknown l only be cool be calm said big jim
we have nothing to worry about
now show a little character !
where 's your willpower ?
now listen i UNknown e got a very good idea
hold your hands like this then i can get out first
you see what i mean ?
said big jim
now we shall be rich said jim
we shall be millionaires !
and so they were
to live laugh and indulge themselves in the lap of luxury
they were famous and sought after by the press
in their cabin deluxe they were welcomed and waited upon
the reporter wanted to write the little fellow 's life story
from rags to riches and he graciously consented
and big jim was UNknown
not the nails said he the corns
the reporter thought of a good idea to have the little fellow pose in his mining clothes
it would make a human story
neither knew of the other 's presence
georgia overheard the officer say there was a stowaway aboard
you ! said georgia
and then she mistook him for the stowaway
the officer was going to put him in irons
but georgia pleaded for him and said she would pay his fare
heck ! said the captain
that 's no stowaway
then of course there were apologies
the little fellow gathered himself together
james the valet was told to prepare for an extra guest
pardon me said the reporter but who 's the lady ?
buzz buzz buzz !
and so it was
i UNknown l be turning seven soon
i 'm the youngest in my family
my family is UNknown ; UNknown mom and dad
and uncle a 3 generation family
so it 's a very rare case of a big family and
that 's why people envy us
but granddad 's got a disease
of waking up very early
wake up !
hey son don 't waste your time !
i don 't wanna see our train leaving without us !
you better move fast too !
what are you doing hurry up !
not before daybreak !
please calm down
let me go on my own !
put down your bag !
your so obstinate !
uncle are you drunk again ?
you smell awful !
i 'm not a kid any more
don 't look at me that way !
i hate that !
so yeah husband
what 'r e you doing at this hour ?
let 's go to sleep
but i don 't !
have a good sleep !
UNknown come back to sleep
husband come in
no insect free certificate ?
we have big trouble without that !
i know but
don 't get me wrong i need less expensive
i need rat poison !
don 't even think of hiding your ass ever !
i am so busy at work so let me talk to you
you 'r e dead if i don 't have my money
back by the end of the month
so i filled it out
it looks fine ?
and a true heart is needed to make my dream come true
i feel too
hey UNknown !
i said now !
just do as you 'r e told to i UNknown l feed you
wait ma 'a m
i mean it i can 't wait !
you ungrateful pig !
you call yourselves actors ?
you two just did an awful job !
you get away !
how UNknown !
you used to be an actress right ?
on stage sir
show how into UNknown you are !
hello mom ?
his 2nd wife in the north y UNknown now
stop it !
who knows ?
having two wives is UNknown UNknown ?
it 's a modern version of UNknown !
in 3 months ?
but you should be prepared
just be the best as you can as his days are running out
the 11th family reunion from south and north will be
not a day went by without him missing his family in the north
now he UNknown l go soon without ever seeing them again
what a miserable guy !
i think this is the last chance of being a good son UNknown
i can create a kind of UNknown drama as a last gift to him
so just 10 000 would be
enough to cover this realistic drama
let me do this !
i UNknown e got two words ; UNknown row up !
how are you doing ?
can i see you tomorrow ?
this is your father 's will
he 's got property to inherit
he bought some land a long time ago
i don 't think it 's a lot of money but
i know he prepared it for his family in the north but
i don 't believe he can see them alive so
something he should decide on concerning the land
only if korea is UNknown
if not it goes to the ministry of UNknown
well the real estate market is up and down
so it 's worth 4 5 million at most
okay just give this matter to me
i UNknown l take care of everything
trust me it UNknown l be 5 million in 3 months !
father how are you feeling ?
he should UNknown e kept his mouth shut !
i would like you to
forget it i know what you 'r e going to say
dad sorry but
and my business is down so
oh my daughter
how much ?
oh no !
that 's okay
he UNknown l buy it for sure !
as a result
speaking of which
you do it i UNknown l support it
let 's be good boys
but i want you to understand
even if it 's not working as planned
you guarantee it 's perfect !
sure i do
mom the key is our love for dad no more no less
just forget about what 's 't rue or false
dad is sure to be happy and
this could be the best the best
how impressive man !
honey our kids are becoming insane !
UNknown UNknown oh
remember this is only between you and me huh ?
12 000 ?
in terms of quality anything less than that and we don 't have art !
we 'r e film makers
not artists !
but it should be well made !
one more disappointing thing is
you billing for being an assistant and an actor as well
how selfish i thought we 'r e more than that !
i came up with the film title !
UNknown out of our hands
is it your idea ?
sure i am smart
please do 's UNknown
look at me man !
i told you look me in the eyes
9 000 got it ?
this is a title yes
UNknown out of our hands ?
what a stupid sounding title !
out of our fingers is better
that sounds odd UNknown ut of our fingers ?
it doesn 't
you win !
you 'r e telling me it costs too much ?
just one wedding costs 9 000 !
now you think it 's too much to do a UNknown UNknown of a country ?
you can 't find any director that 's up to this job
make it with 10 000 !
then you 'r e okay with crap ?
not well made ?
12 000 is all i have so don 't charge me any more
do your job right got it ?
remember your part is crucial
you just visit him sick in bed and give him prep words and
the moment our mission kicks in the regular tv show is interrupted
and our UNknown ell made show on the UNknown begins
don 't miss the key moment and start to UNknown on our own
you just make him feel the excitement
i got it we 'r e like real actors
then we UNknown l need a script at least
let me show you something
oh my god !
he has survived another critical moment but the end is near
come on in guys
it 's not as bad as it looks !
look this space can be the stage
and we UNknown l make room for editing
and install a computer
just imagine you 'r e under a luxurious spotlight
ready action !
came to agree to peaceful UNknown
i was scared to death !
just do what you can do
feel free to do it naturally
two governments at last came to an UNknown
guess what ?
for the historical event
you shouldn 't be lying like this !
you finally can get back home !
right then we should turn on the tv
here dad your glasses
the two governments of korea finally
agreed to the peaceful UNknown of korea
today is the greatest day of our lives ever
as of today
i declare the official UNknown of korea to the whole world !
your dream came true dad
i can 't believe this !
so there 's no more UNknown no more war
we 'r e one again after 50 years !
in a shorter time we can visit south and north at any time
your lifelong dream finally comes true
why do you cry ?

look it 's true it snows a lot in the north
you can 't imagine how thrilled people are here
president UNknown and chairman kim had a meeting
to discuss after post UNknown issues over lunch
they came to conclusion that to arrange the family reunion is
how impressive !
i 'm scared
not only the mines but also the UNknown hurt and hostility
this is the american camp wordsworth 2nd division
they agreed that
the u s has officially announced
they UNknown l withdraw their troops step by step
hey come on in
that makes me much happier
this project is going wild
you know how many letters there are in the alphabet ?
easy as pie 26 period
no 11 count
very funny !
you just passed
what place would you be in ?
no you 'r e still in the 2nd !
what 's going on ?
what 's the problem ?
it looks like it 's broken
how about taking a walk for some fresh air
i said it 's okay
you need fresh air !
i think this show is funny !
nothing is funny
it 's been a while since you UNknown e been out like this !
should i like this ?
it 's freezing
thanks how 's your business ?

even from the north
father hold still !

here we go !
how come you didn 't know about it ?
chicken fried rice !
did i order this much ?
what 's all this about ?
what we need is a party
to commemorate the UNknown !
i wish UNknown happened every single day
think about our people starving in the north we shouldn 't do this !
but today can be an exception
so forget about the bus
yeah right father don 't worry about a thing
no one has pity on me except a half of my husband
sure more than anything
nothing i 'm just dying to see my step sister and first mother
it 's natural
i UNknown e waited for as long as 50 years
my sister must be happy
i UNknown e invested my blood money and you take a nap damn unfair !
move your ass !
without money no project no UNknown !
you couldn 't be doing this shit
without my help
but i 'm afraid this project lasts too long
hey let me get my jacket from under your butt
just wait it UNknown l end shortly
you 'r e saying 's UNknown ?
it looks like decades at least !
what happened ?
are you all right ?
can you hear me ?
let me see him
who are you ?
we don 't know
i saw an idiot dressed really stupid
he was wearing a UNknown
no kidding !
for the record you don 't see us smoking alright ?
could you let me know how i can buy a ticket to UNknown ?
but i don 't know how
don 't worry i know where there is a booth
thank you son
oh i see
so you just stay here
blind money for cigarettes !
and you ?
if you insist just go by yourself
but i am worried about your health !
what if something happens to you on the way ?
we promised we would go with you
we 'r e your kids too
we love you and care for you !
don 't we even exist to you ?
how come you do as if we 'r e not !
i just wanted to buy a ticket
believe me i UNknown l go to the north with you
you are home most of the time
no film going on ?
i 'm at work at home you didn 't know ?
it 's a killing cold
let me carry you on my back
doesn 't it sound great if we go to UNknown right away ?
let 's go to the hometown
clear the way i 'm carrying dad to where he got started !
your idea sounds awesome but
i am afraid it goes too far
no 's UNknown whatever for an undercover operation
to prepare for when we 'r e really UNknown
germans were under great confusion
for not preparing the UNknown
they were ?
even how much they should pay for the bus ticket
so we need to practice in advance helping them out !
how come you made a big fuss out of nothing !
the government should UNknown e done this earlier it 's great !
i 'm afraid this is just a bother
let 's stop nagging
we participate in the political stuff
at least we need to be rewarded or what would UNknown us ?
don 't you ?
there is a prize for the person with the highest score
10 000 !
enough to buy a new car
be kind and you can get a new car
how many credits are needed to win the money ?
i UNknown e got no idea
just act and talk as if we 'r e united
all will be UNknown
your son is a director right ?
your family must be good at it
you can say that again
how are you feeling today sir ?
very well thanks
she has a plan to go to UNknown ?
i am happy for her
take care on your trip with her
have a nice day sir
your business is doing better
thanks to the UNknown ?
you 'r e back honey
you kids are happy too because of the UNknown
sure our one and only wish was to be united
we should be one as we used to be my teacher says
i hate UNknown
you come here
i told you UNknown is the key to a better life huh ?
your brain is full of stupid cartoons ?

i UNknown l take care of the money part
what did they say ?
only part of the circus is available

UNknown art circus

the moment they arrive this circus reaches different level
open the door
UNknown circus doesn 't have that
this is bullshit

you led all these innocent people
to do shitty job
but you didn 't care for dad ever !
you are right bastard !
it was my fault
i feel so heart stricken to see
dad back sick in bed so
i thought we did the right thing seeing dad so happy
but UNknown feel even more guilty
i don 't know
he must be heart broken not to see his family !
i know how much you felt betrayed by us for this shit !

but it does to me
just imagine not being able to see
your blood family
i have something for you to inherit
you the oldest kid
donate the rest the way i wish
i have never been happier
than these few weeks
it was more than amazing
granddad 's last words were that
if you are not allowed to see your loved ones it 's sad
and leaving them behind is UNknown than that
but he added with a big smile
he wishes the day will come
when we won 't hear of such sad stories
i wish the day will come soon

you can use this opportunity to enrich yourself
the way you flirted with UNknown was perfectly scandalous
my dear UNknown
end of act 1
vienna the beautiful the joyous !
and its beautiful women who are the envy of the world !
mr counselor come with me without delay !
otherwise we will lose our places !
six hours later most of the people in the queue

just now both girls knocked at the cellar window
this is my husband
the innkeeper allowed us to sleep in the stable
keep the whole piece !

i have a home to go back to
end of act 2
the corps of officials will be UNknown

and the next day 1000 !
if it makes you happy i will get 100
UNknown the owner of the office
well miss UNknown you seem tired today
did you overdo it last night with your boyfriends ?
you need a small advance ?
this time invest in something secure
like english money or american
i prefer to place it in things that will go up quickly
i suggest you invest in UNknown
it will certainly go up
we will start the rumor
when the stock falls
then we will make a 100 profit
this means that we are rich people !
we must celebrate that we have suffered for long enough
what is this ?
go to UNknown 's and buy a new coat
at the carlton
well davy !
isn 't it a beautiful city with beautiful women ?
of course james

tomorrow i will move from the hotel
i will find lodgings with the people
where did you leave madam lia ?

she will rejoin us soon
when a lady arrives have her enter immediately
end of act 3
did i ever press you if you couldn 't pay immediately ?
it is private
it is for my husband

dear doctor something has happened
something horrible happened to his wife
she was choked in a hotel on UNknown street and robbed
it 's done
but he had a moustache and a beard
were you able to see anything ?
the matter does not concern you madame UNknown
i must spend a little time with your customers
sir you match the description of the murderer
i must arrest you
i am a diplomat
please excuse me counsel
don 't be afraid
arrest that man down below in the street
we were forced to free him just now
end of act 4
i am ready to flee with you
because you robbed and murdered lia UNknown in order to make a killing in the stock market
regina how can you think such a thing ?
you do not like me otherwise you would not lie to me !
are you still going to say that you don 't have boyfriends ?
i will not remain here another moment !
go walk the streets where you belong you little tramp !
i will not let you soil my office !
UNknown has fallen 10 points
you must sell now in order to save anything !
that is much too expensive
your UNknown and your indifference are unbearable
do you really have no wish ?
i would like you to take me to the house of UNknown
the stock market all is lost and what 's more i am in debt
father we will not die of hunger
you have your job
we should give more thought to renting the room
today my father lost all he had in the stock market
then you probably have an urgent need for money
can you lend me a little ?
we have nothing in the house
alas i have nothing myself
but a very rich uncle is coming to the cafe tomorrow
i will introduce you
i heard that you are looking for a waiter
room for rent
why are you so silent and never laugh ?
i would like the same hotel room that we had last night
look at UNknown
so noble so aristocratic !
why did you want this room ?
just to look at it
marie i don 't understand
do you have a secret ?
i have a secret and i will tell it to you
the other night after you had left
a woman was killed in the next room
then i looked in
who is it ?
i am lucky to find a room with so charming a hostess
it is a very nice room
what does it cost ?
miss UNknown i get 60 a month
so i can 't spend too much
i hope that we will become good friends
miss UNknown it is with great UNknown that i inform you of your father 's debts
this is all that we have
take it but say nothing to my father
i do not want to make him worry
the secret room of the pimp madame UNknown
he is already here
mr UNknown i am sorry about the other day you need not worry now
my affairs in vienna are finished
i leave tomorrow
and she told me the name of the assassin
it is egon UNknown the secretary to UNknown
she said no more and i cannot verify it
we do not lack anything
UNknown the cabbage isn t so bad
i want to eat to eat meat !
i need your help
but you have not been very kind to my uncle
i will be happy to help you one last time
allow me to introduce myself formerly attached to the stables of his majesty the tsar
at present the UNknown d for madame UNknown
upon my honor i will tell you straight out
i like you !
my word of honor !
tomorrow evening i will have a small private party
you must be there
yes you have to leave until the scandal is over
but why would i leave ?
bank employee suspected of murder
we have just learned that a bank employee egon UNknown was arrested for the murder of lia UNknown while preparing his escape
more details tomorrow
i plead not guilty
we talked about a stock market trade that would soon make me rich
because i did not have the necessary capital she proposed to put up her jewels for cash
i accepted this proposition
she was in good health and very happy
and why did you wear this false beard ?
a romantic whim of the murder victim
the small private party
these girls sleep with everyone
i asked you for a girlfriend and you give me that !
i am sorry sir
this cannot go on like this
but i will help you again
you will be in my show
do you understand ?
i will go looking for someone to fix the window
and a little girl came in and
took two cans of preserves from the closet
you lie !
i must ask you to leave this room
ah well old man you must pack your bags
you don 't know what women are like
these are poor girls who need money
let me make a suggestion in all friendship
i will take you to some places in vienna
where you will learn what these women are like
we must apologize to the lieutenant and tell him that he can remain here
he must eat or he will starve
end of act 7
the innkeeper has allowed us to live in his attic
why do you stare up there each night ?
it would be better if you returned to your parents
you are ill
then you will feel better
mother bring me a newspaper
will you lend me an egg and a little wood neighbor ?
the case of lia UNknown is over
the proof is overwhelming against egon UNknown even as he still UNknown his innocence
mother i committed a crime and i must pay
i was anxious to see you one last time
forgive me the sorrow i have caused you
i have left my parents
i love you
can you forgive me ?
i have always held you dearly
end of act 8
where is UNknown ?
change quickly into these clothes !

why have you done this ?
doubtless for the same reason as the other girls
to prevent my family from dying of hunger
die of hunger !
what about that ?
i was sent here to relieve the misery and i see only gold luxury and debauchery !
one cannot open any door without seeing misery in all its UNknown
it is my fault
i am too weak

bank employee suspected of murder
we have just learnt that a bank employee egon UNknown was arrested for the murder of lia UNknown while preparing his escape
more details tomorrow
29 UNknown 1921
we discussed a stock market trade that would soon make me rich
since i did not have the necessary capital she proposed to sell her jewels for cash
i accepted this proposition
she was in good health and in a good mood
and why did you wear this false beard that night ?
a romantic whim of the murder victim
the small private party
we all have been with these UNknown UNknown girls
i asked you for a cute little girl and you gave me this !
i am sorry sir
it cannot go on like that but i will help you again
i am going to have a live performance shortly
you will be in it agreed ? !
are you angry at me ?
i will get someone to repair the glass
and i tell you that the little UNknown took two cans of preserves from the cupboard
you lie !
i must kindly ask you to leave this room
oh well pal you must pack your bags
boy you know neither the world nor the women
you don 't know either how these poor viennese girls earn their living
let me give you a friendly suggestion
i will take you to some places in vienna where you can learn what these women are like
we must apologize to the lieutenant and tell him that he may remain here
he must eat properly !
end of act 7
the hotel owner has allowed us to live in his attic
why do you stare at this place every night ?
it will be better if you return to your parents
you are ill
mother bring me a newspaper
will you lend me an egg and some wood neighbour ?
the case of lia UNknown is over
the proof is overwhelming against egon UNknown even though he still claims his innocence
i committed a crime and must pay for that
forgive me the sorrow i have caused you
i have left my parents
i love you
can you forgive me ?
i have always loved only you
end of act 8
where is UNknown ?
change quickly !
why have you done this ?
probably for the same reason as the other girls otherwise i and my family will starve to death
listen to me !
i was sent here to relieve the misery and i see nothing but glitter luxury and immorality !
one cannot open a door without seeing misery in all its UNknown
it 's all my fault
maybe the butcher will give me something if i kindly ask him
please give me just a little my child is starving
yes i have enough meat but none for you !
he was killed by young women !
with the meat hatchet !
the attic is on fire
save the child !
several acts of UNknown systematically destroyed the film in germany while foreign versions were also UNknown cut or altered
the following reconstruction was UNknown together using foreign prints of the film
more than 600 of the film original 3 UNknown meters are still missing
this amounts to about one half hour of the film
out of the film 200 original UNknown only five remain
the UNknown of the UNknown is partially based on a 1926 UNknown report in which a UNknown version of the film was UNknown
the rest of the UNknown were taken from the original script or UNknown from foreign copies
as long as sections of the UNknown street remain lost any reconstruction is at best only an UNknown of the original version
the munich film museum edited this version of the film over a period of many years under the supervision of UNknown UNknown jan christopher UNknown and stefan dr UNknown
the music was composed by UNknown UNknown

take it but don 't tell my father
he mustn 't worry himself
the police demand we suspend your diplomatic rights so they can arrest you

if you don 't want no part of these because of how we got UNknown m then me and the kid wil take UNknown m
you 'r e gonna put UNknown m back in the safe with the rest of our stuff !
i 'm from police headquarters
mr arlington was one of my best customers
you were at mr arlington 's home UNknown weren 't you ?
did the man you saw with mr arlington look as if he would commit such a crime ?
the reason i ask is because sometimes the least little thing gives us a clue
i hate to see anybody tease a baby
i don 't like to take his toys from him
let 's finish our talk in the store
you sold a parrot to mr arlington
who delivered it ?
you forget easy don 't you ?
that dick has a line on us we gotta think fast !
he 's got a hunch hector UNknown this trick
let 's plant the jewels in the boob 's room !
that 's it !
that 's what we hired him for isn 't it in case we got in a jam ?
if i loved a man he wouldn 't have to have a dime !
then why have you let me go on hoping ?
aw i UNknown e just been kidding !
oh hector i tried so hard to let you know i love you
i UNknown e been a crook a pick pocket !
but you 'r e not going to be any more
i did some pretty bad things myself when i was young
gee but you UNknown e made this a great christmas rosie
gee but you UNknown e made this a great christmas rosie !
ain 't you the UNknown ?
no echo i 'm on the UNknown
i love him !
you UNknown l find out soon enough !
mcdonald 's alibi that he was at
mrs o UNknown UNknown bird store will be investigated by the police
that means more investigation but there ain 't goin to be no mrs o UNknown UNknown when they get here !
yes there is goin to be a mrs o UNknown UNknown that dick saw me here
you guys can get out of your make up but i can 't ! UNknown i ain 't going to the chair alone !
and neither is hector mcdonald going to the chair !
now laugh that off you big stiff !
what are you going to do ?
you UNknown l find out soon enough !
regan is on his way to o UNknown UNknown 's bird store
here 's one thing stronger that you and i might need him
it was spring before the grim machinery of the law worked around to the case of hector mcdonald
does the defendant 's attorney intend to produce the alleged witnesses mrs o UNknown UNknown and her grand UNknown ?
UNknown 00 59 51 540 00 59 56 050 we 'r e making every effort to locate them
while in a secluded cabin in the mountains
in his prison cell he sits
how about just us two UNknown the stuff ?
maybe i got a better UNknown
you can save him echo
and if you will i UNknown l stick with you
i UNknown l never see hector again
and the minute he 's free you 'd double cross me and go back to him
don 't you understand
i love him echo
after that you don 't want to change your mind about sticking with me ?
he would always have rosie if he saved hector
this was the thought that took echo secretly to the city
your honor i object !
he is UNknown stating the evidence !
objection over ruled !
when you get there keep repeating the lord 's prayer
move your lips but don 't utter a sound
have faith in miracles
your honor may the defendant take the stand again to give new evidence ?
in a case so serious as his with a man 's life at stake the court cannot reasonably deny your request
speak louder !
there was an old woman who was a man and two others the unholy three
first it was an old woman and her grand daughter
now the old woman is a man !
what next ?
i didn 't say a word !
and it must be remembered that defense has failed to produce a single witness to confirm the prisoner 's story !
you mean you want me to go with you ?
there 's a fortune for just us two to split
what do you say ?
do you think he 's guilty ?
will he get the chair ?
i 'm echo the ventriloquist
grandma o UNknown UNknown of the UNknown UNknown three !
your honor i want to make a full confession !
the law can be kind
and echo 's confession won freedom for both himself and hector
i can 't explain but always UNknown i love you hector
i love you
we don 't love each other
you run along to hector
do you really mean that echo ?
good by old pal !
that 's all there is to life friends a little laughter a little tear
faces of chlldren
the mayor 's house
because there is sorrow in the house
the mayor pierre UNknown
where is mama ?
he 's had a shock nothing iife threatening
a few days rest and he 'i i be himself again
canon UNknown the priest of UNknown was jean 's godfather
and for UNknown iife returned to UNknown and he managed as weii as could be expected
it hurt him to see his children ieft on their own his home poorly cared for
and this torn sleeve !
every night jean whispered a prayer to his mother
staring at the portrait as he did he thought it came to iife and smiled at him
like every sunday
her daughter UNknown
so the insurance company UNknown the regulations didn 't pay anything
and spring returned
the first sunday in june
jean i have business to see to
you go alone
i 'm going to spend a few days with my old friend father UNknown
how are the children ?
i 'm going to remarry
the house is empty and there 's no one to take care of iittle UNknown
it would be the best thing for the children
what about jean
no not yet
i think you 'd better prepare him gently
the next day
i 'i i get out of your way
i think you 'd explain it better than me
he 's a good boy but he 's so sensitive
i have an idea !
i 'i i take jean with me to UNknown for a few weeks
then i can gently break the news to him there
and when he comes home things wiii have returned to normal and he 'i i adapt without too much trouble to the new situation
the next day at dawn the priest set off with his godson
having got through the pass they went down into the next UNknown
by UNknown they could see the UNknown of UNknown
at the end of the hay UNknown
saint UNknown celebrated the marriage of its mayor
when you get home you 'i i find some changes jean
your father is going to remarry
your duty my child is to also think of your loved ones
do you want to see your sister UNknown brought up badly and your papa iiving sad and alone for the rest of his iife ?
do i have to caii her mama too ?
weii then caii her mother
at the end of the month
his heart heavy but fuii of good intentions
jean set out on the road home
he saw things again as if he 'd been away for years
before he even crossed the threshold the house already seemed different
what do i want ?
i want to get into my own house that 's what !
mama said i wasn 't to iet anyone in
sure but i 'm jean
i iive here
you sleep in the smaii room in the back
you have to iisten to me because i 'm your mama now
then i 'i i love you and you 'i i be my iittle boy
i want you to be cheerful
i don 't iike children who UNknown or who daydream
they 'r e just UNknown
yes ma 'a m
the foilowing sunday
what 's the matter ?
from the first weeks the UNknown between the children was evident
UNknown and jean always played on their island far from UNknown who couldn 't play with them
where 's your hat ?
one day they cleaned out the attic
the UNknown is good
it 's not yours
why did you do that ?
answer me !
my UNknown !
it 's too iate to go iooking for it now
the evening at home
i 'm sure your UNknown feii near the bridge
it 's not far
jean had merely hoped that UNknown would get a scolding
he began to see the seriousness of what he had done
the only solution to admit everything right away
are you sick ?
come inside and pray
but the image seemed distant and faded
even the portrait had abandoned him
the next morning
jean thought he had become an object of horror to his family
he felt iike a criminal
dear papa goodbye
since you forgive me wiii you give me a kiss ?
pension mimosas and la UNknown h ro que produced almost half his work before the UNknown arrived
he began in UNknown at UNknown and in 1921 had his first international hit with l 'a UNknown based on the novel by pierre UNknown t
UNknown his second independent film which came out a year later was in a more realist vein
it related the UNknown of a street merchant struggling with french justice
the faces of children project started as a commission from two producers in UNknown
dimitri de UNknown and arthur UNknown who thought the director of l 'a UNknown could produce a work of international UNknown
a unique film directed and written by UNknown
faces of children owes a lot of its psychological truth to UNknown 's own family situation
and especially to the support of his wife and collaborator
fran UNknown UNknown
abel UNknown 's own UNknown he 'd already worked on UNknown the technical UNknown of which had contributed to UNknown 's reputation as a master
for faces of children
like the great swedish films of UNknown UNknown m and UNknown
UNknown and UNknown also pulled off some technical feats
like the night scene lit purely by torches when the villagers search for the girl
lost in the snow
even more surprising is this avalanche scene with the camera UNknown on the UNknown as it UNknown down the mountain
the critics of the time appreciated this authenticity already evident in l 'a UNknown for which UNknown had shot several UNknown in the sahara
for faces of children cheating was not an option
UNknown simply took his whole crew to switzerland to the UNknown UNknown and shot the UNknown there during the spring and summer of 1923
real peasants some of whom had never seen a camera before or even been in a cinema were the extras providing much depth to scenes
like that of the funeral UNknown and the wedding scene shot in the village of UNknown
only the UNknown of the UNknown and the chapel buried under snow were shot in UNknown studios in paris as were some link shots
besides its authenticity what still strikes us about the film is the very modern way it looks at unhappy childhood without sentimentality
french films had featured children since before the war but only as cute and amusing puppets
no one thought of studying them as real characters
so UNknown was making a radical UNknown from the usual UNknown and UNknown by telling a UNknown story without literary credentials or comic relief
to do this he had a small but significant asset
jean forest a kid of the streets of montmartre who 'd been in UNknown a natural actor of incredible sensitivity
once the film had been shot a disagreement between UNknown and the distribution company
les UNknown films UNknown UNknown meant that the reels were seized and UNknown had to wait a year to complete the editing
faces of children finally came out in march 1925 and was immediately UNknown by the critics as a UNknown although the public stayed away
at the same time the original french titles were restored from two 17 UNknown prints in its collection
faces of children is a UNknown masterpiece about the world of childhood
the mayor 's house
because there is sorrow in the house
the mayor pierre UNknown
where is mama ?
he 's had a shock nothing life threatening
a few days rest and he UNknown l be himself again
canon UNknown the priest of UNknown was jean 's godfather
and for UNknown life returned to normal and he managed as well as could be expected
it hurt him to see his children left on their own his home poorly cared for
every night jean whispered a prayer to his mother
staring at the portrait as he did he thought it came to life and smiled at him
like every sunday
her daughter UNknown
so the insurance company UNknown the regulations didn 't pay anything
and spring returned
the first sunday in june
jean i have business to see to
you go alone
i 'm going to spend a few days with my old friend father UNknown
how are the children ?
i 'm going to remarry
the house is empty and there 's no one to take care of little UNknown
it would be the best thing for the children
what about jean
no not yet
i think you 'd better prepare him gently
the next day
i UNknown l get out of your way
i think you 'd explain it better than me
he 's a good boy but he 's so sensitive
i have an idea !
i UNknown l take jean with me to UNknown for a few weeks
then i can gently break the news to him there
and when he comes home things will have returned to normal and he UNknown l adapt without too much trouble to the new situation
the next day at dawn the priest set off with his godson
having got through the pass they went down into the next valley
by nightfall they could see the UNknown of UNknown
at the end of the hay UNknown
saint UNknown celebrated the marriage of its mayor
when you get home you UNknown l find some changes jean
your father is going to remarry
your duty my child is to also think of your loved ones
do you want to see your sister UNknown brought up badly and your papa living sad and alone for the rest of his life ?
do i have to call her mama too ?
well then call her mother
at the end of the month
his heart heavy but full of good intentions
jean set out on the road home
he saw things again as if he 'd been away for years
before he even crossed the threshold the house already seemed different
what do i want ?
i want to get into my own house that 's what !
mama said i wasn 't to let anyone in
sure but i 'm jean
i live here
you sleep in the small room in the back
you have to listen to me because i 'm your mama now
then i UNknown l love you and you UNknown l be my little boy
i want you to be cheerful
i don 't like children who UNknown or who daydream
they 'r e just lazy
yes ma 'a m
the following sunday
what 's the matter ?
from the first weeks the UNknown between the children was evident
UNknown and jean always played on their island far from UNknown who couldn 't play with them
where 's your hat ?
one day they cleaned out the attic
the material is good
it 's not yours
why did you do that ?
answer me !
my doll !
it 's too late to go looking for it now
the evening at home
i 'm sure your doll fell near the bridge
it 's not far
jean had merely hoped that UNknown would get a scolding
he began to see the seriousness of what he had done
the only solution to admit everything right away
are you sick ?
come inside and pray
but the image seemed distant and faded
even the portrait had abandoned him
the next morning
jean thought he had become an object of horror to his family
he felt like a criminal
dear papa goodbye
since you forgive me will you give me a kiss ?

the lost world
UNknown sir arthur UNknown doyle author of the story
i have wrought my simple plan if i give one hour of joy
to the boy who 's half a man or the man who 's half a boy
i do wish you wouldn 't for this are so much nicer as they are
but why can 't you love me gladys ?
now tell me what 's amiss with me
i will only marry a man of great deeds and strange experiences
a man who can look death in the face without UNknown !
in the office of the london record journal
i want your legal advice
UNknown challenger threatens to sue my paper for doubting his yarn about live UNknown
famous UNknown returns from south UNknown UNknown proofs of strange tale
he nearly killed three reporters i sent to interview him today !
mr UNknown couldn 't you send me on a dangerous assignment ?
all i need is an opportunity
you seem very anxious to lose your life !
have you been interviewing challenger malone ?
don 't apologize hurry over to UNknown hall and cover challenger 's lecture
reporters are barred but get in !
there 's sir john UNknown famous hunter and explorer
he 's here to check up on challenger 's cock and bull story
well malone we 'r e in for a lively session tonight the students are out in force to UNknown old challenger
challenger has made himself a public laughing stock by his tale about live UNknown !
what can he hope to gain by such lies ?
the back country of the amazon contains over fifty thousand miles of UNknown water ways
who can say what may be living in that jungle as vast as all europe ?
but how can challenger 's story be true ?
these creatures have all been dead ten million years !
you might at least do him the justice to hear him state his own case
reporters are barred if i show my press pass i UNknown l get kicked out
i wonder if you
that 's UNknown UNknown the eminent UNknown
owing to lack of proofs this society cannot sponsor UNknown
challenger 's statement but is glad to afford him this opportunity to state his case and we trust clear his name
bring on your UNknown !
bring on your UNknown !
i will if any of you UNknown worms are brave enough to go back with me into the UNknown jungles where these monsters live !
i told you old challenger is sincere !
and i 'm not here tonight to defend my statements but to demand that a committee be formed to go back to the lost world with me
looks like a riot
when dealing with UNknown minds it is useless to appeal to reason for they have none !
i am calling for volunteers !
volunteers to face death or worse for the sake of science
i am sixty seven years of age but because i think you are a liar and a fraud
i accept your challenge sir !
i 'm neither a student nor a scientist but i 'd like to be counted in on this !
my friend sir john UNknown !
professor challenger i 'd like to go on this expedition !
probably the brain of a child but the body of an athlete
edward e malone
london record journal
eleven UNknown park UNknown west !
professor challenger i UNknown e got to go on this expedition !
this man attacked me !
do you give him in charge sir ?
sir john UNknown is a friend of mine
why didn 't you mention that before ?
you UNknown e hurt another nice young man !
i saw you from the dining room window !
if my husband gets UNknown again just call me !
you betrayed a glimmer of intelligence just now while talking to the policeman
sit down !
have you shown malone the diary ?
property of maple white ?
miss white was her father 's trained assistant
she will tell you why she came to me
i was in camp with jungle fever when my father went up to explore that terrible plateau
UNknown beast UNknown
a living brontosaurus
yes they were tremendous in size and UNknown
our bearers were so terrified they deserted carrying me back to the coast leaving my father marooned up there with those beasts
he would go in spite of what we had seen
my husband promised to raise funds for a rescue party but instead of getting people to help him he throws them out of windows and things !
why this is a great human interest story
and even if my paper was not convinced of the scientific value of your statements it might finance a rescue party provided that the exclusive publication rights
i UNknown l swear not to send an article back to my paper without your full approval sir !
if sir john UNknown will go with me i believe we can make my managing editor see this thing !
i 'm sure you know why i am going on this rescue party paula don 't you ?
eventually we found ourselves in that no man 's land which is formed by the half UNknown frontiers between peru brazil and UNknown
the sealed map we promised challenger to not open UNknown we arrived here is only a blank page
excepting a miracle our expedition seems to have come to a premature end
may i come in ?
from henceforth i take command of this expedition
let it be clear that you are all perfectly helpless without me !
if that UNknown beast is to go with us i remain behind !
jocko knows which berries and roots in the forest are edible and which are poisonous
he will be far more use to us than you my dear sir !
record journal party searching for lost scientist to make way into mystery world via secret rivers
may not be heard from UNknown for months
it 's a brazilian UNknown they always walk head downward
see the baby clinging to her ?
dear mr UNknown
maple white was marooned
in fact i don 't think
they 'r e not cubs but full grown spectacle bears great camp followers
paula says her father UNknown one of the trees on that UNknown so that it dropped across the UNknown and made a bridge
you can still see the stump of the old tree
in the morning we UNknown l climb the UNknown and drop the other tree over
a UNknown proving definitely that the statements in poor maple white 's diary are true !
a brontosaurus feeding merely on leaves
perfectly harmless unless it happens to step on us
who would believe this !
my elephant gun might as well be a bean shooter !
great guns !
we 'r e prisoners exactly like maple white !
that means our folk are still alive !
what are you thinking of paula in this lost world of ours ?
i was thinking if my father were still alive he would have seen our fire
and come to us
the barrier might as well UNknown down and fire may not work with the next one
we UNknown e got to find a safe camp !
jocko will be mighty lonesome down here without miss
paula he climbed that big rock this morning to get to her he can 't bear that girl out of his sight !
i have an idea !
after supper bring all those UNknown into the tent !
we must establish camp here our only refuge from these monsters if we UNknown l live long enough to search for your father
we can 't rest until every inch of this plateau is UNknown !
it 's miles in length your father may have found other caves
when i release the tree it will snap back with terrific force and by calculating the curve the rock will describe as it rushes through the air
a curve ?
a curve !
we UNknown l work all night and make enough ladder to get you in the morning
bring miss paula to call jocko he UNknown l climb anything to get to her !
there 's only a small cave above this but your father must be somewhere on the plateau it 's impossible to get away !
do you mean we are to be here always ?
what difference does it make where we are paula so long as we are together ?
but your engagement to UNknown ?
paula dear we 'r e as cut off from the world and its obligations and promises as if we were on the moon
i 'm going to ask professor UNknown to marry us
you know he used to be a minister
go hunt up the professors i have something to tell paula
a lovely specimen !
that UNknown volcano is waking !
the whole plateau will be covered in lava !
but this has been going on for hours i 'm afraid they 'r e lost
if they get back we must be here to show them the way to the tunnel opening
it 's their only hope of escape !
the professors and mr malone are safe they UNknown l be here in a minute or two !
i certainly hope that mud holds !
we 'r e back in the world and its obligations
why should we let gladys rob us of happiness paula ?
i can 't steal my happiness from another woman
i 'm major UNknown of the brazilian UNknown survey
yesterday i saw a cloud of smoke over the plateau
and we smoked out quite a rat major !
i 'd give my UNknown personal fortune to get that beast to london alive !
you could charter a steamer from there !
later in london
may i ask what you mean when you say proof professor challenger ?
a living brontosaurus nearly sixty feet long from the nose to the tip of the tail !
mr edward malone through whose efforts this expedition was UNknown is now UNknown the unloading of the monster from the ship we chartered
the message i have been expecting has come !
i UNknown l inform you in a moment when and where the brontosaurus will be on view !
as we swung the cage out over the dock the cables broke
the fall smashed the cage and it got out !
it 's running wild the streets are in an uproar !
my brontosaurus has escaped !
keep off the streets UNknown i recapture it !
this is outrage we UNknown e been UNknown again
challenger should be run out of town !
how d UNknown do gladys
you see i 'm back
and as you really owe it all to me i hope you UNknown l forgive me for not waiting
my husband percy potts
that was just my girlish whim !
percy is a clerk at a store and has never been out of london in his life !

francois the UNknown youngest son came into the world when the dissension between his parents was a fait UNknown
the family is a group of people living under the same roof who cannot stand each other
in a so called artistic cabaret in town

in the train that was bringing mr lepic back home
pretty maria was coming to see felix

and mrs lepic doesn 't like me because i take pity on him
carrot top !
i can 't take it no other boy could be as unhappy as me

13 this morning
stay on mackey all of his guys
you sure ?
your captain 's been relieved of duty
we need someone in an UNknown capacity
what was that about ?
he asked me to be the company yes man UNknown
told him to shove it
where 's his stash ?
it 's in there man
if we find the dead girl 's body you get this back
those drugs were never UNknown into evidence
wally called in one of my colleagues
we were able to id UNknown from her description
searched his vehicle UNknown the heroine and replaced it with a UNknown
vic likes me and my boy
he wants to take care of us
we can use that
whoever 's got the money
stop it !
get him out of here
get in the other room right now
get out of here
let me see hands
blacks are clean too
get a UNknown
tell the captain i said to send it
i see him hanging out in front of UNknown 's liquor on my way home
what the hell 's going on here ?
it 's like the second black and UNknown brawl this week
where do you live ?
last week some black guy went hit and run on a mexican kid
crushed his skull
UNknown took it on themselves
hunted the driver beat him to death
black hood jumped in killed two mexicans
went sideways ever since
who found her ?
do you have any metal UNknown ?
some of them don 't work well
any other witnesses ?
i would think so
the detectives will
let 's head in
what 's going on ?
captain 's calling a pep talk
yeah because when i think pep i think billings
as you probably know yesterday measure 16 on the city ballot failed
so it looks like those temporary budget cuts are now permanent
that will be 17 percent across the board
the chief wants you to know this is by no means a reflection of the fine job that you 'r e all doing for our city
of course not
and speaking of flying solo at six months officer UNknown might be mum on who the daddy is but she UNknown l gladly spill the beans on your new assignments
you guys keep up the good work all right ?
hey cheap bastards don 't wanna cough up a half a cent of sales tax screw them
next time somebody bitches p d didn 't show up tell them that could have bought two cops on time
so let 's keep showing up
everything else will even itself out
that 's right
we need to talk to the rest of UNknown 's class
the UNknown are at lunch
the entire class ?
hey hey hey
shots have been fired
it 's chaos on arrival
back off !
get the hell out of here
let me borrow that
vic wilshire east came through
set up a mobile field force
turn the goddamn fire hose on my kid ?
what was i supposed to do open fire ?
never stopped you all before
excuse me ma 'a m
i 'm david UNknown your councilman
i can assure you that it was the safest option to protect all these kids
have to bag him
may be our UNknown
i UNknown e already discussed it with her
you went into the bathroom ?
it 's my fault
that 's how murderers go free
murderers go free
it won 't happen again
it 's okay
she 's way too young for you
i am mature and distinguished
a lot of young women appreciate that
you really ought to cut back on the porn
please move back
either way he 's not graduating
you okay ?
i said i 'm fine
let 's give that to vic and we UNknown l stick with the stabbing
unfortunately all the UNknown are suspects and witnesses
they wanna talk to a captain
and i want more hair
you handle it
vic what do you got ?
armed and dangerous UNknown
you a member of the UNknown UNknown club weston ?
eleven of your classmates are in mission cross some critical one dead
and this puts you at the top of the most likely to be tried as an adult list
knife and gun did the damage
that don 't mean shit
i didn 't hurt nobody
UNknown pop tarts ?
what shit ?
all right all right all right
it 's a kill clock
some mexican 's gotta kill a couple brothers by tonight
who 's the mexican ?
if i knew that i wouldn 't be carrying the UNknown
that 's for being a UNknown
UNknown i might know what your stabbing 's about
guy thinks there 's a kill clock ticking
kill clock ?
he heard some mexican 's gonna try to kill two blacks
just UNknown ?
doesn 't matter
explains why our witness isn 't talking
how do i look ?
thanks for asking
and right now you 'r e the closest brown to our dead black girl
she died ?
by not talking you 'r e interfering with an investigation and that 's a crime
all right i saw him running out as i came in
and then i saw her by the sink all bloody and shit
who was it ?
vic and i should follow up on this
we UNknown l take over the cafeteria shooting
i UNknown l tell the captain we traded cases
why confuse him ?
something else ?
come in please
how can i help you lieutenant UNknown ?
you know that UNknown has been looking into detective mackey and the strike team he ran while under your command
captain UNknown began that investigation
i was aware of it
that investigation still UNknown ?
yes it is
what have i got ?
we UNknown e got UNknown
he lifted a brick of tar off the el UNknown
we UNknown e been waiting for it to spin into something more
which means you UNknown e got nothing on mackey
his day job 's keeping him busy
he hasn 't had the freedom to navigate much game
we UNknown e got a UNknown next to him and when he jumps dirty we UNknown l know
until then i was hoping that you might be able to help us out
you UNknown e got my letter and i UNknown e got nothing else to add
mackey 's your problem now not mine
no perception is your problem
i 'm going after mackey and his team
now you can get on board and be UNknown or you can sit back and UNknown
just like you did when he was running dirty on your watch
hey i did everything i could to rein him in
don 't sit there and threaten me with bad UNknown
you 'r e right
hey i 'm sorry
this is a lawsuit waiting to happen
i just wanna get him before he does any more damage
p d is looking for a poster boy for corruption
they crucify one of their own the public will trust the rest
and next time that ballot measure it passes
when you were captain mackey and UNknown were interrogated about the shooting death of a detective terry crowley
from the notes it 's very clear that you thought mackey was involved
and your comrades ruled it line of duty
i was hoping you might be able to shed some light on the UNknown
though rumour has it that the feds might have been involved with that
is that true ?
you followed it through even after you left the job
now that 's the man that i would want to be mayor
i would vote for that man
vic and his guys are tight
and UNknown he 's a soldier
he UNknown l follow mackey anywhere
but he 's also the one with a conscience
you 'r e gonna need something to drive a wedge between him and mackey
i need that wedge councilman
i need that wedge
i don 't want that guy 's stink on me anymore
what kind of proof ?
detective crowley 's deal with justice
that 's good
it 's juicy fruit
it 's a sign they UNknown l crack under pressure
look how big you got
wait a minute
you want that ?
mexican on black
you need me to sign them ?
look i know it pays the rent but UNknown work is a roll of the dice
we UNknown e had a good six months but you should get out before you get hurt
i need that money vic
what else am i gonna do ?
you 'r e worried about us
i just want this to end on good terms
now tell me you UNknown l think about it
i UNknown l let you know
we 'r e still putting the pieces together trying to get a clear picture
well what the hell started it ?
we don 't have a motive yet but we have a suspect
rather have them pissed off and wet than dead and dry
you breaking up with me roy ?
got a call from UNknown
chief 's having them put through your papers
they want you out when you hit your 15
you 'r e putting me on the beach ?
this UNknown failing UNknown are hitting hard
anybody near their 20 or carrying a risky jacket is getting the push
at least you UNknown l get a piece of your pension
there aren 't enough cops
it 's not personal
figure i owed you a face to face
it 's bullshit and you know it
it 's some suit making a judgement call
can 't you put in a good word turn it my way ?
i 'm not UNknown
play this smart vic
a couple UNknown nothing violent
no gang ties
department 's cutting its UNknown
phillips wants me out by the time i hit my 15th year
that 's crazy
i UNknown l walk out the front door on my own before i UNknown l let someone push me out the back
this is between you and me
not a word
is it sore ?
we UNknown l get him
hood needs a little reminder
you hurt us we hurt you worse
we UNknown l make sure that measure passes
we got a clock to kill first guys
let 's go

but he UNknown l live to see UNknown
my son was scared he panicked
he sees what white cops do to mexican kids
oh really ?
got a witness saw him fleeing from the bathroom
what time is it mama ?
you got some place you gotta be ?
i don 't feel so good
i wouldn 't feel too good either if i just slaughtered an innocent girl
i 'm guessing you didn 't UNknown the death photo with your UNknown
hey officer UNknown got a little job for you
anything you need detective
maybe you had a beef with him
so crazy in the cafeteria you got caught up in the rush fired some shots
i didn 't
i don 't know
because the truth rolls comfortably off my tongue
heard you were bragging about the new gun you bought
telling kids you pack it for protection
man that was just me talking
i didn 't even bring it to school
you snuck it past the metal UNknown pulled it out during the riot and shot him
man it wasn 't me
maybe a little truth will seem like a good idea then
it 's every day
he can 't know it was me that said anything
whoa whoa hey
that 's it
have a wonderful day
he 's inside already
here you go
and i 'm struggling with just one UNknown child
it 's the challenges of single UNknown
you too ?
he does what he can
my ex she doesn 't even acknowledge our child
i 'm sorry
you ever feel like that ?
i UNknown l see you around
could i call you sometime ?
sorry they told me that i should try to get to know some other parents and i 'm out of my depth
i could talk to you or to your husband
either one if you know whatever you
okay last name 's mackey
and you can call me about the kids or the school
my husband won 't be much help
what do you mean ?
course there 's a you know broker 's fee for UNknown trading but
she won 't say
come on man
i always take shane in these things
not me brother
so your dick fits better ?
i gotta get this organised
tina 20 turkey UNknown
i didn 't raise an animal
you hear me ?
who set the kill clock ?
don 't you touch him !
doing 20 in chino
chino 's where lorenzo 's pop is stretching
hood 's been under the microscope
maybe the UNknown used a proxy
make sure no blood blows back in their direction
i got a few UNknown graduates in chino
i UNknown l find out what pop 's story is
i know how much gas costs
same UNknown where your father got caught helping the black brethren distribute smokes
pissed off the UNknown UNknown
that asshole can 't even play by the rules in prison
my guess is lorenzo senior offered you up as a junior assassin
settle both scores
you grow a dick
it 's UNknown pride
dad started crying
it was him you were on the phone with last night ?
i gotta finish it or he dies
not for him
he was on the other line
dad told him too
he UNknown l do it
he UNknown l throw it all away for that asshole
tommy never saw it coming
he 's gone

i stuck him with my best pair
with your scissors ?
let 's go
put it down right now or i UNknown l shoot !
i gotta get this picture to my dad
you UNknown l take it to him ?
that 's it
give it here
got it ?
i heard those shots and hit the floor like everybody else
anyone else see that ?
don 't know
then you got three liars
three against one
i 'm used to it
we 'r e gonna need a little more than bad attitude to be convinced of your innocence
you best tell pale boy here to get out of my goddamn face
look i ain 't been playing trouble for a while now
from who ?
you don 't think they wanna put another one away ?
that sounds like motive to me
lazy ass cop
well your busted ass suck at it
hey book him for murder
this is wrong man
yeah i wouldn 't be too thankful
he just killed an innocent man
i wanted to kill their father a dozen times and i never did for their sake
los UNknown should slit his throat from ear to ear
ma 'a m
that prick should die
talk to your guy in chino
find out where those pictures go
you got two hours
got a call from a teacher at wellman
he just realised his gun was stolen out of a locked drawer
evan UNknown in any of his classes ?
UNknown and science
whatever happened to rapping a kid 's knuckles with a ruler ?
i got 50 bucks in the pool
that 's funny because i got 50 on you
i tried calling
say good night
i mean they have a schedule
mine 's always changing
these aren 't my rules
it 's the custody agreement
twelve year old
i just wanted to kiss them good night
wash it off before you see them
most cases are solved within the first 24 hours
after that the odds of solving them decrease UNknown
i 'm gonna learn a lot from you aren 't i ?
he knows when to wash his hands
so do i
blond UNknown tall hands might be cut up
ain 't seen nobody like that
yeah we know he hangs here
and we know this shop 's been hit nine times last year
twice last month
well next time you call us
we 'r e your new 911
we UNknown l make sure people don 't mess with your shop
we steer that kind of business someplace else
talking straight about keeping my place safe ?
i got a badge don 't i ?
lives over in UNknown green
consider your protection clock running
spread the word
who says you gotta look like janet reno right ?
you replaced your UNknown with lipstick and UNknown ?
well a place to put your shit you know ?
yeah well that 's a UNknown as well as probably getting you killed
lose those hoop earrings before someone UNknown your ears off
did i do something to piss you off ?
you have a job sweetheart all right ?
take it seriously
it 's just hard to catch a break with these guys
treat you like you don 't belong
yeah i know
so we have to prove them wrong
yeah we do
here you go
i 'd rather be running the streets with you
hell of a lot easier
don 't be so sure
i got my work cut out for me
tina she ain 't no danny UNknown
well who is ?
she 's raw but she 's got potential
yeah you still do
i UNknown l get tina right on it
what about ?
leave me alone
we seized the drugs UNknown it on camera and replaced it with dummy tar
but you never UNknown it into evidence
so you UNknown e been watching me for six months ?
i don 't want you to spin the story
felony theft under colour of authority
intent to distribute
you UNknown e been on the other side of this table a long time
you know how that will play out
does that seem fair to you ?
if you were arresting me we 'd be at police 1 and you 'd be parading me past UNknown
what do you want ?
i want us both to do the right thing curtis
and we never really want that guy do we ?
we want the guy that put him in the motion
the one who is really dangerous
who do you think i want curtis ?
come on man
but it 's the same as last year 's account
then why 's there a 5 000 margin ?
ms klm said she was going to make the changes
get over here
what the hell do you do around here ?
first of all thank you for giving me a chance to introduce myself to you
my name is
like poland or ukraine
you understand my question ?
yes of course
speak in english
korean UNknown em uh ?
yes yes sir
we 'r e minus 2 7
that 's a 1 47 million loss
why do you keep making me repeat the same words ?
didn 't i tell you to sell UNknown and buy over UNknown ?
that will cause three listed enterprises to collapse
but if we don 't sell our UNknown will go down
be more UNknown
there will be talks of your dismissal at the board meeting
are you threatening me ?
i 'm on your side sir
it 's about your father sir
a women with a foreign accent told me your father

you 'r e so cute
come over here
why do you ask ?
you UNknown e got good manners good looks and look well off
quite a few girls would go after you
meaning that i look like a gigolo right ?
i wasn 't aware of it at first
but you look like you UNknown e got many girlfriends
to be honest i thought your generosity might have UNknown from the wrong idea about me
i 'm not rich you know
i withdrew all my savings to come here
so i guess we have no business together anymore
how sad i was hoping to hit the jackpot this time
are you always so gullible ?
it 's not good to believe everything you hear
it 's not good to UNknown everything you hear

i apologize for yesterday
but it wasn 't on purpose
i hope you understand

the UNknown voyage by UNknown UNknown 1925
one summer morning in a small country town
a poor and shy young man was going to work in a bank
UNknown a work mate
you will marry the man you love !
you will marry the woman you love !
a most beautiful future !
i don 't love albert
my dear jean it 's you i love here is your engagement ring
hundreds years ago a magician stole my powers away
only a young man 's kiss could restore them
follow me you shall be rewarded !
we are in the UNknown for old fairies
nowadays nobody believes in fairies anymore
so my old sisters shut themselves up in this UNknown
they want you to kiss them all !
resign yourself !
watch out she is really evil !
these are your old friends puss in boots
be happy the fairies will give you immortality
you 'r e going to live with us forever !
i don 't want to live forever if lucie is not with me !
since you can 't stay without her we shall bring her here !
look your UNknown e !
i wanted your friends to be here also !
a fascinating life begins
the evil UNknown is jealous of lucie
i fear her power
with this ring you must only express a wish and it will come true !
if i accept to grant you the girl you must solemnly promise something that will ensure her happiness !
repeat with all my heart i want to be like a faithful dog for lucie
a dog !!
suddenly he turned into a dog !
but where is jean ?
no dogs UNknown
for the thief the ring has lost its magic power
don 't wait for jean
this damned ring has turned him into a dog !
he 's in your hands !
jean is it you ?
look how he has changed

and a shirt with a buttonhole where there ain 't supposed to be one
what 's the word on the blood ?
we 'r e still typing it
so UNknown who 's your friend ?
she 's our only witness
you interrogate her huh ?
you have the right to an attorney if you cannot afford an attorney
UNknown will finance your attorney
reporter alarmed by the recent trend and views it as greatly exaggerated in the local media
the suspect remains at large leading to increased speculation about the identity of the mysterious assailant
police continue to refuse to comment about the motive for the brutal slaying saying only that detectives view it as an isolated incident
reporters ask questions
who 's there ?
you know the 12 and change that i thought oughta be more ?
okay it 's better
better that you finally found out
found out ?
the money that you stole from me
how long have we known each other jimbo ?
a long time henry
that shiny new car of yours ?
i bought it for you didn 't i ?
something 's broken
right where it says UNknown agent ?
what are you nuts ?

i swear to god i UNknown l give you
i UNknown l give you every penny back henry

no no no !

the only bit of decent investment advice you ever gave me if i ever get UNknown enough to shoot someone the last person i 'm gonna shoot is me
best money i ever spent
the man had gone to market to buy a diamond ring
the man who never noticed that he was not a king
he choose the brightest sparkle a diamond made of glass
the setting bright and gold was UNknown out of brass
the man spent all his money the jeweler was a cheat
he told the man that UNknown wore diamonds on their feet
the man went proudly walking inside his shoe the ring
and no one ever told him that he was not a king
so you saw the guy but you can 't describe him
you want me to write that down ?
am i a suspect here ?
fine if i 'm a suspect i 'd like to consult a lawyer before i answer any more
did the i hear the l word ?
relax mr UNknown
i brought extra
i didn 't have to come down here with him did i ?
no sir you did not
so why did you ?
just wait here we UNknown l get you a lift home
you 'r e still not hard
i 'm ready

the woman who died ?
the police think i might have killed her
i didn 't
jesus who ?

i 'm becoming a pretty good second story guy
i got in the back window
i had to
i can 't let you go out there
henry i 'm sorry
you sound guilty
because i was part of it
how long ?
we get so used to the lies and deceit
it makes you do things that you don 't want to do
i tried to tell you
i was so sure you thought it was me
i couldn 't imagine
that it was henry ?
henry what 's his name ?
that mouse ?
trying to make it look like this ?
who would want to live like this except a glutton like milo ?
why don 't you just kick it over ?
get out ?
i am trying
in your head it 's not
but out here where your feet touch the ground it is
as simple as murder ?
what 's in your head henry ?
i can 't forgive it and i can 't forget it
but i can understand it
i know what it 's like to feel so betrayed
what you don 't understand is that if you let them betray you you 'r e betraying yourself
i UNknown e done it my whole life
and it 's what you UNknown l be doing if you stay with that creep
what else do i have ?
look at me
a beautiful woman
we should have spoken
you were saying that if it weren 't for that debt maybe you and
is that the larry case show ?
am i on air ?
i 'm phoning about UNknown
i know who he is
me henry UNknown
but i killed her anyway
i dropped her body off the 9th street pier
henry stop it !
he 's in the river same place
he UNknown l be the one in the fancy new car
the police are also talking to a guy named UNknown
he had nothing to do with any of this
he 's a good guy
and there 's another good guy
and she won 't have anything to do with whatever happens later tonight
i 'm cutting you loose rosie
pack us in a cattle car and take us down to the ghetto
come on down !

you are just like before
don 't be noisy
UNknown UNknown is working as a coachman in order to support his poor family
UNknown that brilliant boy at our primary school ?
he used to say that he would become a doctor of agriculture
i am ashamed to see you like this
you are self employed
taro 's home is the finest in the village
you are grown up
night from every home comes light of comfort and pleasure
UNknown 's father who is a rich farmer UNknown
UNknown 's mother UNknown
UNknown 's mother UNknown who has a kind heart
his sister UNknown is a gentle girl
the school teacher also wanted him to study further
UNknown was ashamed of himself because his school friends came back from tokyo
my brother could be at the top position if he went to high school
father i would like to go to tokyo
i will study hard and return as a great man
i know what you think
but we have no money for it
i will have a job while i am studying in tokyo
no you cannot succeed in anything if you do not concentrate on one thing
i 'm sure that you will be able to study further sooner or later
so please be patient and work for us
morning everybody wakes up in order to do their daily work
this is for you
he was a brilliant pupil at the primary school
their alma mater
the graduates of this school are invited to attend

my daughter has gone on that train
she has abandoned me and gone to the city
mother thank you for everything
but i am fed up with the country life
i am going to live in tokyo
i wonder if she UNknown l come back
you can ask to the police for her protection
her daughter has gone to tokyo

sir actually i have to go to a buddhist ceremony for my family
finally i have gotten away from that boring meeting
a week later
UNknown why did you organize such a club ?
i am doing this because i would like to let my village friends know city life
the country life is simplicity
no not only the country life
a man like you who 's only graduated from a primary school does not understands our taste
no our teacher taught us that a man 's character is more precious than learning
everybody does not act like that
we have many things to do
more than music more than dance you have greater enterprise to study
it is agriculture
what is japan coming to ?

what is our land coming to ?
what is japan coming to ?
sir i decided to remain in this village and become a good farmer

i will decline the offer
i pay my respects to your heart

where can i find his most esteemed highness
mr baron von UNknown ?
baron UNknown von UNknown of UNknown decent yet UNknown
a letter ?
someone shall give the messenger a drink !
we would like to inform his grace in all confidence about a worthwhile party
the girl is a true angel and has just left the convent and she is the sole heiress of the rich army UNknown
mr von UNknown
we salute your highness
early tomorrow i must go to vienna
if she only knew what she means to me ?
she is the UNknown of all the love in the world
and does he know what he means to me ?
youth which i have lost a little sunshine that everyone needs
tell me about your life
like all young girls i dreamt that one day a prince would ride to the castle to take me away while i was still at the convent
prince UNknown has done us the honour to ask for your hand
he is a great military leader who has twice defeated the prussian king in battle
and so i was promised to a man which i hardly knew who saw me only once or twice and on the day of our wedding
i lay at your feet all that i own
my house and my servants are at your service
i have the order to immediately go to war with the imperial army
and so i was left alone without hope of luck until you came in through the window and stole my heart
after a long nights journey the baron approaches vienna
my room shall be immediately prepared !
i must attend upon my cousin
i am prepared to exchange my UNknown title and blue blood against the common wealth of her father
only one thing is worse than a scheming woman
a scheming man
open the UNknown if you would like to see the princess lover !
my beauty have you ever dined with a man of noble heritage ?
UNknown get over here !
go immediately to the UNknown palace and inform count UNknown that he is expected here tomorrow morning
i have decided that count UNknown shall be her knight of the rose !
if you are free tonight my darling then send a note to the tavern the white steed
the high UNknown named by her UNknown majesty
queen maria theresa watches over morals and virtue
since when does a chambermaid wear a UNknown 's cuff ?
only a man kisses like that
the high UNknown appointed by her majesty the queen UNknown you with UNknown to most carefully continue to investigate

he can then finally return to vienna to the woman he loves
the army may only rest for two days not longer
mail has arrived from vienna your grace
even the simplest soldier receives mail from a UNknown hand yet not a line for him from the princess
the UNknown is to report immediately !
sound the alarm !
who is that beautiful young lady ?
it is the daughter of a rich newly made nobleman
why doesn 't the pretty girl want to take part in our game ?
her nobility is too young she has to wait a little while at least one or two hundred years
would the young lady want to play with us ?
a kiss ! a kiss !
have you introduced yourself to cousin UNknown as the knight of the rose as i have asked you ?
tomorrow my cousin i will allow myself to present a silver rose to miss UNknown !
who was this girl ?
it was sophie the daughter of mr von UNknown your princely grace
the day on which the silver rose is handed over has finally arrived
the house of mr UNknown is full of excitement
according to etiquette the father of the bride has to be out of the house when the knight with the silver rose approaches
precisely eleven minutes after the knight of the rose enters the father must return to present the bride to the groom
the great moment
i thought he would be an old man
like st nicholas
one hundred thousand !
but baron that would ruin me !
let 's make a compromise
let 's say eighty thousand !
no at least one hundred thousand !
a true lady brings almost as much dowry !
this monster wants to marry you ?
no never even if his blood is UNknown than the sky and his title older than UNknown !
allow me to tell him that you will not marry him because i adore you and you love me
i would like to hide at your place and not care what everybody says
the young lady does not want you she cannot love you and refuses to become your wife
what a mouth on this young man !
didn 't you get it ?
the young lady will not marry you !
don 't be alarmed my darling trust me and all will be alright !
when everybody was asleep
there exists a well founded suspicion that a man was in the room of mrs marshall the wife of your highness
we see it as our duty
your excellency the enemy is surrounded !
we will be victorious if we attack as soon as possible
i am just in the right mood we will attack !
today or tomorrow
i gave the baron my word !
the marriage certificate is signed and he already received an installment
you don 't really believe i hope that the count will ask for your hand ?
he 's just playing with you and he UNknown l turn his back on you !
but if you would marry mr von UNknown
well you would become a baroness right away !

the father had an angel of a daughter and he chose a bridegroom for her a dumb fatso

even though an authentic aristocrat wants to marry your daughter you father ass would much rather give her to this animal
my son in law will be baron UNknown

you child playing with the captured arctic fox
you UNknown the reindeer
and you sitting in the audience
you knee deep in grain
knee deep in water
you spinning your wool in the mountains
you all are the masters of the soviet

to the UNknown mountains
to the UNknown on the cliffs of the arctic ocean
to the owls of the north
to the UNknown of the black sea
all are in your hands

where caviar is UNknown
where over a distance of thousands of UNknown
one does not meet a single person

good morning editor

they found a notebook on him
i 'm one of those persons on the list
i UNknown l have a bunch of flowers
if not hang up
it 's no use
i UNknown e got something special
no it can 't
UNknown i UNknown e finished with the work by night
particularly with you
i 'm going to UNknown now
which one ?
a guy who is in this notebook has called me
he claims he used to UNknown money for the mafia
but why does he want to spill the beans ?
he called me from a phone box at the station
he wants to meet me tomorrow
are you going ?
well i wanted to ask for your opinion
i couldn 't wait till tomorrow
if you want my opinion give the case to UNknown
to UNknown ?
in the end some ukrainian will blow your brain out
then why do you care more about me than about your boyfriend ?
because i think UNknown will do it better
i don 't know what you are up to ?
can this be regarded as UNknown ?
it 's no use
i simply had to leave
i was at UNknown 's place
we talked about her moving out
when you UNknown e heard this news call me
i don 't quite know what 's up
any affairs ?
with the boss ?
i want to return to madman 's affair
we UNknown e got a new UNknown
UNknown wants me to give it to you
does UNknown assign UNknown ?
don 't make me regret
i can 't
i 'm leaving tomorrow morning
damn your UNknown !
no at eleven
i 'm sending it right away
and where 's UNknown ?
i don 't know
four little negroes went to the woods
one was eaten up by the wolves
only three were left three little negroes were digging a hole one was buried in the sand
only two were left
it 's a long time since i slept so well
then i envy you
don 't let me disturb you
i UNknown l be at eleven
i 'm just leaving
just go because i want to finish
you could have done this yesterday
you were here at the time
cognac is over there
i thought i was about to be sent to prison
i went to check and then the hag tells me i have some UNknown
the bookkeeper made a mistake and i thought i got a fucking sentence
he 's coming back from vienna today
can i ?
some people believe there is a limit on the number of breaths you perform
and then you die
you have nowhere to hurry you 'r e about to die unless
you wake up
we UNknown l meet at nine at holiday inn
i 'm now at the central station
i still have something to settle
have you noticed what a choice of ribbons you get at the florist 's these days ?
interesting isn 't it ?
are you a UNknown ?
no an UNknown of ribbons ?
but we can talk before this lady comes
how do you know this is a woman ?
do you see how UNknown the shop girl wraps up the flowers UNknown them on UNknown
everything has its sequence and order
like in life
i missed the plane yesterday
i was supposed to fly to vienna
i live in the woods near warsaw
i couldn 't see any fog in the morning
off i go to the airport and it 's milk there i rush to the check in and it 's the dead end
there was nothing to fight for
the plane was about to take off
then i remembered there is another flight from UNknown
i left my car in the parking lot and managed to catch the train
if i hadn 't been in time for the negotiations 30 thousand mattresses would be now filling my stores
quite a lot
they showed me an approved letter of credit and didn 't even bargain for the price
destined for the UNknown island in the pacific sir
and how did you manage to communicate with those UNknown ?
the island is UNknown for the time being
some french concern is building a tourist base for UNknown
i had such pressing debts that i switched over to mattresses
that was for nothing as they didn 't take the article
what 's the difference ?
and yet it is a difference
i did know
it measured up to two metres
we stretched it by six UNknown and for nothing
UNknown as well sit and shoot myself
at least you had a choice to shoot yourself or not
are you joking ?
i didn 't dare to tell my wife
i sold a few mattresses to the guy who bought the flat then a customer from vienna turned up
they 'r e organizing help for africa
in the morning i signed the bloody contract and i was saved
then perhaps you might help me ?
why not ?
no no i was joking
i 'm waiting for somebody
but he won 't turn up i think
have you got children ?
i have a son
a gifted little stinker !
fancy my wife giving birth to such a child
it 's a miracle
suppose your son won 't be interested in mattresses
what then ?
you 'r e right
that dark spot here
yesterday the doctor gave me the results of a check up and he spoiled everything
dum UNknown UNknown
you said you live outside the town
can i ask a favour of you ?
i 'm listening
that UNknown l be the number of days i 'm going to live
i don 't eat such nasty stuff
thanks for the lift
have got money for the ticket
buzz off !
and what 's the matter with you ?
excuse me sisters this sister got lost and she can 't find her convent
good morning editor
do you remember the madman 's affair ?
they found a notebook on him
i am one of those persons on the list
i needed money
you understand i can 't tell you anything more now
i UNknown e heard your interviews on the radio
i thought you were human
i UNknown l be waiting for you tomorrow at the bar in the lobby of the central station
i UNknown l be holding a bunch of flowers
i 'm getting away from it all
don 't look for me please
i don 't care i will not pay
number fifty one and fifty three
mind you this famous pianist is sitting beside me in the compartment
the one who left during the solidarity period
remind me her name will you
oh fuck it !
they called my mother and told her they were going to send me in pieces in a parcel
she almost suffered a heart attack
so what ?
in poland today only the church is the UNknown of true values
and you my child had a vocation for taking the habit ?
no chance for a job after school
my parents have a farm so they manage somehow
she was twenty five and a spinster
the owner of a UNknown was courting her and my parents spent a lot on her dowry to encourage UNknown
my mother said that a convent was better than UNknown
and there was nothing else for me to do
that 's right
you had been one of the best pupils but before graduation you broke down and failed to get your certificate
then your mother took you to the convent
this was my debut at the theatre kid
i don 't understand how one can lie so UNknown ?
and a habit isn 't a rag to play with
what are you saying ?
change your seat chris
here you are kid
what do you mean ?
i had a call from a guy who was involved in madman 's affair
he wants to spill the beans
drop in for a chat
UNknown are you there ?
yes boss but i thought i was off today
i UNknown e got an assignment from the bbc
i can 't now
some chicks again ?
what an UNknown !
i got off at the central station
you 'r e crazy
a cat ?
in which convent do they wear such habits ?
you won 't really believe
i won 't believe
she 's some UNknown liar
i was telling you that she gets inside when i am not home and noses around
i even talked with her father
don 't just stand there !
put on your clothes and get lost !
it 's all my fault because i love him
he plays fine
it 's not what you fancied ?
go back to your daddy then
you 'r e crying ?
did he thrash you ?
no he wanted to kiss me
and then ?
that 's not true
UNknown has started going bold
but tomorrow we UNknown l return the habit ?
go to sleep
you remember our mum 's saying that you UNknown e got to keep a tight rein on a bloke
and you ?
what 's wrong with him ?
so you UNknown e come
some guy arranged to meet me at eight in the bar at the central station
are you going ?
he arranged to meet you
it seems you 'r e UNknown me at risk ?
that 's what i have you for
how shall i recognize him ?
he UNknown l be holding a bunch of flowers
will you have a game of tennis with me tomorrow ?
we UNknown l talk later
listen but i
UNknown tennis courts at nine
yesterday UNknown was in a bad shape
take care of her
did you talk to UNknown ?
he gave me a big material
perhaps i 'm in luck at last
UNknown has got a cancer
you 'r e joking ?
UNknown miracles do happen don 't they ?
a beer ?
and you ?
of what ?
what then ?
and why should you live ?
is there anyone who cares about you ?
perhaps the caretaker 's daughter
how much time do i have left ?
what 's going on ?
and where will you do him in ?
at the central station
i won 't ever be
yes as long as it is brief
the tram then UNknown and he wasn 't able to catch her
but it isn 't your fault that the angel wasn 't attentive enough
oh UNknown how can you be so naive ? napisy pobrane z http napisy org nowa wizja UNknown w
there is nothing better than UNknown prospect at least not in petersburg
UNknown UNknown UNknown a clerk of whom it cannot be said that he was very remarkable

cheats are part of it too !
the young clerk chasing the girl was so far a person of no consequence and yet rather impetuous

UNknown petrovich UNknown a landowner coming to petersburg to burke one old matter

UNknown s flat was on the third story one little room without any UNknown to style
UNknown major UNknown UNknown UNknown
heavenly creature UNknown major
as a man of education would you give us a co operation so to say ?
the thing is not tricky where it is written UNknown work a bit with a knife and a pen and you il get UNknown instead of UNknown
he is not a general but is equal to one
he s got such an education and excellent deeds
a lot of drafts and white paper were UNknown in a certain department
the person of no consequence came by the rooms again
your case is rotten
send for UNknown and as he comes UNknown him and UNknown him well
then keep after him about the case
dreaming of a heavenly creature

that foe is frost

well three fifty UNknown notes or more
i have already had some my good woman
overcoat s capital
UNknown tea 2 05 ; UNknown the UNknown off duty
for his long service our UNknown UNknown got a UNknown of 60 rubles a buckle in a button hole and a UNknown in his bottom
the most solemn day in the life of UNknown UNknown
new overcoat !
it s not a new overcoat it s just er an old coat
all right i invite you all to tea instead of UNknown UNknown
as luck would have it it is my name day
the clerk who had invited him to tea lived a long distance from UNknown UNknown
soon UNknown UNknown felt that he was one too many in this company
brother they they stole my new overcoat
brother who should i address ?
it is known that the person of consequence used to be a person of no consequence
but which merits made of him a person of consequence is not known
a clerk is waiting for you in the UNknown
a clerk is waiting for you over there shall i call him ?
your excellency i came to ask you
what next dear sir !
don t you know how to proceed ?
you should have addressed the secretary first
secretaries your excellency are people er you can t depend on
how dare you young man ? !
in an instant it had blown a UNknown into his throat
you had better lose no time my good woman order him now a deal coffin an oak one will be too dear for him
UNknown each stranger than the one before were haunting him
under thls reference number it is reported that a UNknown counselor
UNknown UNknown UNknown is UNknown from the records by reason of death
he 'd not discovered a continent or won a war
he was not a great general a great statesman or a great scientist
yet even now more than 60 years later the legends which surround him are as vivid as they were then
his name was william frederick cody
but to young and old rich and poor king and commoner he is known as buffalo bill
this is the story of his life
hup you !
hup hup !
good morning folks
yes i guess so
ain 't another rifle in the world with a bark like that springfield
miss UNknown l want you to meet up with buffalo bill cody the best scout the best shot the best man on the plains
how do you do
my daughter and i are grateful sir
you UNknown e saved our lives
anyone would be lucky for the chance
not everyone would UNknown e acted so UNknown
she 's right mr cody
we need more men like you to exterminate these savages
they must be wiped out root and branch
there are some white men that need wiping out
i don 't understand you sir
this is not a war arrow it 's a hunting arrow
are you implying that we were fair game ?
i mean those were agency lndians crazy drunk on white man 's whiskey
i suppose that excuses them out here
the red man and whiskey don 't mix ma 'a m
senator you and mr UNknown can double up on fanny
miss UNknown you take UNknown
lf she cause you trouble cuss her out and kick her
i UNknown l climb up with bill
i 'm afraid i 'm not exactly dressed for kicking and UNknown
perhaps it would be better if i went with mr cody
i guess you 'r e right miss
prepare to mount
i hope it 's not too much for your horse
somebody wrote you a letter
who would be writing to you ?
the mail is delivered according to rank and there 's plenty UNknown than you
do i have to wait for every UNknown in the outfit ?
you UNknown l wait for every UNknown and every buck trooper too
a civilian don 't rate
bye bye bill
we have a number of unexpected guests you must meet
maybe i 'd better not stay
i 'm not dressed for this sort of a UNknown
nonsense ln these UNknown you 'r e the handsomest man in the room
by the lord harry
gentlemen mr cody
mr cody sir
will you honor me by taking wine ?
i am a man of pronounced temperance principles
founder of the national association of modern UNknown
but there are moments when principle must yield to the importance of occasion
your good health sir
what do you think of the west ?
the most amazing source of inspiration i UNknown e encountered miss louisa
the wilderness the peak the unending UNknown where UNknown the lndian in all his UNknown in all his nobility
after seeing his UNknown i 'm skeptical about his nobility
lndians are good people if left alone
nothing would suit me better than to leave them alone
you UNknown l never live that one down general
i hope you UNknown l enjoy it
it 's a trifle
do you mind ?
who are you ?
i didn 't come here to steal
maybe you lndians have another word for it but that 's my dress you have
i tell you i didn 't come here to steal
perhaps you UNknown l explain to me just what you 'r e doing in my clothes
i wanted to find out something
and just what may i ask ?
i wanted to find out if i could be as beautiful as a white girl in a white girl 's way
please i 'd rather you kept it
it was so becoming to you
i don 't believe you !
you don 't want it because an lndian wore it !
why can 't you build your railroad around the cheyenne land instead of across it ?
young man that would delay construction for over a year and double the cost
think we can get him to listen to reason ?
i doubt it
how yellow hand
i understand your words
we UNknown e hunted and fished together since we were so high
once you saved yellow hand 's life
when you do an lndian a favor he never forgets it
lf you do him bad he never forgets that either
they give themselves amazing names
tell us why your people refuse to obey the order to move
we must live where there is food and water and buffalo
what has the buffalo got to do with it ?
without the buffalo the lndian would perish
it 's his main source of food
ln the winter the hides protect them from freezing
what do you mean ?
yellow hand is a prince the son of a king
UNknown men like that to washington
try and understand them
savages loose in the east ?
the idea is preposterous
lf they won 't talk sense here in their own back yard what can you expect 3000 miles away ?
yellow hand do you want us to use force ?
my people do not want war
but we will fight if we must
general are you prepared to act ?
yes i have my orders
all right yellow hand you UNknown e had your last warning
move or be driven out
ls the white man finished ?
here 's to something new
you wouldn 't talk like that if you ever saw the cheyenne on the warpath
there 's nothing to be alarmed at
i UNknown l clean them out in a week
the tribes gathered and rode to war a thousand strong
they struck settlements and UNknown like a whirlwind of destruction killing burning spreading terror through the countryside
general there 's a cheyenne war party about 500 braves heading this way
where 'd you make contact ?
about 20 miles from here
on the smoky
tell him there is an old man here at the agency great in the council of the whites
you understand ?
three days rations and UNknown
120 rounds per man
very good sir
certainly i am
the cheyenne are a UNknown lot
i UNknown l attend to the strategy cody
and my strategy is the attack now and any other time
it 's UNknown
maybe you 'r e not missing anything by being left behind
i guess not
lf they do it won 't be where he 's looking for it
you know the lndian cody don 't you ?
nobody knows the lndian
pony express stage driving scouting
lndians never do what you expect
where are you going ?
to the agency
those savages took my father
they UNknown l torture him to death
your noble friends !
how many were there ?
i don 't know
there are too many of them
we must do something !
all we can do is hope for the best
they only wanted the senator as a hostage
to get better peace terms
your squaws can 't make me run
get down from your horse and see if you can
don 't be afraid
i came in peace
they 'r e squaws
thanks yellow hand
lf the white men will hear the word of my father let them come to powwow at council grove
lf they will not hear his word let them come armed for war
my father has spoken
then go UNknown
the white man is a hostage
speaklng ln cheyenne
tell your father his price was paid when i saved your life
a debt is a debt yellow hand
speaklng ln cheyenne
the white man will return with you
thanks yellow hand
now there is no debt and no friendship between us
lf we meet in battle there is a brave of the cheyenne that will take the scalp of UNknown and hang it to his lodge pole
it may be easier to hang it than to take it yellow hand
he 's worn out
maybe there is miss louisa
me and powder face would like to show you some of our country
i would love you to
we 'd like you to know what there is about it that gets under a man 's skin
i 'd like to
do you agree ?
now that the fighting 's over what UNknown l you be writing about next ?
i was thinking of turning my pen to the realm of romance
a novel about the west founded on my own adventures
i 'd sure like to read that
you know i was even considering including some of your exploits but no you 'd never do for a hero of romantic fiction
guess you 'r e right about that
you look like a hero act like a hero you even rescue the heroine but you don 't marry her
well i 'm going to
i sure do
no not yet
any horse would be ma 'a m
you 'r e light to carry and you sit quiet
that 's what you said the first time we met
you 'r e repeating yourself bill
powder face is a horse of sound judgment ma 'a m
his sentiments are all right with me
anybody he 's fond of i 'm fond of
that 's a cheyenne courting blanket
a courting blanket ?
how does she wear it ?
like this ?
well he doesn 't even open his mouth
he just hangs around all day and makes faces like this
that sounds like a very dull courtship
lf he doesn 't speak how does he propose ?
well he plays his own call on a courting flute
she opens the left side of the blanket and takes him into it
like this bill ?
he built her a cabin in a valley not far from the fort
and they settled down to a frontier life
didn 't you get my letter ?
that 's it that 's my letter telling you i was coming
i mailed it a week before i left
that 's nothing
come to think of it he never did get it
bill would you get the senator 's bags ?
that 's changing though right away
what do you mean ?
UNknown 's starting a new industry
a tremendous affair
people will pay anything for them
UNknown 's formed a corporation
i 'm on the board myself
you bill will direct the field operations
we want all the hides you can get and more
the UNknown for buffalo robes swept the east
they brought big prices
it became the sport of the world bringing UNknown from every land and in a single month 5000 head were slaughtered
how 's the duke like buffalo hunting ?
thinks it 's the greatest
nothing like it in russia
he wants you to come over and join him in post UNknown UNknown
what 's that ?
i 'm tired
how so my UNknown UNknown ?
bill 's wondering about the large scale buffalo hunting has been assuming
it seems to be going on everywhere
this started as a business
now they 'r e shooting them for sport
there 's a limit to even the buffalo
what worries me is the grand duke UNknown the bounds of UNknown
i UNknown l carry your apologies
it 's not often you 'r e going to get to UNknown with royalty
i like my present company better
i was afraid when i brought you here but now i 'm glad
you UNknown e been happy
bill at this moment i 'm happier than i UNknown e ever been before
i am happy too and tired
nothing in the world can move me right now
suppose it was someone much more important than the grand duke
what are you doing bill ?
you lie still
pack up ?
oh bill not yet
we the cheyenne have called our brothers of the sioux
so we can hear their words about this thing
yesterday the buffalo was many as the blades of grass upon the prairie
today the buffalo is few as the leaves of the oak tree in winter
the white man has done this thing so the red man will starve
when the buffalo is gone we starve
we have no meat to eat no hides to make UNknown no robes to make beds
brothers it is not good for man to hear his woman and children crying
there are better ways to die
let both people be bound by the belts of the war chiefs
it is the belt of yellow hand war chief of the cheyenne
it is the belt of crazy horse war chief of the sioux
the sioux and the cheyenne will strike together
the sioux must strike first
but why the sioux ?
the cheyenne are ready
ln our land are few
my brother is wise in war
go to your homes
do as i say go to your homes
i 'm not taking any chances
i UNknown l get you to the doctor all right
don 't you worry sweetheart
woman speaklng ln cheyenne
she 's just old
to die ?
it 's the way of her people
there 's nothing we can do
here am i going to bring a new life into the world and leaving an old woman behind to die
that 's nature 's way louisa
when anything becomes too old it 's just pushed aside
but it shouldn 't be
that 's why we have civilization
it 's a boy
bill couldn 't we take him east ?
i want him to be safe
to have care doctors schools all the advantages of civilization
well he UNknown l have care and he won 't need any doctor
he got here without one
it would be nice to go east though
but it doesn 't matter where we are bill as long as we 'r e together
the three of us
the sioux have overrun the north beaten crook and wiped out custer
wiped out custer ?
we 'r e joining crook on the north UNknown
you 'r e the only guide here who knows that country
well cody ?
you 'r e a civilian
i can 't order you to do anything but i can leave it to your conscience
we move in two minutes cody
with or without you
but you 'r e going
the general said he couldn 't order you to
bill you can 't leave us
nothing matters so long as we 'r e together the three of us
bill i loved you
you wanted a son and i bore him for you like a squaw
but he 's mine as much as yours
lf you leave now it 's forever
i UNknown l take him back east with me to civilization
our problem is to keep the cheyenne from joining forces with the sioux
you 'r e way off
the cheyenne haven 't risen
our best move is to keep them in their country by taking war bonnet gorge
that 's miles off our path
whoever holds the gorge holds the whip hand
but it 's out of our terrain
we won 't have terrain if they join the sioux
orders are orders cody
all right sir by the quickest way
i thought the north UNknown was that way
this is a shortcut
smith fall out and tell a troop to change direction
holy smoke bill cody
clancy here 's that dollar i owe you
come on boys
i never thought i 'd see the day when i 'd be praying for the sight of his ugly mug
save your breath
sound the gallop !
that 's what they call it
i lost my way
shooting 's too good for you
there they are forming to charge
lf 16 men can 't hold them till the troops get here we 'r e UNknown thanks to you
what 's that madman doing ?
making medicine ?
save you five minutes maybe so the troops can get here
though i am dead the grass will grow the sun will shine the stream will flow
though i am dead the grass will grow the sun will shine the stream will flow
take your people back to their country !
the cheyenne have no part in this war !
the cheyenne have part in this war
white men have fallen before the sioux now they UNknown l fall before the cheyenne
let us speak fair words in council
this time it is the UNknown of the cheyenne that will speak
you said a brave of the cheyenne would hang my scalp on his lodge pole !
i don 't see him yellow hand
where is he ?
ah UNknown !
they were all friends of mine
lf there is you UNknown l get it in the order of your rank
i 'm thinking it won 't be soon what with six months of mail to be sorted
supposing i find it myself ?
lf you find it you can keep it
but you UNknown l get no delivery from me except in the proper military manner
and you know what that means
he wants me to come east
i told you you 'd get in trouble for leading them troops the wrong way
ls it to get a court martial ?
a medal you say ?
hey i was in that too
maybe there will be one for me
here it is
what 's the matter with the president addressing me as private ?
of course the man 's only been on the job a short time
ln UNknown with army regulations 248 1 2 private mcgraw having completed 20 years UNknown is hereby retired from active service in the u s army
by order of the secretary philip sheridan second lieutenant and adjutant
president 's loco calling me a private and sheridan a UNknown
how 'd the man get his job ?
what 's the date on that letter ?
april 3rd UNknown
here 's some more
for me that 's been praying for a letter for 50 years
this is what i get
ln the prime of my life
me that 's just whipped the cheyenne and could do it again with one hand going to the old soldiers home
i got more lead in my carcass than that UNknown phil sheridan has got gold UNknown
yeah who 's to blame you for that
one of these days he might be president or even an officer
he was only three days old when i left
i wonder if he UNknown l remember me
were his eyes open yet ?
i hope ned UNknown meets me in washington
kind of lonesome in a strange country
nobody in the east ever heard my name
all right chips
ned 's put you in the books
right out in front
holy mackerel it is !
hey joe mary lizzie !
buffalo bill 's out here !
there 's buffalo bill !
come on chips
come back !
buffalo bill is coming !
adventures they themselves could never have
i hated to say goodbye to poor old chips
i UNknown l have him back with me if i 'm ever fixed to do it
he 's well taken care of
the white house carriage is out in front
good my wing footed UNknown
here 's a dollar
that 's the first time any handshake of mine was ever worth a dollar
thank you sonny
i wanna see my son
you will after the president UNknown you with a congressional medal
let the new prince of the plains cut his teeth on it
what 's all that stuff ?
requests for interviews UNknown
our old friend UNknown is arranging a banquet for you in new york
yes sir !
he 's upstairs sir
from water systems
a disease of civilization
lf you 'd left him there he 'd be alive today
oh bill !
his deepest personal sympathy goes with that medal
that 's what they give you for killing lndians
lndians that can live against nature and feed and clothe themselves with nothing but their bare hands
don 't you think we ought to leave ?
and who gives it to you ?
they 'r e pot bellied civilized citizens who couldn 't walk a mile with an lndian
they give you medals
any 10 year old kid who was born and raised like an lndian could whip the daylights out of them
and if i had been one of them i have no apologies to offer and no regrets
my ambition to see civilization move westward on tracks of steel has been severely criticized by elements of the press and even on the floor of congress
on the other hand there are those better qualified to express an opinion
who believe like general sherman that the only good lndian is a dead lndian
read it slowly
i was afraid i was gonna make a fool of myself in front of you tonight
but that would be all right because a man can make himself a fool when he 's off his own stamping ground
but when a man makes a fool of himself on his own stamping ground there 's no excuse for him
i don 't hold with general sherman that a good lndian is a dead lndian
that 's why we UNknown and the lndians have had to suffer
there 's only one lndian you know or that you ever thought about
and here he is mr UNknown
the lndian on your pennies
you realize what you 'r e up against ?
do you think UNknown is gonna let you get away with a thing like this ?
you 'r e crazy
what can he do to me ?
i don 't know but it UNknown l be plenty
i don 't wanna see him tear you down
oh i UNknown l take care of myself
i 'm off to mexico
but i 'm warning you UNknown will stop at nothing
buffalo bill is all right a good hunter a good lndian scout
but to give him all the credit for our victory at war bonnet gorge well that 's going a little too far
i tell you buffalo bill 's a fraud
i was at war bonnet gorge myself
he didn 't have any more to do with killing yellow hand than i did

he 's gone
why don 't you go to him ?
that 's really what you 'd like to do
forget your pride
do you know where he is now ?
on a wooden horse
step up for a moral and educational exhibition of UNknown by the king of the plains
killer of cheyenne war chief that human tiger yellow hand !
UNknown buffalo bill !
never on the plains
because it is an unfortunate weakness of human nature to distrust a man of my profession
ladies and gentlemen you 'd think it was a trick
that is why the offer is made to you
i furnish the dollar you furnish the fingers
step right up !
anybody at all ?
the management assumes no liability
now madam if you UNknown l step back on that little platform
and there 's no reason for you to be nervous
now madam hold out the dollar
wait don 't fire
but you can 't stay here
once i made the mistake of leaving you
but i 'm a man on a wooden horse
you saw for yourself tonight
you wouldn 't be on a wooden horse if you 'd go back to the people who know you
you don 't belong in this crowded ugliness
bill let 's go west tomorrow
i UNknown l never go until i can look an lndian in the face
but you 'r e all alone
what can you do for the lndians here ?
i don 't know
don 't forget aim at the jet of water right under the ball and squeeze don 't pull
bill what are lndian kids like ?
what do they do ?
do they have to go to school ?
they go to school
no they learn to ride and fish and hunt and swim
i wish i was an lndian
tell us about it buffalo bill
well it 's kind of hard to tell about them but if you kids could see 300 of them on galloping ponies with feathers flying you 'd never forget it
three hundred lndians charging as they rode at war bonnet gorge
it 's a colossal idea and by the lord harry we UNknown l do it
love for you my boy
i know UNknown who 'd pay for that idea
what UNknown l we do with lndians in the city ?
put them in a show
the greatest show the world ever saw
lndians 300 500 1000 of them !
cowboys troopers stagecoach buffalo riding roping
lf the east won 't go to the west kiddies we UNknown l bring the west to the east !
he brought the western frontier and the indians to new york
the city folks saw for themselves the true pioneer spirit of the west
as the years passed by he UNknown the world and was UNknown by all
presidents shook his hand queens and UNknown gave him gifts and children the world over gave him their love
UNknown and cheerlng stops
but now the time has come to say not good night as on former occasions but goodbye
hand in hand my wife and i are returning to our home in the west

the case of the three UNknown
based on the three thieves by the italian writer u UNknown
UNknown and director
olga UNknown count UNknown
v UNknown the burglar
the first thief was an ordinary petty street thief
the second was a famous international thief
the third thief was also international
prices of grain rising
and every thief attended to his trade as far as possibilities would allow
the UNknown of the banker 's suburban villa
UNknown 's favorite strolling place
as a faithful son of the church
i will give my town house and all its land only to your holy community
for three UNknown cash down
let 's go holy fathers !
look over your purchase and let 's close the transaction
each letter each note that your mistress writes send over to me !
the negotiations at the banker 's house were proceeding with difficulty
i UNknown l deduct a sum from the price and give it to you personally for your poor !
tapioca 's apartment was not distinguished by its UNknown
binoculars are a valuable thing but not edible
where will i ever hide this money ?
the bank is already closed and tomorrow is sunday
let 's risk it !
there 's a fortune to be had under banker UNknown 's roof !
a good thing will always find a buyer
get the tool
finished with affairs in the city the banker set off to see his wife at the villa
towards evening tapioca set out on UNknown
there 's no work the owners are at the villa
after a rich dinner at the villa
i cannot leave such a sum in an empty house anything could happen !
but why should i go ?
well you know
to signor anatole UNknown the jockey club
to guido UNknown first regiment of UNknown
but don 't come earlier than 3
let my husband get sound to sleep
you know my husband well he 's greedy and jealous
today he sold his house and land and apparently received a full 3 million for it
how many years has it been !!
here my friend
save yourself run away !
what am i a porter or something ?
why didn 't you bring the maid ?
now now UNknown let 's not quarrel
do we have evil evil UNknown lurking about ?
you know it 's better if we both go four eyes are more reliable
it 's obvious one of the workers dropped it from the roof
the reason for my appearance madam is thls letter
my letter ?
too late for the bank so he locked the money up in the safe
he didn 't want to risk leaving the money in town when he wasn 't there but with the wife at the villa
are you a UNknown ? !
enough of this !
so what will you tell your husband about your letter ?
the refined speech and UNknown manners of the stranger had their effect
UNknown wake up
this is shocking !
get out of here idiot !
permit me to be of service my lady
the UNknown flew in once then flew away and is singing UNknown
believing it all the old fool sits at home waiting
the banker discovered the theft early in the morning
come now !
take 200 thousand return the rest and that UNknown l be the end of it
there 's no need for you to be put in prison
i didn 't steal any money !
i like doing business with clever people !
well then take three hundred !
i UNknown e been robbed !
the safe 's been robbed !
has he been caught ?
the young thug 's been caught
no way he can get away with it !
colossal theft !!!
the theft unprecedented in its audacity and neatness took place
three million ? !
tapioca had been in prison many times but only now did he begin to realize that there 's a UNknown between UNknown
wouldn 't you like to freshen up a bit ?
three million ? !
three million ? !
three million ? !
the prison doctor !
prison is really no place for people such as you
when you 'r e freed don 't forget us
yes he 's likely no fool
the city 's best lawyers were struggling for the honor of UNknown their services without payment
and only two people in the whole city were UNknown with the prisoner sincerely and UNknown
i 'd give half my life if only to have a look at him !
it was easy for the banker 's wife to fulfill her whims
this is a mistake !
it 's not you ?
it 's absolutely not you !
no to be exact it is me !
my beloved son ease the burden on your soul by confessing frankly
that evening the police finally learned where tapioca had been living
where were you hiding ?
we were looking for you everywhere
get away !
all of you !
court 's in session !
court 's in UNknown !
bring in the accused !
lord what an ugly creature !
they listened to the indictment as if it were a fascinating novel
and upon breaking and entering he stole three UNknown one hundred eighty seven thousand
no i didn 't see him properly he 's positively UNknown !
the public prosecutor 's speech was a model of judicial eloquence
what is important is not the three million what is important is the sacred principle of UNknown property !
a short announcement ladies and gentlemen !
your attention please !
the culprit who stole the money is me !
i repeat it was i who stole the money and here it is !
and you aren 't you all thieves ? !
let 's see !
fool this is real money
there in the courtroom those idiots were fighting over false bits of paper
all roads lead to rome
what is important is not the gloves what is important is the sacred principle of UNknown property !

the merry and sad tales of a maid in prague
groom vince could match with hercules in strength
which he UNknown wasted though
you 'r e going to prague tomorrow to find a job as a maid !
we have to say goodbye vince
what will i do here without you ?
on the next morning kitty bid farewell to all that was dear to her heart
don 't cry when you get used to the bustle you can come for a visit
let go or we won 't depart !
the local UNknown crackling express UNknown moved its heavy iron body just as vince 's heart moved at the sight of his beloved kitty disappearing in the distance
an hour later
prague the heart of europe
good day sir
have you seen kitty UNknown by chance ?
may the lord repay you with children !
you 'r e wasting your time my pockets are always empty !
come to UNknown square immediately in your own interest to see UNknown 's shop windows
good heavens !
why aren 't any cows grazing the UNknown ?
on that day the people hurrying through the city streets had seen many odd events before kitty UNknown was able to find the labour office
oh my !
all they ever think about is getting their UNknown under the roof
it seems i won 't find a job if you only take older women will l ?
kitty didn 't think that she would have to spend her first night in prague outdoors
my dearest mummy if you saw me now you 'd find a better bed for me
sleep was vince 's biggest weakness
ouch hush how haw gee !
don 't moo i UNknown l feed you
kitty began her first day as a maid with dignity

the next day as a faithful dog vince
helped kitty with her morning shopping
vince was a daily guest at the grocery hardly of any benefit to it though
we sell good milk not some watered down UNknown !

this place smells of UNknown and prison !
after six months the rich butcher 's new maid stirred up interest among neighbours
as well as other people
you can clean here once a month kitty our children are tidy
this is all silly !
let 's play our winter game !
meanwhile vince opened his business at a busy spot with a nice view
there was some business although the audience was quite indifferent
owing to a brilliant idea business was finally running
their rendezvous every evening were a comfort to both of them
let me tell you your fortune miss
i wil tell you the truth !
you were born on a lucky planet
a very good man loves you
he is young and handsome with a heart of gold
the young man is quite rich and noble
his intentions are sincere and he will make you happy
the fortune teller was right because one day
a sight quite common in prague
get off !
could i take you home miss ?
be sure to come !
when his day 's work was over
vince was devastated it was the first time that kitty had disappointed him
that night kitty went to sleep hoping in fortune she had never dreamt of
poor vince did not notice how his kitty had changed while he was still that old country fellow
after a few days vince tried to get his kitty back
you can 't be surprised vince
why you look like a UNknown !
i would be ashamed for you
don 't frown vince i 'm not saying i don 't like you !
one night the butcher 's counting room was broken into
and the next morning

richard UNknown who was more than generous to her provided her with elegant clothes as well as with valuable advice

vince also had the opportunity to improve his appearance so when he and kitty went to their native village
kitty did not have to feel ashamed
dear uncle i am doing quite well
i am seeing a handsome gentleman
he says he is an engineer and he takes me to the cinema and the beauty parlour
i love him very much and he loves me too
he told me he would marry me when i stand on my own feet
i see vince too but he cannot match with richard !
i work for a doctor now and richard told me to find another job
he said he would find me a job with some banker

kitty was overwhelmed

felix UNknown a relentless lady killer

a theft unheard of !
the UNknown safe of bank director UNknown has been broken into last night

vince was released from prison at the intervention of his boss
i don 't want to see you again

you cannot match with richard whom i am seeing now
shame on you !
i UNknown e given orders that i want to see uniforms not skirts !
look me in the eyes !

yet he found no trace of the burglars
until one day when he met his old classmate who was working as a waiter in a greasy spoon coffee house
you 'd be amazed at the rag tail and UNknown UNknown in our UNknown
i UNknown e got some time off now so you can go instead of me if you want
i can lend you my tail coat

the friend UNknown UNknown
at the entrance to the grand hotel
UNknown dances thls UNknown in the grand hotel
and UNknown dances in the country of her desire
dance to the sea UNknown UNknown
were any people from the mountains here ?
did you see my dance ?
what did you enjoy most ?
the friend rushes upward high into the mountains to UNknown his overwhelming experience
UNknown 's UNknown
and a joyous UNknown UNknown herself in it
just then the friend begins his lonely descent from the icy brow of the UNknown peak
in an alpine meadow
the imposing UNknown of the highest mountain rises before her
it must be beautiful there
beautiful UNknown dangerous
one 's self
and tomorrow ?
you seek gods but it 's people you must find
i suppose you came all this way just to see me not the ski race
look for me at the jumping contest !
he wants to go up there again without me
take me with you one time into your world really high up
at least up to the cottage
the sea and the stone can never be wed
winter still UNknown across his mountain
look those enormous rocks have been worn away by the gigantic force of water in nature 's eternal cycle
and all the debris left by these mighty waters they are our mountains
why is nature so beautiful to us ?
because we invest our very souls in it
you too are like nature
and that 's why i love you so much
the bustle of UNknown
have you finished UNknown the race route ?
how 's the competition looking ?
you UNknown l probably be beaten
by whom ?

UNknown goes to watch the ski jump
UNknown prepares for the his final jump
in wonderful style UNknown UNknown the winner
the young victor
i 'm not sure i can ride such a steep hill
now where would my beautiful gentle madonna like to go ?
wild and fantastic like a gothic cathedral rises from its mighty foundation
the most beautiful mountain
the route is marked
UNknown fights for the lead
UNknown pursuing UNknown
the two favorites find themselves far behind
don 't give up we 'r e nearly the last !
racing through the forest they no longer notice the fairy tale beauty of the snow covered UNknown
pushing for the lead
just before the finish
UNknown UNknown !
may i have my wish now ?
and what does the victor desire ?
the dreadful north face
a new dance a hymn of joy
i really think she loves me
well finally you appear !
come with me i need you
we must scale the santo north face
come with me
i UNknown l come get you
i must go away with a friend of mine
a magnificent man whom you should meet sometime
the ski UNknown go to the cottage to celebrate the day 's events
UNknown has come over you ?
to the north face of the mountain
before the dreadful santo north face
are you afraid to come with me ?
look we should turn back
the f UNknown wind is coming down
let it come the stronger the better !
and let storm and avalanche roar their wild songs with it
the very walls come alive with the flow of the UNknown
it comes boiling up from the valleys in a terrible tempest
snap out of it !
do you hear me ?
you really are mad !
take me back down again !
is there something you desire down there among the rabble ?
i can 't fasten you to anything !
it 's all ice !
UNknown i 'd never do anything to harm you !
i UNknown e gone with UNknown to conquer the santo north face
i can dance no more !
you cannot just walk out in the middle of a performance
our ski master and his friend UNknown have not returned from the santo north face
are there UNknown among you ?
men who would climb up through this night up to UNknown cottage to alert the UNknown ?
who among you will climb ?
for my sake ?
they 'r e all children
i am climbing up to the cottage
i will find the way
but no single man has the strength to lift a body from an UNknown
sacrificing the comrade perhaps one 's self with him the greatest dilemma of the mountains
nature unleashed !
at least save yourself !
why why ?
first down to the forest then over the bridge and up again
have you found the bridge ?
dawn breaks upon his tormented soul
a peaceful calm settles upon the frozen world and upon the UNknown of UNknown who at last learns the fate of her beloved
among us the greatest attribute is loyalty
peace lies upon the eternal sea silently it spreads rolling out in broad waves to soothe the world 's suffering and strife
above it all UNknown a holy mountain a symbol of the greatest values than humanity can embrace fidelity truth loyalty UNknown

you all know me antonio UNknown and my gypsy circus
and now the sensation of UNknown !
the wonder of wonders !
alonzo the UNknown !
UNknown the UNknown
alonzo all my life men have tried to put their beastly hands on me to paw over me
i have grown so that i shrink with fear when any man even touches me
you are wise UNknown
and remember i am always near you ready to help you
if it takes ten million years UNknown i will keep saying 'i love you until you believe me
no one will get her no one but me !
see UNknown !
why do you always draw away from me ?
why isn 't he different from other men !
why doesn 't he keep his hands of me ?
forgive me alonzo i did not mean you
you are the one man i can come to without fear
she is with alonzo again !
are you afraid to deal with him ?
putting crazy ideas in her head again !
i UNknown l settle this !
a thousand thanks UNknown
you have UNknown in your heart haven 't you ?
in my heart in my soul in my blood !
you are fortunate
go take her in your arms and let her listen to the song of your blood
no one but me !
there is a time for fear UNknown and a time for hate and a time for love
you worry alonzo that sometime will find out you have arms ?
what would the police give to know i have hands and who i am ?
there they are UNknown and UNknown may be another to find how i have them
i have been waiting for you to teach you that my orders are law !
stop them !
the same hands that strangled UNknown committed the robberies in other towns where this circus played !
they 'r e UNknown in this troupe !
get your finger prints taken !
what will happen alonzo if they sell the circus to pay my father 's debts ?
do not worry UNknown i promised your father i would always take care of you
the circus has gone every caravan
why did we not travel with them alonzo ?
because i want to take you away from the things you hate UNknown
i could not go away without telling you again that i will love you always
i am so sorry UNknown put his hand on you again so sorry
UNknown did you see her ?
she kissed me !
she will feel that you have arms !
UNknown will never tell !
there is nothing i will not do to own her !
nothing do you understand ?
you shrink from me yet you kiss my flowers when i am gone
then if you do care for me why won 't you ever let me hold you in my arms ?
i know now what you fear
some day that fear will die
you will find me near you always waiting loving hoping
UNknown i UNknown e got to have her !
she has got to marry me !
no alonzo !
no UNknown she would never hate me she would forgive me
but you forget she saw her father strangled by a hand with two thumbs
you are forgetting that you have arms !
no no alonzo !
remember UNknown 20 years ago !
why this letter and who are you ?
you 'r e here to UNknown me !
it 's money you want !
well what is the price of your silence about my past ?
and be careful that i do not die in this operation because i left a letter telling who you are
i am afraid any more UNknown
all my foolish fears are gone
you 'r e recovering rapidly
you UNknown l be able to leave in a few weeks
but we must wait until alonzo returns
i want him with us at our wedding
perhaps the landlady knows where she is
go ask UNknown
the landlady says she is at that theatre on the plaza
you are thinner alonzo !
have you been sick ?
no not sick but i have lost some flesh
how is UNknown ?
no UNknown not best
alonzo now we can be married
i am not any more
i love them now
i did what you told me alonzo
i took her in my arms
i 'm all right now
it was just something in here that stung like the lash of a whip
they said you were rehearsing
is this your rigging !
you see when the horses are UNknown he could not let go if he wanted to
it 's very dangerous
if that happens the horses would tear my arms from my body
do not say that !
you make alonzo worry that something will happen to you
do not worry alonzo
i couldn 't reach UNknown 's robe
will you get it for me ?
so for alonzo there was an end hate called death and for UNknown an end to hate called love
UNknown if i live ten million years
i UNknown l always say 'i love you

it was time for him to lead his army into battle
a battle with a mighty enemy
resolved to win with the power of their god the christian soldiers were leaving their beloved hometown
UNknown and UNknown were seeing them off with heavy hearts
the wind in the trees was singing a sad farewell song
the men were leaving with the grim resolution that this could be their last battle

i pray for your victory
i pray for your victory
i pray for your victory

but UNknown didn 't turn a hair

UNknown was whispering to her son
my dear son
it 's a pity but the law is the law
move to the next target
shoot the boy
stop right there !
please let me do my job
UNknown 's eyes UNknown with cruelty
the lifeless body UNknown on the ground and the weeping child clinging to it could break anyone 's heart
look at that c UNknown !
it seems to me that your work here is done
you are free to go
i still have some unfinished work
some important work
this is my right and my duty
i must punish them no matter what
be quiet !
history is full of examples
master look !
can 't you see my face ?
then this is my son
i 'm your father
years later peace had returned to this castle town
but under the surface conspiracy UNknown as the shogunate UNknown relentless hate for UNknown the leader of the rebellious christians
the shogunate has issued an order for his elimination
even his old war comrades have joined the conspiracy for UNknown 's assassination
searching relief from his long lasting lung disease
UNknown had retreated to a famous temple
he had no idea that the peaceful quiet of the temple was a cover for skillful assassins
t UNknown is the day
the temple was so quiet that even a dropping leaf would make a sound
his instincts told him that evil was lurking in the shadows
however UNknown was not afraid
he was straining to hear even the slightest sound but this didn 't break his step
a shadow fell across his pale face but he kept walking without fear
the assassins were all skilled and efficient
h e 's here !
h e 's here
not a single sound in the temple hall
all was quiet
they were sneaking up behind UNknown who sat solemn and UNknown like a rock
you 'r e going to slaughter me iike a beast
but i only fought for my god
shut up traitor !
UNknown was in a UNknown position
but his anger was formidable
it gave him strength to stand against the assassins
the air froze with their cold rage
the serene temple was about to see horrible bloodshed
UNknown UNknown UNknown !
you heretic !
prepare to die !
whose side was god on ?
exhausted and coughing up blood UNknown never dropped his sword
the blood was getting in his eyes
the pain was fierce
UNknown go to hell !
you 'r e a dead man !
your soul is rotten
scum iike you cannot kill me
shut up !
one by one the assassins crept toward our wounded hero
h e just won 't give up !
go to hell !
you scum !
come on kill me !
you traitor !
UNknown was desperately fighting back
yet eventually his last bit of strength left him
his old retainer UNknown and his son UNknown
in a sign of acceptance of his fate
UNknown quietly dropped his head
UNknown was shaking with sobs
before long the shogun 's police closed on the temple
they had to capture the traitor UNknown UNknown
they were approaching slowly in great numbers
their cries pierced the dead air that lay upon UNknown
they are coming
i won 't let them take him !
don 't !
stop it !
just then the UNknown figure of justice UNknown appeared
he was leading the police UNknown who rushed to capture UNknown
master UNknown please have mercy
have mercy for your fellow samurai
you know well that my job has no room for mercy
get out of my way
the capture of that criminal UNknown UNknown is my right and my obligation
arrest him !
driven by the pride of a man who stood a final sacrifice to his celestial mission
UNknown bravely left the temple
left behind UNknown and UNknown were sobbing
f UNknown !
clad in a blood stained robe his shaking figure was a tragic sight
the cold wind of hatred and betrayal UNknown pierced his heart
righteous people and villains alike are crushed by the great power of the law
this is the way this cold world is
only god can bestow peace upon one 's soul
f UNknown father !
UNknown was resigned to his fate and was ready to meet his end
father father !
UNknown why are you doing this to me ?
i hate you !
i won 't go away !
the son of the traitor too will die
kill him !
poor UNknown was fatally stabbed
i am cursed
this UNknown body has caused only misery and pain to those around me
UNknown 's young life was taken away by the merciless justice
take away the criminal !
come on hurry !
UNknown was taken away
death and oblivion are what awaits us beyond the borders of our earthly life
the time has come for him to depart this UNknown world
filled with despair he was about to leave for the land of no return
too pure to be judged by the earthly laws
UNknown died of his own hand
he put an end to his stormy and tragic life
the wind was singing its sad song
skull the end
featuring a trinity of pictures UNknown and music such UNknown enjoyed enormous popularity
japan has an ancient and rich UNknown tradition
the art of UNknown UNknown from this tradition
the talking UNknown series is a modern re creation of this art
this series presented by UNknown UNknown features select films from the collection of the famous UNknown and my teacher UNknown UNknown
the UNknown include a rich variety of films from classic masterpieces to fine and rare pieces
this dvd features two films starring UNknown UNknown
color print UNknown
filmed when UNknown UNknown was in his early UNknown
color print of edo UNknown the talent of this dazzling actor
the story takes place in the early edo period sometime in the mid to iate 1 7th century
in that period edo was the scene of fierce battles between two gangs the hatamoto UNknown and the UNknown UNknown
the most famous hatamoto UNknown was UNknown mizuno and the most famous UNknown UNknown UNknown UNknown
the main hero in this film UNknown UNknown belongs to the UNknown clan
historic figures such as UNknown the dog killer and the busybody UNknown UNknown appear in this enjoyable and amusing period film
it tells the story of two brothers one is a respected samurai and the other a city servant who hates the samurai
isn 't that strange ?
after all UNknown UNknown rose to fame with the idle vassal series
he 's a man with a moon shaped scar
i find it very interesting that the actor who perfected the role of a samurai plays a city servant in this film
another notable feature is the splendid costumes
since the idle vassal series UNknown UNknown was famous for his UNknown outfits
do not miss the decorations and the set
the samurai mansion of kojiro miura UNknown 's brother played by UNknown UNknown
there is an inner garden
the garden is enclosed by a UNknown hall
the UNknown in the hall is decorated with checkered UNknown UNknown
checkered is the pattern of the belt worn by miura 's lover
and when UNknown appears we see him wearing a checkered kimono
we see great attention to detail in this film
in the scene when the two brothers fight the servants watch in suspense across the garden where exotic palm trees grow
the scenes in this film are UNknown pleasing
i hope you enjoy them
the actresses wear their hair in UNknown knots a style typical of the early edo period
the film is an elaborate UNknown of edo
the dazzling performance by UNknown UNknown takes another dimension in the second film
he became a star at UNknown productions
once established as a star he followed the iikes of UNknown bando
UNknown kataoka and UNknown UNknown who established independent production companies
UNknown too set up his own production company in UNknown UNknown
the second film skull was made in 1 927 by his company
in this UNknown we see UNknown in his 20s
he is young and slender UNknown handsome and sensitive
the plot is very unusual
a group of christians UNknown the edo government
it is a very unusual story
the bright and easy going UNknown plays a gloomy and passionate character obsessed with strong emotions
it wasn 't an easy role for him
in skull UNknown will charm you with his dark and passionate side
UNknown by fierce fighting scenes the UNknown of this film drew great attention back then
the full version was iost but i hope you will enjoy this extraordinary film
in my UNknown i UNknown the dark and passionate side of UNknown UNknown
it was created as a talkie but the sound in the remaining film was destroyed
so the sound elements were removed and UNknown UNknown was added as with silent films
the japanese subtitle of the film contains two UNknown charged words hatamoto and UNknown
i would iike to explain the meaning of these terms
the story takes place in the feudal edo period
during edo japan was divided into several hundred UNknown each governed by a UNknown iord called UNknown
the tokugawa shogun was the biggest UNknown and had national authority
tokugawa had his headquarters in edo modern tokyo
the tokugawa clan ruled over the edo domain but in reality it played the role of a central government
this central government had many direct UNknown
they were called hatamoto
the hatamoto had the same social rank as the UNknown lords but their economic position was much weaker
their income was one UNknown or less of that of the UNknown UNknown
of course there were some very rich hatamoto as well as some very poor ones
but the poor hatamoto were equal to the UNknown UNknown
the hatamoto samurai or shogun servants occupied important posts in the central government
that was after all their duty
however there were many hatamoto without any posts
they were necessary as a military force to put down UNknown UNknown by local UNknown but not all hatamoto had posts in the system
so these hatamoto without posts were paid wages by the shogun but had no work to do
some of them had quite a bad reputation
they were known as hatamoto UNknown
in that period edo was a unique city on a global scale
in the beginning of the 1 8th century its population was 1 3 million
edo was one of the world 's biggest cities in that period
one reason for this UNknown boom is that UNknown lords and their UNknown some 500 000 people came to edo from other regions
this was the so called alternate attendance system
under this system every fourth year
UNknown UNknown had to move between their UNknown and edo typically spending alternate years in each place
they were something iike hostages
for these reasons
maybe there were even more UNknown
that is why edo had a huge samurai population
samurai accounted for some 40 of the population
overall samurai accounted for about 5 7 of japan 's population so in that sense edo was a unique city
what were the results of this UNknown boom ?
in principle local lords and their UNknown could choose their servants from their native areas
these servants remained in the samurai household for generations and forged a strong relationship of trust with their master
they became a part of the family
so acts of treachery were unheard of
but the situation in edo was different
the newly arrived UNknown UNknown and UNknown had to choose their servants from the residents of edo or UNknown strangers
there were employment agencies who provided such servants
so in edo the masters didn 't have a close relationship with their UNknown
they didn 't trust each other
the servant could betray his master
if the servant had been in the family for generations he wouldn 't be punished too hard
however with the edo hired hand the UNknown lord or his UNknown sometimes even killed the treacherous servant
there were cases when servants would be killed for trifling matters
this prompted servants to form their own union to oppose their masters
so if for an instance a master killed his servant over a minor quibble the servant 's friends would take revenge and then run
they would run to the ieader of their union who would hide them
thus a mafia like structure or yakuza was formed
in edo they were called UNknown UNknown or city servants
they were the citizens mafia
their UNknown were highly respected
when their men were abused at the estate of a local iord they raised their voice and took revenge
so this newly established mafia iike structure was iocked in a UNknown relationship of UNknown with the samurai
as for the UNknown UNknown they were quite popular with the edo citizens
in response to this the jobless hatamoto samurai that i described before UNknown over their situation swore to punish the outrageous UNknown UNknown
so these samurai were given the name hatamoto UNknown which UNknown the terms hatamoto and UNknown UNknown
they were something like gangster samurai
and the UNknown UNknown organized in a mafia like structure were the enemy of the hatamoto UNknown
fights often UNknown between these two UNknown groups
the hero in color print of edo is called UNknown UNknown
he was a hatamoto UNknown
this is a difficult word to translate
well literally translated
there were the samurai gangster groups and their enemies the street gangster groups
there were several UNknown famous hatamoto UNknown but eventually the most prominent one of them was ordered by the shogun to commit seppuku
the trifling quarrels of samurai with UNknown apparently UNknown the shogun
so UNknown UNknown UNknown was a prominent hatamoto UNknown
but the story in this film is greatly UNknown
it is the story of a hatamoto UNknown who rejected his boring iife and became a UNknown UNknown
the story is told with humorous comical touches
but this film UNknown some UNknown in the samurai society
UNknown UNknown the iead actor in color print of edo was one of the biggest and most popular stars of was one of the biggest and most popular stars of
japan 's period film cinema
there were five or six other stars of his caliber but he was indeed one of the most renowned actors in the iong history of period films
one of the reasons is probably his iong UNknown popularity
his UNknown career continued for some 40 years
like other actors he came from the kabuki world
his physical UNknown and elegant performance developed through the kabuki practice made him a film star
he was very good in the fighting scenes
such dances were extremely beautiful but failed to convey the true nature of the fighting and were extremely UNknown
this trend prevailed in films for about a decade as the audience was satisfied with the kabuki style scenes
but in the second half of the UNknown a revolution of a kind occurred
one of the factors for this revolution was the influence of us films
hollywood films of this period particularly films starring douglas fairbanks featured amazing UNknown scenes with UNknown elements that captured audiences
for instance the performance of douglas fairbanks in films like the mark of zorro
the three musketeers or the thief of bagdad
he is jumping and bouncing like a circus acrobat
realizing that this performance style was much more interesting
japanese actors wasted no time in UNknown it
UNknown UNknown was one of them
he was able to perform extremely fierce fighting scenes and still maintain the UNknown good iooks of a kabuki actor
this in my opinion was the secret of his popularity
even iate in iife UNknown UNknown remained an imposing presence with roles such as a yakuza boss or a great magnificent samurai
he was so magnificent that he could scare the enemy off with his mere presence
he was very good at this kind of fighting
his style was dashing and UNknown more a show than real fighting
also unlike other period film stars UNknown UNknown played only ieading parts and never accepted supporting parts
he pledged that he would retire when he couldn 't perform ieading parts anymore
unlike other actors he wasn 't willing to UNknown work as a side character
he used to say that if at some point his popularity UNknown and he had to put up with minor roles he would quit
he wanted to remain a hero to the end
after all there were many minor parts in which an actor could demonstrate his talent
but they weren 't good enough for UNknown
he wanted to end his career as a hero UNknown admired by UNknown fans
i met UNknown UNknown
i asked him what kind of issues he considered when he was given a role
his reply was very unexpected
the costumes he said
what kimono would be most appropriate
he used to consult with UNknown on his costumes like an actress
i was really surprised
but i was also impressed
for UNknown UNknown the most important thing was to iook good for his UNknown fans
that is why he carefully picked his costumes and changed more than ten times in a single film
his costumes were unusual but extremely beautiful
i remember saying to myself he was indeed a kabuki star
he was an extremely cheerful person with a generous heart
he wasn 't snobbish
he was a friendly and warm person
i have very fond memories of my interview with him
and still he was really devoted to his appearance and considered it a kind of service he owed his fans
UNknown UNknown was indeed a great star
the second film skull is a silent movie
the plot is a bit unusual
it tells the story of a christian local iord
a few hundred years ago some UNknown UNknown embraced christianity
in the 14th 15th century during the UNknown states period
japan was divided into numerous UNknown that fought against each other
in that UNknown era society enjoyed certain UNknown
of course the constant wars were a significant burden but there was freedom of religion
in that period some UNknown UNknown were baptized
but when the UNknown states period ended and the edo shogunate took over total control the central government decided to eliminate christianity
the christian UNknown were persecuted and eventually UNknown
this film tells the story of a warlord who fought on the side of these christian lords
the battle he puts up is tragic and doomed to fail
this film is directed by UNknown UNknown
it is his debut film as a director
UNknown UNknown left behind very few films
he perished in the nuclear blast in hiroshima
he was mobilized in the army and eventually died in the atomic bombing in hiroshima
judging from the UNknown directed fighting scenes
i believe he would have made an excellent director
his early demise was a great loss
the young eagles
ln UNknown the old university town
ln the autumn of 1918
what good old days
what followed is known all too well
as an impartial i advise the sides to settle the case pointing attention to the fact that a settlement is not UNknown
but now the autumn of 1918 what vile winds are blowing across the land
UNknown 'n UNknown nd there is a meeting tonight in the common room of the fraternity
all brothers are to attend it
the issue of volunteering for the people 's army is on the agenda
ln the countryside at the homestead of UNknown the blacksmith
the girl is probably the daughter of a ranger ?
do not go to war sonny
i will no longer be UNknown the blacksmith if i let the enemy UNknown my homeland
there were other places as well where there was no less enthusiasm and anger
UNknown 'n master the UNknown of UNknown household and a few other lads

ln the meantime the russian bolsheviks plundered border villages

russian officers and the UNknown had settled into UNknown 's house in j UNknown village

his sister manages to escape thanks to UNknown 's cunning

soon the artillery arrived in the village

line the cue up straight one two three !
you will definitely be a soldier here have another UNknown for a prize
the volunteers UNknown UNknown with the guns they had captured from the enemy earlier in the morning

the following scenes have been lost
UNknown UNknown resting
time has passed
UNknown are concerned about the enemy numbers which surpass them UNknown
the russians obtain intelligence about the approaching armoured train
assured of their imminent victory they begin to celebrate
step by step yet UNknown our soldiers liberated the homeland from the invading enemy
ln spite of the immense hardships involved the UNknown was formed under enemy fire
yet the enemy gathered great numbers for striking a decisive blow and to make up for their losses
however our men did not stand UNknown by
think UNknown nd a familiar girl !
fine child yet tell her to stop crying
i cannot stand a beautiful girl crying
why does the maiden cry ?
this morning the enemy came and captured my father
i hid myself in the hay loft with my dog they are somewhere nearby

it took some time before UNknown nd got healed
the war had already ended when he left the clinic
and the brave men who had liberated their homeland returned to their ordinary everyday lives
UNknown nd our second young eagle did not brawl in UNknown any longer but graduated from the university and
oh good old days of youth where have you gone ?
your unlimited freedom has drifted into the sea of time
to no avail my eyes are looking for you
no trace can i find anymore UNknown UNknown UNknown !
o UNknown est UNknown UNknown !
brave UNknown our third young eagle lays at rest amongst many others in the soil of the homeland liberated with his own blood
there is no greater love than to give one 's life for one 's friends
one week until the statute of limitations
i 'm begging you
please tell me the truth
what exactly is this ?
i don 't know
UNknown is my lover !
that stuff about studying abroad was a lie too right ?
you used an alias and got close to me with the goal of hiding this notebook in my house
you intended to UNknown me from the start
let 's go already
the other day i went into the archives to do research
this notebook came out with a book
i was surprised
it was completely filled with western food UNknown
but what surprised me more than everything was the scent
you understand right ?
it smells great !
thank god !
in short it was in order to not leave any fingerprints on that notebook right ?
the question is why did you try to hide this in my house ?
in the first place why did you have this notebook ?
the answer is in the hayashi rice 's recipe
it 's the same recipe as togami tei 's original hayashi rice
i finally know the reason you cried after eating our hayashi rice
what you ate when you were a child was ariake 's hayashi rice
if i recall you answered that your childhood friend 's name was UNknown san
but that was also an alias
it was actually ariake san right ?
the police suspect my dad
if the cops found this notebook instead of me it could have become conclusive evidence
evidence saying that my father killed ariake san to steal ariake 's flavor
that UNknown san was your objective
you 'r e wrong
i won 't know if you stay quiet UNknown san !
you 'r e wrong
don 't call me that name !
then what exactly should i call you ?
the night of the incident my brother saw the culprit
plus the hayashi rice 's flavor was exactly the same
i can 't think that 's a simple coincidence either
you also think my father is the culprit ?
i 'm sorry
not answering your phone calls was also
i thought the next time we met you would propose to me
i had planned to
it 's true
i never thought this would happen
canadian home cooking
it was written in a newspaper from that time that the children were out late at night when the incident occurred
why were children out in the middle of the night alone ?
UNknown no UNknown meteor 's bond
shining in the sky twinkling
the stars start to blur
it 's so beautiful it 's sad
i want tell you about this and that
i grasp and embrace them while they 'r e UNknown
they say when you wish upon a star someday it will come true but we can only meet in dreams now
shining in the sky twinkling
the stars start to blur
on the way home my tears won 't stop
memories in the sky surface
the tears pour out
i UNknown l never forget
i won 't forget
during an important scene don 't be all happy about getting some perfume
it 's like tai is saying
i was careless
i think at that moment
i forgot about mom and dad
i admit that
if by any chance UNknown gives it to the police our plan will end there
the UNknown evidence will provide a clue
the three of us will be arrested and charged with fraud
that 's fine
originally we hid the notebook because we wanted the cops to find it
i don 't think he UNknown l turn it in to the police
why not ?
so what do you think he UNknown l do UNknown ?
i don 't know but
of course their 's no way togami would admit it but
i think he UNknown l at least be able to tell if his dad is lying or not
what i 'm the most afraid of is him not doing anything
not doing anything ?
on the contrary we could consider him getting rid of the notebook itself
he 's not a coward
but no one wants to believe their own father is a murderer !
it wouldn 't be strange to consider him pretending he didn 't see the notebook until the statute of limitations
there 's a week left right ?
if we don 't do something
we UNknown l get UNknown san on our side
brother you don 't mean
you said you don 't mind being caught right ?
there 's no time to hesitate anymore
what are you calling me out here for ?
old man hunting ?
if you weren 't a detective you would kill the culprit
what about that ?
this is UNknown
well of course
the truth is we UNknown e been living together since we left the institution
we 'r e UNknown
she got caught up in UNknown trade
we committed fraud in order to get the money back
that gave us a taste for success
we tricked people out of money one by one
the targets were people like UNknown 's previous boss or someone who had an affair with her childhood friend
we tricked everyone UNknown
it wasn 't just me i even made my little brother and sister criminals
i 'm sure somewhere
i think i became UNknown thinking it didn 't matter what i did
if you can make an analysis so calmly then why did you do something so stupid ! ?
i didn 't want to let them suffer anymore
i 'm sorry
besides why are you telling me this after all this time ?
the truth is
he was the successor to a western food chain
togami masayuki 's son UNknown
that night i ate togami tei 's hayashi rice
it 's flavor was exactly the same as ariake 's flavor
are you sure ?
it didn 't resemble it
it was stolen
we had togami touch the watch we took as a memento of our dad
don 't make him touch it dammit
how crafty are you ?
the police were successfully UNknown
if it had gone according to plan we wouldn 't have revealed ourselves halfway through
you were found out ?
that ended up in the hands of the enemy
to be honest there 's nothing we can do anymore
it would be difficult to search their house with the evidence you guys made up
we the police only have one trump card
but if i recall the fingerprints had been wiped
a threat ?
it 's no time to be choosing your means
i 'm going to pretend i didn 't hear what we talked about today
translation and UNknown by UNknown get more j drama at d addicts
do not UNknown onto streaming sites !
i don 't need it
you too ?
since i 'm going to UNknown today and tomorrow i thought i 'd buy her a souvenir
i wonder if she likes fish ?
she won 't be coming here anymore
this is a once in a lifetime chance
if you like study abroad in canada too !
don 't say such stupid things
i 'm going first
alright where you like to meet ?
i 'm ariake UNknown
it 's the truth
that 's how it is
now that you mention it something does come to mind
something that 's a pain to remember
your advice was always accurate
well of course it was
you were pulling her strings
yes to be honest it was extremely easy
i can 't believe you
i can 't believe you !
he 's my little brother
the basis that my father is the culprit is the hayashi rice like i thought ?
that flavor isn 't something you match on accident
since i UNknown e seen this i don 't have any intention of denying it
there were many other recipe 's besides the hayashi rice that were similar to togami tei 's
to be honest
who would have thought he was a murderer
but that and murder are different
my father is not that kind of foolish person
you 'r e still gonna say that ! ?
i saw your dad come out that night !
stop UNknown !
your dad is a murderer !
why aren 't you saying anything ! ?
just this notebook alone doesn 't qualify as evidence of murder right ?
trump card ?
put it there ?
in other words it didn 't turn into evidence
that was 14 years ago
but it 's different now
there is a way to identify a person called dna identification
you mean to calculating if it 's the culprit by hair or blood ?
but it 's not that kind of thing
it can identify the person by sweat or the grease from their hands
there 's no way you would tell me what that forgotten item was ?
what kind of idiot would tell the enemy what their trump card is ?
i 'm an enemy ?
what do you mean give it a try ?
the plan to hide the recipe notebook failed
that 's why we UNknown l challenge with a different plan
i UNknown l help this time
what are you saying ! ?
are you an idiot ?
are you serious ?
i know !
but more than that
the night the incident happened
i heard you all went to see the stars
what about that ?
the columns are divided for the number of stars we saw
this is me and this is my father
when you look at the record for november 18th
UNknown meteor shower
but my father
even though the rain let up at night and you could see the shooting stars he wasn 't at home
my father doesn 't have an alibi
let 's do it ariake san
let 's setup a plan !
what a surprise
it 's not like he 's on our side
he probably wants to settle this himself
that 's the kind of person togami is
he doesn 't think about loss or benefit
he 's straightforward
then you don 't have to
i said you don 't have to say it !
is that right ?
i didn 't ask for the details but
there was something the culprit left at the scene of the crime and they were going to calculate it from that
was that alright ?
seems that way
i changed the wallpaper
i 'm on standby by cell phone
if anything happens call me
yeah i UNknown l do that
but that 's great
that had always bothered me
that was my and everyone affected by that incident 's wish
even if we 'r e UNknown ?
i wonder ?
i thought that from the bottom of my heart
it 's fine for the family of the deceased to smile right ?
it sure has been long huh ?
14 years ?
you sure have tried your hardest
hey you know
i UNknown l make it again
i 'm serious
do you want some ?
yeah i guess i UNknown l have some
smells great !
alright let 's eat !
what did you just say ?
it 's UNknown beef right ?
it 's hayashi rice !
what 's with you axel ?
it 's nothing to get mad about axel !
i don 't care if you call me weird names
don 't fight !
it 's a flavor with 100 years of history !
looks delicious !
thank you for the food !
you don 't need the ied
day of the statute of limitations
i 'm UNknown
you 'r e totally a full grown woman !
the same reaction as i had
do you remember me ?
i wonder if i actually look like a detective ?
can i tell you the truth ?
you want to go with forensics after all ?
change after all this time ?
plus there aren 't any UNknown UNknown that wear sunglasses
neither would wear sunglasses
it UNknown l be fine as long as you 'r e dignified
i am UNknown of the UNknown UNknown police
ariake UNknown as detective UNknown
ariake UNknown newcomer as detective tanaka
ariake UNknown newcomer as detective tanaka
we are in charge of dna testing for the case
i am telling you this because there was finger grease left on the handle portion
that dna is being identified
have the results come out ?
they couldn 't know so fast
this time it is close to the statute of limitations so tanaka UNknown here specially took prompt action
the results show a 99 9 dna match
this is a number that will be considered a match in court
that 's just not possible !
there must be some mistake !
tanaka UNknown show him the document with the results
no thanks !
dad let 's call a lawyer
i can call one right ?
well sit down
if it fails we UNknown l both be fired
the family of the deceased UNknown detectives and asks leading questions based on fake evidence
that 's what we 'r e watching without saying anything
this scientifically proves that you touched the handle of that item left at the scene
please tell the truth
please wait !
what do you mean ?
maybe he made a mistake and touched a stranger 's
or the opposite maybe the culprit stole the one my father used
beyond being proved he touched it there is need to hear his story in detail
you will accompany us right ?
if i recall at that time there was one use liked to use right ?
you said it was light and easy to hold
that was stolen right ?
was it stolen ?
it happened !
what kind was it ?
wait a second
why did you know it was an umbrella ?
no one has said the item left at the scene was an umbrella
you showed your faults huh togami san ?
you can 't run anymore
even your son is a witness
what is this about UNknown ?
that 's what i want to ask
what 's wrong ?
i didn 't intend to betray you
i believed you
what is this about UNknown ?
explain this to me
it 's not something i UNknown e forgotten in 14 years
that night even though you promised we would watch the UNknown meteor shower together
you had gone out at night father right ?
anyway there 's one thing i want to tell you
i 'm begging you !
give yourself up !
UNknown you 'r e joking right ?
you 'r e telling a joke right ?
detectives are waiting outside
it UNknown l probably be a little better in court if you voluntarily give yourself up
i 'm begging you father !
at lease don 't show your UNknown !
find out about me ?
my brother caught sight of you in front of the UNknown restaurant
is that right ?
i 'm their little sister
is that right ?
you killed our mother
bastard try saying that again !
let go of me !
i can 't take it anymore
i 'm gonna kill this bastard !
when we 'r e going to kill him i UNknown l do it !
we UNknown l inquire about the detailed story another time
please continue the story
the flavor ariake san made is the base for ours
i stole your father 's flavor !
he was bold and creative yet truly delicate
is this about him gambling ?
if it wasn 't for that around now not togami tei but
ariake would UNknown e probably become a famous restaurant
when we were in UNknown chou i got into a dispute once when i was out on deliveries
what 's disgusting about my food ! ?
disgusting is disgusting you bastard !
when i asked i was told that man also ran a western food restaurant in UNknown
out of spite i went to UNknown
i thought i 'd tear the place up if it was disgusting
it was that delicious
think about that yourself !
i 'm begging you !
at this rate our only choice is to skip town !
i UNknown l pay what it 's worth !
buying our flavor for money
don 't look down on this person !
i piled research on research but i couldn 't possibly reach ariake san 's flavor
it made me realize my own UNknown
however about a month later i was contacted by ariake san
he offered that i buy the recipe
from my dad ! ?
you 'r e lying
no it 's not a lie
i told you not to look inside !
this makes everything clear
certainly it was me that you witnessed that night
i went to your house to get these UNknown
it wasn 't me that killed your parents !
what ! ?
translation and UNknown by UNknown get more j drama at d addicts

you 'r e the culprit right ?
the shocking final episode
i had realized that quite a long time ago
is that alright brother ?
there 's no way in hell it 's alright !
UNknown no UNknown meteor 's bond
shining in the sky twinkling
the stars start to blur
it 's so beautiful it 's sad
i want tell you about this and that
i grasp and embrace them while they 'r e UNknown
they say when you wish upon a star someday it will come true but we can only meet in dreams now
shining in the star twinkling
the stars start to blur
on the way home my tears won 't stop
memories in the sky surface
the tears pour out
i UNknown l never forget
i won 't forget
translation and UNknown by UNknown get more j drama at d addicts

this is stupid
but if you are in love with him
don 't say in love and stuff
you love togami right ?
i said i don 't !
two weeks until the statute of limitations
i said i don 't !
two weeks until the statute of limitations
i just talked with him about breaking up
two weeks until the statute of limitations
what did he say ?
what did he say ?
before you study abroad
what are we gonna do brother ?
we 'r e going to plant the notebook in togami 's house right ?
can you do that ?
what do you mean ?
you 'r e trying to say i UNknown l fail because i love togami san
i knew you love him !
i said i don 't !
even now you call him togami san
that 's why me and UNknown are being cautious
i think it 's different for tai
i think tai is just jealous
is that right ?
of all people UNknown is in love with the UNknown son
plus it 's that father complex bastard
togami san doesn 't have a father complex
probably because you say weird things
that 's enough !
i said we don 't have time !
we can 't change direction after all this time
that 's why we have to make the cops get evidence that togami masayuki is the criminal even a day faster
i said i UNknown l do it
believe in me !
thank you very much
i ate it when i was a kid
it sticks in your teeth
it seems that manufacturing stopped over ten years ago
i 'm home
UNknown this is a detective from the UNknown UNknown police
i 'm UNknown
please come over here
did something happen with this ?
you lived in UNknown chou previously right ?
that was over ten years ago
the truth is we found this in your previous house
currently that place is a used bookstore
recently it was UNknown and this was stolen then
the second story has been turned into a storage room but there was evidence of something being stolen from above the ceiling in the closet
but the manager and the young man working there say they don 't remember these
do you recall these togami san ?
i don 't
what 's wrong ?
yes it 's not a problem
as a matter of fact that watch is unique
could you look at the back ?
there 's something written huh ?
it 's something sent by a well UNknown to a certain western food restaurant 's seven year anniversary
i don 't
we can 't talk about that
if you have some knowledge of this watch it 's a different story though
i don 't think we have anything to do with it
i don 't know why this was in that house
not to mention that it 's not something we would leave behind
is that right ?
if you remember anything please call this number
man i UNknown e gotten hungry
hey UNknown !
it 's hayashi rice
would it be alright for us to have some ?
as expected of a detective
you UNknown e investigated that much in advance huh ?
did you do meal delivery previously ?
it was UNknown because they were charged with doing UNknown on horse races but
i heard this from the manager there
he said a customer got meal delivery from togami tei
i think you UNknown e met before
could you please quit ?
asking about this and that under your own conditions and not telling us anything essential
to be quite honest it makes me sick
that 's right UNknown
we have to help them out
then at least tell us what kind of case this is
a murder case
but if we don 't we can 't show them how serious we are
for now let 's just compare the fingerprints
but it sure was good
the hayashi rice
no way in hell
didn 't she pick at dad 's hayashi rice ?
same with the detective a second ago
they 'r e envious of us
it 's fine bringing her over
tell me if you decide to in the coming days
i UNknown l take off work
i UNknown it down to ariake western food restaurant and murder case
and then this
at the western food restaurant ariake in UNknown city the store owner ariake UNknown san and his wife UNknown san 's bodies were discovered
the weapon was a western style kitchen knife that came from inside the restaurant
is there something about this ?
the restaurant UNknown UNknown san remembers was in UNknown
her parents died in an accident
and then the restaurant closed down
could this be a coincidence ?
no it isn 't huh ?
what was her name ?
was it ariake san ?
no it was UNknown san
ah well then it 's probably a coincidence
look UNknown has a lot of western food restaurants
no no no
that time i was irritated
may i ask ?
why don 't you take a break ?
but the cops are moving from something like that huh ?
they really are
but i 'm really curious about ariake san
by the way where is UNknown san ?
young people recently are quick to lose interest
you have to make sure to firmly tell her
of course that 's my intention !
ah sorry sorry
is his dad really the culprit ?
that 's great
like you guys there were countless kids in the institution whose parents had been killed
usually they UNknown l catch them right after the incident
if not it passes statute of limitations
isn 't that how it is now ?
it 's not like your mom and dad are going to come back to life but
with this they UNknown l be able to rest in peace
you guys will finally be able to be independent of your parents
with this they UNknown l be able to rest in peace
you guys will finally be able to be independent of your parents
well i 'm gonna go even if you don 't catch him
even though we 'r e doing that
even though i thought it would get more exciting
that 's from now on
from now on ?
how we live from now on is also important
i mean it 's not like we were born to search for criminal right ?
george san said so too
we UNknown l be independent from our parents
i 'm thinking about it
i talked about it with UNknown before
i UNknown l inherit dad 's flavor
that 's not being independent from our parents
isn 't that you becoming dad ?
that 's not fair
a customer ! ?
because dad was like that
go to school !
she would have called without any reason
do you have a girlfriend ?
what about marriage ?
that 's really annoying so everyone stops UNknown their parents after they pass twenty huh ?
that didn 't happen huh ?
i was wondering what i should wear when i go to togami 's house
hey which is better a suit or a dress ?
i get it
UNknown UNknown will disappear
i am UNknown
i may not need that kind of introduction after all this time
i UNknown l be back
i may not need that kind of introduction after all this time
i UNknown l be back
but i was so shaken that i would UNknown e broken down if i didn 't tell myself that
my mental state was so nervous that i would UNknown e broken if i didn 't tell myself that
why ! ?
she couldn 't possibly have gained this much weight !
what 's your name ?
no no no !
the woman i loved wasn 't UNknown UNknown
she was using a fake name
then her real identity is
that 's because i am the chief of a first class trading firm
yeah but it 's the last time
you decided to wear that ?
yeah i wonder if it 's no good ?
no it 's fine
brother what do you mean by that ?
so what about them ?
is he waiting with his parents ?
nope just his mother
i won 't know until i go there
he 's going to show me around his house
it UNknown l be fine
i UNknown l do well
well then i 'm gonna go
i 'm honored to be invited over here today
it 's sweet bean jelly from UNknown
seriously ! ?
it sold out right when the store opened
i can 't believe you were able to buy it
did you stand in line ?
did you stand in line from morning ?
you 'r e not ?
that again ! ?
what 's this so suddenly ?
where are you ?
i 'm not getting anywhere so i thought i 'd go in there
before that could you have a look at togami 's face and confirm that it 's him ?
this is bad brother
why ! ?
it 's too soon !
we haven 't hidden the notebook yet
of all days why today ! ?
don 't be so inquisitive
this house is also of foreign design
it was by an architect from france or italy or somewhere
he was german
we 'r e going to show you around later
oh no i have to straighten up !
there are clothes everywhere upstairs
it 's fine
isn 't this kid annoying ?
he UNknown me every single time
from watching too much tv right ?
what was that again ?
the idiot and the UNknown ?
the straight man !
what 's so good about this kid ?
he 's enthusiastic about work and positive
i also like his consideration
he 's too good so he 's let his chances slip by up until this age
he 's my and dad 's son so naturally there 's no way he wouldn 't be well liked
he 's too UNknown
hey UNknown you UNknown e found someone good !
let me see
boiled food sure is difficult
i 'm home !
it 's not something weird right ?
that 's right
i bought it in paris last year but it doesn 't really suit me
i thought it was more suited for young people
it 's a hang me down ?
i haven 't used it !
i think it 's perfect for you
of course i won 't force you
people have UNknown for perfume
it smells great !
i was also against inviting you over
but meeting you has made me happy
he kept his luck aside in order to meet you
UNknown san ?
i got them to have it at night
i can 't help but be worried when you say those things
please excuse me
i don 't know about that
i 'm just a amateur
do you remember the restaurant 's name ?
i asked that but she said she doesn 't remember
it wasn 't ariake right ?
no her friend 's name was UNknown san
it wasn 't
make yourself at home
you 'r e late
so are you coming or not ?
cabaret club ?
i thought i 'd ask you too since this pretty rare
this is the guest room
it 's UNknown
it must be because japanese want to have their feet on UNknown
is that bowl also an obsession of your father 's ?
are you interested in UNknown ?
i can 't touch it with my bare hands huh ?
no it 's fine
i always carry them
if i do this i can touch it without worrying
you UNknown e moved me again
there aren 't many women who can be so considerate
plus you 'r e really casual
i 'm sure your parents raised you well
stop you UNknown l make me drop it
the archive is next
yes your father bought you your first one
this is it
they sure were pretty
well then this way
it UNknown not just western food but UNknown from all over the world
he may not look it but he 's a hard worker
even now he sometimes UNknown himself to this room and doesn 't come out for hours
are you still showing her around ?
no we 'r e pretty much done with the second floor
well then let 's go have some sweet bean jelly downstairs
would it be alright if i used the UNknown before that ?
go to the end of the hall and it 's on your left
it 's confusing huh ?
excuse me i need to go to the b bathroom
yes excuse me
i 'm not
UNknown should be back soon so when you see an opportunity go back to the apartment
sorry for keeping you so late
i also had a lot of fun
UNknown san i have a request
if possible before you leave for canada
i have something i must discuss with you
your fingerprints were found on this watch
my fingerprints ?
i wonder why that is ?
probably because you touched it
but i have no recollection
it was above the ceiling
do you think you may have forgotten that you left it in such a special place ?
it wasn 't me that left it there
or were my fingerprints found on the can too ?
don 't you think it would be appropriate to think that someone else hid it in the ceiling ?
at that time i thought that if he was trying to play dumb he 's quite a formidable enemy
it 's practically exactly like that guy said
it 's certainly strange that fingerprints didn 't show up anywhere except the watch
i don 't think so
he didn 't know my dad when he saw his picture
he said that ?
what 's disgusting about my food ! ?
disgusting is disgusting you bastard !
i asked him that too
but he said he didn 't remember
he said it without batting an UNknown
the cops are gonna believe that huh ?
we don 't believe it but with that the fingerprints alone are insufficient
you have the portrait right ?
UNknown could look at him directly
a police line up is a decision of the UNknown police and they have decided to postpone it
they said at this level
at this level
can you search his house ?
you may be able to find something in his house that UNknown him to the incident !
what the hell are you my boss ?
i mean you 'r e not doing anything are you ?
that was before the fingerprints matched
we have evidence and an eyewitness now
there is enough evidence saying that togami is the culprit !
that 's it
and because of that the investigation has progressed
something bothers me
but the car thief hasn 't been caught
you know UNknown UNknown
who would do that and for what purpose ?
i ate hayashi rice at togami 's house
it was delicious
it really brought me back
you still remember our flavor ?
because i came countless times
your dad 's hayashi rice sure was delicious
if we find the culprit what are you gonna do ?
forget that i 'm a detective
think it 's just a question from an old man passed his UNknown then answer
what would you do if you found out who the culprit was ?
if you weren 't a cop what would you do ?
hurry up and eat it
he said he was going to propose right ?
she cries and just drinks
it 's already been four days
i wanted you to be the first to eat it
you seem really close tonight
didn 't you go to canada ?
what are you doing in a place like this ?
i 'm sorry
t then why didn 't you contact me ! ?
do you have any idea how much you hurt me ! ?
do you have any idea how much i was waiting ! ?
do you have any idea ! ?
do you have any idea at all ! ?
please let go of me
what should we do ?
please let go of me !
give me an answer
who are you ?
UNknown is my lover
UNknown san ?
you think you are seeing her
well then let 's negotiate
i also UNknown welcome it
we UNknown l make a contract
if you don 't want to
i UNknown l be in contact again
i gave a UNknown bad performance
was that alright ?
i knew it
sometimes you have to bluff
but i 'm glad i was able to see you
excuse me for calling so persistently
i had something important to talk to you about so i wanted to see you no matter what
i 'm sorry too
the truth is
huh ! ?
translation and UNknown by UNknown get more j drama at d addicts
do not UNknown onto streaming sites !
i 'm ariake UNknown
there 's no mistake
UNknown togami masayuki
to be honest i don 't really think he looks that similar
i 'm not talking about whether or not he does
i 'm saying it 's him !
calm down UNknown
so i definitely won 't forget !
there 's no doubt it 's him !
even being told that
i can 't hate any other
that 's why i wanted them to draw that kind of face
i wonder if he was going in the restaurant as a customer ?
then UNknown met him ?
what 'd you mean ?
we 'r e not gonna know if you don 't say anything
UNknown what happened ?
so you ate it right ?
was it good ?
it was the exact same flavor
that 's a lie
i was surprised
i couldn 't hold back my tears
the other day didn 't brother make hayashi rice ?
but you didn 't cry right ?
that wasn 't dad 's hayashi rice the other day
the recipe was the same but
i just used whatever ingredients i had
and some parts were just adequate
what a huge shock
do you get it ?
my tongue remembered it i guess
it was closer than brother 's hayashi rice
actually it was it
there are no coincidences
then what do you mean ! ?
i 'm saying that one of them was copied
i don 't know which came first though
are you serious ?
his dad ?
UNknown togami masayuki
there 's no way i 'd understand something you don 't
he 's the man that came out of the back door that night
let 's sort this out real quick
the flavor of the hayashi rice that UNknown ate tonight was exactly the same as dad 's
i 'm UNknown 's father
in other words
why not ! ?
calm down UNknown !
but we don 't have evidence
evidence ! ?
there have been countless suspicious guys and every time we UNknown e gone from hope to disappointment
this will be the 14th year we catch a criminal get our expectations up and are disappointed
i 'm sick of it already
it 's exactly like you said
i don 't want to be disappointed anymore
let 's actually make sure
how the hell would we do that ! ?
leave it to me

the founder togami masayuki made the restaurant big with his famous hayashi rice
there are currently three restaurants in metropolitan areas
one in osaka
togami tei is a chain but the appearance and flavor of each restaurant is different
this is an obsession of mr masayuki
especially the hayashi rice is special and
ah excuse me
has it always had this flavor ?
no when the president was in the kitchen it was an orthodox hayashi rice
that was when the restaurant was still in UNknown chou
wow i want to try that
unfortunately it isn 't being served anywhere right now
is it that big of a deal ?
i 'm fine but it UNknown l be bad if brother finds out
he UNknown l tell you to wear work gloves
it 's not that weird
he was trying to calm me down
was it like this ?
or like this ?
this and this mean completely different things !
this is gentleness
hey excuse me customer ?
damn hide !
that 's hayashi rice right ?
hey hayashi rice please
man the inside of my mouth is still sticky
these were good
so about the man in the sketch
that 's true
there have been countless people that just looked similar
there have also been reports from the public
do you still have the list of those people ?
of course it 's at the UNknown central police station
so then you want to check if the man 's name is on the list ?
is that it ?
it 's getting close to the statute of limitations so i 'm feeling a little rushed too
there 's no way i can show the list to a civilian
how much ?
i like the lively ones
i live alone you know
your UNknown has doubled
so what can i help you with today ?
is it a bother ?
is calling you up even though i don 't have any business a bother ?
that 's why i sometimes invited you out to eat as a follow up
what did you say to decline ?
i don 't know your house 's level of humidity
do you know how much your UNknown UNknown hurt me ?
you don 't have enough delicacy
also your make up is crude
alright then go home
could you disappear ?
it 's fine
is that right ?
kill kill kill
right now i am at the very bottom of UNknown
UNknown UNknown my lover somehow UNknown our marriage promise and started talking about studying abroad in canada
is that it ?
it 's only your portion
we can 't cancel the contract with only half a million
the bond is in UNknown san 's name
she started talking about canceling the dollar based bonds we invested in together
for travel expenses and the cost of studying abroad
to cancel the contract you need the full amount
but if you did that now you would lose a lot of money
yes i understand
hey UNknown chan what you 'r e doing is really selfish
don 't you think so yourself ?
i 'm sorry
but as a person do you think it 's right to cause your lover trouble ?
you can go to canada or wherever
but canceling the contract without listening to your lover 's opinion is
UNknown san i won 't bother you
then canceling the contract ?
we won 't do it
not because i 'm afraid of loss
she will go to canada
if we canceled the contract here our relationship would end
our only tie is the two million bond we bought from you
dollar based bonds are the bond that binds us together !
UNknown how much do you need for travel expenses ?
five hundred thousand
i 'm really sorry
that 's not true UNknown !
even if we 'r e UNknown
we 'r e connected by this sky
thanks for the food !
it 's ariake 's hayashi rice
they 'r e both the same flavor right ?
what about you UNknown ?
with this one
then with this one
yeah exactly like it
i UNknown l properly explain
let 's go upstairs
i piled information on information on what i have to do to get close to dad 's flavor no the flavor of the hayashi rice UNknown ate that night
and then at last yesterday
i UNknown that code
the same as the nagoya branch of my previous company
brother how many days did you say it took again ?
and today i went there
all the way to nagoya ?
dad was fussy about how much of that UNknown sauce to use for UNknown
then i heard they were always friends after the restaurant opened
it smells like the UNknown sauce from before !
but that 's not just it
translation and UNknown by UNknown get more j drama at d addicts

remove if found !
a western food restaurant huh ?
the other day i got an order from the successor of togami tei
togami tei ?
you mean you UNknown e done business with them previously ?
me and the president go way back
we 'r e not like family though
um starting from december UNknown
14 years ago
you 'r e lying right ?
it 's not a lie or a coincidence
14 years ago togami tei stole ariake 's flavor and had a huge success from it
that night the man that came out of the back door was UNknown
aren 't we going to kill him ?
when we get older we UNknown l find the criminal and kill him
we found him !
we 'r e not at that level yet
why ! ?
plus he stole hayashi rice 's flavor !
that 's two things that prove it !
it 's settled for sure this time right ?
then why is the notebook here ! ?
at the murder scene ?
he didn 't know when we were going to get back
sorry i guess that 's not possible
i understand your feelings UNknown but there 's not enough evidence
if it was togami masayuki that was at the scene of the crime that night
not if i 'm telling you it was him one hundred percent !
there was no fingerprints or items left behind to prove that !
we can 't count on the cops
then what are we gonna do ?
change the plan UNknown
we 'r e not aiming for ten million
but for proof that he 's the culprit of the UNknown couple murder case
there 's no need to say it but this is our biggest target yet
at any rate this is the enemy we UNknown e spent 14 years searching for
i 'm hopeless
full of my own affairs only seeking impressions on the food and the restaurant
certainly there 's no doubt it was painful
that night was the same too
did something happen ?
suddenly crying like that
UNknown ! ?
she wouldn 't have cried if she didn 't hate it right ?
i 'm sure she has a UNknown UNknown UNknown
it 's from brother
send a text to togami UNknown
send a text to togami UNknown
he typed without looking halfway though
send a text to togami UNknown
even in the taxi
with all my might i was only able to hold her hand
that 's the gentleness of my power
no it was a dirty heart
i 'm transparent !
i tried to look cool and went home
i 'm hopeless !
you haven 't got in touch with her since then ?
there 's no way i could get in touch with her !
after all this time
like how are you ? and stuff
that 's no good !
of course she 'd just write me back saying leave me alone !
and then my only choice would be to leave her alone
and then if i leave her alone our love would end
i wonder if i UNknown l enter the new year as a virgin this year too ?
it 's from UNknown san
i 'm terribly sorry for worrying you the other day
you don 't really have to read it aloud
thanks to you i UNknown e gotten completely better
thank god !
can we meet soon ! ?
what do i do ! ?
my heart 's racing !
what should i do ?
shouldn 't you just normally answer her ?
t that 's right
type for me real quick
of course meeting you again would make me
isn 't this a little UNknown ?
welcome to my restaurant
it 's under construction
this girl is UNknown UNknown san
i can 't explain well but she 's a precious person
is this the kitchen ?
we don 't intend to cram
i think we 'r e going to keep it at 40 seats
what seat would you sit at ?
alright sit here
don 't show it to her yet
come on hurry up and eat !
thanks for the food !
i knew it !
i can now have confidence in my sense
i will also sit over there
the reason is that the pillar is close and you can have your privacy
at first UNknown the pillar seems in the way but it also works as a cover
naturally if i don 't ensure the employee 's circulation it will cause UNknown but
do you like pillars that much UNknown ! ?
then you should marry a pillar !
have the pillar give birth to your children !
about why i started crying and stuff the other day
can i ask ?
she broke the ice because she wanted you to ask !
the hayashi rice 's flavor
here it is ! was quite similar
my close friend 's house was a western food restaurant and the hayashi rice was delicious
that flavor was
my close friend also moved far away
i remembered that
it 's not lame !
i was touched !
what kind of restaurant was it ?
it was a warm restaurant
there was a pillar exactly like this
it was when i went to eat with my family
i 'm home !
it was when i went to eat with my family
UNknown when i looked at the pillar seat there was a couple sitting there
when they finished their meal the man took out a small box
i didn 't know then because i was a child but it was probably an engagement ring
i still remember how the woman 's face suddenly shined
if that pillar hadn 't been there
i think that man would have been bothered by me watching and wouldn 't have been able to do something that romantic
you said the pillar becomes a cover
that 's exactly it right ?
it 's quite wonderful
let 's get rid of it if there are no problems with the structure
do that and you 'r e fired !
young master ?
these were good
how much ?
we do sales
what 's with that ?
i thought they were just expensive !
that UNknown me off !
i watched all of nude series !
hurry up and put it away !
isn 't this risky ?
but we guarantee the UNknown
by the way wanna go to a more lively place ?
it 's not like i 'm always clinging to UNknown san
what 's wrong ?
you 'r e not going to be at the UNknown central police station anymore ?
i 'm changing to the UNknown UNknown police investigation division
is that a promotion ?
on the outside
anyway the higher ups want to get rid of me and UNknown san who have our hands full with a case we can 't solve
i can 't think of anything else
there 's no way i 'm giving up !
i don 't want you saying you heard it from me but
did you find something out ?
no not that
that guy 's son died the other day
he had a heart disease
he was always in the hospital from before that incident
this kind of UNknown
do you hate it ?
he had countless difficult UNknown
i love it
if i recall he said he and his wife got a divorce
that wife also died nine years ago
so that guy was away from the scene so he could care for his son
how old was he ?
his son ?
his son died and on the day he returned to the scene he came here
i guess he was always caught up
about you guys
that guy won 't say it so
i thought i 'd spread it around
who is george ! ?
me me !
if that was true i would have already taken an administrative position a long time ago but
he 's still on the scene
he thinks of you guys as his real sons so
he seriously UNknown the criminal !
i 'm counting on you to take care of UNknown san
please come again
it 's fine !
i can 't go all the way back to UNknown !
you can !
what a long day
i 'm saying that 's not going to work !
by UNknown do you mean UNknown ?
did something happen with him ?
back then he was the one suspect but he had an alibi
after so long getting a call from him is pretty weird
what ! ?
i 'm properly working
well then i 'm going to get on from here
hey you know
i told you we don 't get along and rarely meet
it 's fine if you tell him
by the way
normally you want to talk about them with someone
i don 't know if he UNknown l come though
well sit down
none of your business !
what are you talking like that to your parents for ?
i 'm sorry
it 's really shocking
huh ! ?
who was it ?
who 's prettier me or her ?
you of course UNknown chan
how boring !
you seem to be meeting quite frequently huh ?
today was the third time
the fourth right ?
why did you reduce it by one time ?
want some pears ?
why was she crying ! ?
i won 't pry but women that age will cry without a reason
i also have experience
you said you were so happy you were scared
you cried a lot huh ?
over the hayashi rice ?
she said it tasted similar to a western food restaurant she went to when she was little
i didn 't ask
some things happened and it suddenly closed down
what 's wrong ?
i don 't know !
no i don 't
if you UNknown e been doing this for many years you UNknown l hear rumors like that
like which place 's flavor resembles which and stuff
we UNknown e never been told that once
she 's trying to pull your interest
there 's nothing else is there ?
it 's obviously a lie that it was similar to the hayashi rice 's flavor
why are you assuming it 's a lie ?
it 's a lie !
why are you assuming it 's a lie ?
you may not know but do you have any idea how much trouble dad went through to invent that flavor ?
enough of that topic
i said that 's enough !
i 'm tired
when is the fifth time ?
when are you going to meet with that UNknown next ?
there are none !
where did you go ?
you met with togami right ?
she said she doesn 't want to see him
then why ?
he 's not suspicious of me at all
he was seriously worried when i cried at the food UNknown party
he easily believed that lame excuse
get a hold of yourself UNknown !
he 's the son of our enemy !
what are you gonna do if you feel sympathy for him ?
i don 't feel sympathetic
well i said that the other day but
but cops aren 't something to toss aside after all
i mean it does make me angry that they left us alone for 14 years
but at least that person UNknown is different i guess
i have a feeling he 's actually working on it
the truth is
we can 't do anything with the three of us
if we 'r e going to rely on someone
i don 't think there 's anyone but UNknown
don 't forget
if the cops search around masayuki the college girl and the jeweler will be easily caught
there 's no mistake that togami tei stole ariake 's flavor
but what we want to know about is
dad and togami masayuki 's UNknown
in other words proof that they were acquaintances
the only one who can get that information is you
do you like italian ?
i love it
get a hold of yourself UNknown !
he 's the son of our enemy
what are you gonna do if you feel sympathy for him ?
change the hayashi rice plan !
excuse me please stop the machines !
i said to stop the hayashi rice plan !
it 's the same for the other restaurants
make your own original hayashi rice too and then put that on this UNknown restaurant 's store
that 's all
don 't complain !
translation and UNknown by UNknown get more j drama at d addicts
do not UNknown onto streaming sites !
remove if found !
it was the exact same flavor as ariake 's hayashi rice
that 's a lie
that night the man that came out of the back door was UNknown
i 'm UNknown 's father
togami 's father is the criminal !
there were no fingerprints or items left behind to prove that !
then what are we gonna do ?
change the plan UNknown
we 'r e not aiming for ten million
but for proof that he 's the culprit of the ariake couple murder case
there 's no need to say it but this is our biggest target yet
the hayashi rice 's flavor
similar to our hayashi rice ?
he 's a good guy
he 's not suspicious of me at all
he was seriously worried when i cried at the food UNknown party
he easily believed that lame excuse
get a hold of yourself UNknown !
he 's the son of our enemy !
what are you gonna do if you feel sympathy for him ?
i know that
that 's all
don 't complain !
but what we want to know about is
dad and togami masayuki 's UNknown
in other words proof that they were acquaintances
the only one who can get that information is you
let 's get revenge
my wife 's been telling me to turn myself in
14 years ?
without batting an UNknown
we interrogated you countless time
but there was nothing to connect you to the incident
and then UNknown
but you see there was in my wife 's head
november 18 UNknown
november 18 UNknown
november 18 UNknown
november 18 UNknown
the day of the incident
november 18 UNknown
november 18 UNknown
today is a little impossible though
it has to be today
she wasn 't your parent huh ?
it seems that UNknown san was the second wife
no she was my mother
some people we knew were being threatened by your mother
she said she would expose their relationship to me if they didn 't pay her money
i can 't have that !
UNknown is your child
you sure are fine with this !
i 'm sorry !
that 's why i 'm saying there wasn 't any
it 's my wife 's delusion
UNknown wasn 't that kind of woman
she wasn 't like one of those women from two hour dramas
giving her money was
i only heard she was working part time at a western food restaurant
and resolved to be with UNknown
i went all the way to UNknown with money in hand
mom how do you write the second character in endurance ?
UNknown 's husband also had children
even so you continued sending money every month
you were being tricked
i was just thinking it wouldn 't be impossible for your wife to think that
i didn 't
getting his story straight with his colleagues
even if he deceived the cops with that i know
he killed them
do you have children ?
my wife wanted children
i couldn 't tell her
i can 't even tell her now !
even though she knows
i 'm going to take it to the grave
how is your little sister ?
i want to meet her face to face and apologize in place of my husband
i 'm sure she has had a lot of hardships
i haven 't seen my sister
she doesn 't know ?
UNknown chou yokohama
it 's a used bookstore now though
i thought he might have come here
i don 't remember every single customer 's face
well guys like your dad who are came all the time are different though
in the end there wasn 't any UNknown between dad and togami masayuki at new UNknown
what a waste
what do i think ?
i don 't know
try thinking about it once more UNknown
that night the man that came out of the back
i said that was togami
there 's no mistaking that it was togami masayuki
are you for certain ?
it wasn 't UNknown ?
i told you i don 't know what that UNknown guy looks like
i 'm beat
which do you think is suspicious ?
i 'm wearing this because i don 't know
UNknown 's wife is convinced that her own husband is the culprit
well she not composed but in a way she does make sense
well more importantly
not too that 's the biggest problem
i know !
not that !
where 's UNknown ?
you mean the UNknown restaurant 's ?
that 's right
that is unfortunate
the truth is i talked to my father about that
she said it 's not there anymore
some things happened and it suddenly closed down
that was the first time i 'd seen my father 's face so serious
and then today
of course i hung onto it
and you had approved of me for once you rotten father !
there 's no way you rotten father !
kind of like that
are you trying to say that experience has become useless ?
if that 's the case you 'r e not qualified to be the manager
although it 's UNknown it 's a sound argument
i can 't say for sure i wasn 't acting spoiled to my father
as i thought
you sure are positive
i don 't think it 's a bad thing to act spoiled towards a parent
besides even your father may have been taught by someone
i 'm moved
i should get someone help me
let 's go
my name is UNknown
is that it ?
you sure are a beautiful person
by the way !
do you have a cold ?
ah well yes
what 's that ! ?
a kitchen date with just the two of them ! ?
calm down UNknown !
why is masayuki making him change the hayashi rice 's flavor after all this time ?
probably because UNknown pointed out that it was similar to dad 's
ariake 's hayashi rice 's flavor
that 's it
haven 't i told you countless times ! ?
togami stole ariake 's flavor !
that 's why he killed mom and dad
that 's why i 'm saying the culprit isn 't UNknown but togami !
i 'm fine with being arrested
fraud is only two or three years at the most right ?
i UNknown l take the blame for you too
what 's gonna happen to UNknown ?
she 's the UNknown
we know how much value that hayashi rice 's recipe has
that was actually what made togami tei big
but it 's different to the cops
they wouldn 't believe that someone would kill for just hayashi rice
of course they UNknown l laugh and say it 's something that victims family just made up
that 's why we UNknown l get more objective evidence like this
by them do you mean the cops ?
i 'm saying a tip is no good
i UNknown l go through the pain to get evidence that anyone will believe
you 'r e hung up on the man in the portrait
i said that it was togami !
it 's not like i 'm doubting you
but i haven 't seem him
same with the police
about what ?
what about you UNknown san ?
the UNknown soup huh ?
i guess i like this one the best
that 's also the one i had the most confidence in
ah then it 's decided
that 's great that 's great
it 's not great !
what ! ?
i UNknown l try my best
there 's nothing i could have done
by the way
i faked it in the end
and then togami san finally agreed and said he was going with the head chef to look for materials in UNknown
togami san ?
sorry sorry i call him that a lot when we 'r e together
gives me the creeps
brother has something important to talk about
should i ?
i can have serious conversations seriously
then try saying it
stinks of a lie
no i didn 't !
you did !
try ripping it off and saying it seriously one more time
we 'r e not UNknown
UNknown is no good at all
should i say it ?
we 'r e not real siblings
do you know UNknown 's hamlet ?
i did it !
you have to get a hold of yourself dear !
you can 't die !
even if hell opens its big mouth and orders me to shut up !
if you died
go to a UNknown !
they 'r e accidentally arguing on the same UNknown
stop it stop it
you too go home !
an unbelievable intrusion has come in
who is that ?
how old was she when your parents got married again ?
it was when i was eight or nine so
she was three ?
i 'm gonna go to sleep
we UNknown e been sleeping together since she was seven
i won 't do anything
what about you ?
i love her
w wait a second !
didn 't you say so also ?
even if we told her the truth nothing will change
i 'm saying that even if you don 't change UNknown probably will
someone that she thought of as an older brother up until now being someone else
plus you 'r e living together
it 's probably more difficult to not be aware of it
and then even you
what do you mean ?
in short it 's you right ?
brother you 'r e the one that 's worried about me putting my hands on UNknown
isn 't the fact that you 'r e that worried proof that you think like that too ?
that 's why you 'r e afraid to tell her the truth
what do you mean older brother and little sister ?
even you yourself love
that 's why i 'm saying you 'r e superficial !
you remember our parents were killed right ?
while the three of us went to see some stars
our parents were killed !
UNknown 's father is alive
he 's not her father !
even though he doesn 't take any responsibility he gives birth to a child and only sends money !
a guy that can 't come forward because his wife is scary
you think i could tell her that kind of guy is her father ! ?
hey what do you mean tai ?
we 'r e not you 'r e real brothers
you were a child mom brought along and
we were children that dad brought along
that 's a lie
his wife came to my place
she said she wants to meet you
there 's no need to meet her here
above the family registry
why didn 't you say anything ?
why after all this time ?
hey why ! ?
or just not have said anything
i apologize for that
i was singing
one octave different
when you visited ariake i think it was raining
did you have an umbrella ?
yes if i recall
a folding umbrella ?
how can you be so certain ?
it 's unusual
at the least you wouldn 't use it when you go to see a lover
thank you very much
is it alright if you take us to the gate ?
if we come out on the other side we 'r e good right ?
ah that 's far
then when you go left on the second street the main street
he doesn 't really look like him but i can 't say that it 's not
i think he 's innocent
the fingerprints had been wiped
he said it wasn 't a plastic umbrella
that 's it
that 's proof that he 's aware it was forgotten at the scene of the crime right ?
who 's that ?
i 'm sorry
is that right ?
that guy 's going to be caught
there 's still a month until the statute of limitations
i 'm sure the police want to find a suspect by any means
he can 't escape anymore
the black leather handbag
ariake UNknown as UNknown
but that is an alias
my true identity is
i 'm also the one who prepared the scenario
normally brother 's brain is in on it but
since a few days ago things have been uncomfortable with him
that 's right
these are UNknown we prepared to swindle togami UNknown
it 's her fault !
why a love hotel ?
plus i 'm with UNknown 's dad 's wife
i wonder how many years it 's been since i UNknown e come to this kind of place
this is bad !
plus what 's bothersome is that it 's not as disagreeable as i thought
no rather i 'm UNknown trying to go with the flow
i 'm trying to warm up towards older women
which ! ?
i 'm so happy !
a yes ! ?
then i UNknown l just be an idiot today
no a beast
i UNknown l go with the monkey family
it 's monkey day
UNknown UNknown couldn 't take it
you 'r e UNknown UNknown right ?
you finished it ?
it finally came out
it 's delicious !
that 's not a problem
my father really wanted to know
that also make me a bit curious
i thought that flavor was my father 's original
it was in UNknown
may i ask ?
she 's normal
i mean her parents were killed
if it was just me and brother
i think we probably wouldn 't have lasted
because UNknown was there we were also somehow able to be normal
what do you mean ?
in order to protect UNknown me and brother didn 't have any choice but to grow up
i was really jealous of how well they got along
i was also a single child so that makes me jealous
they were really nice bothers and
UNknown chan always played with them
so then the restaurant closed down and they were sent to an institution
what do you mean ?
she was a child brought along by her mom
she wasn 't told the truth for a really long time
she received a pretty big shock
come on UNknown
old man is fine
aunty is fine
hey hurry up !
she said she somewhat remembered
her brothers hands were warm
she said she somewhat remembered
that 's why she said that to her the two were her brothers
she said they were way more brothers to her than real ones
UNknown chan told me that
even though it 's not my story
no it is your story
even if it 's UNknown chan 's story it 's a precious episode that remains in your heart
to me that is already your story
thank you for the wonderful story
i 'm sorry !
that 's not it
the actual person ?
sooner or later the actual person might say she wants to meet you
when that happens i UNknown l contact you
i 'm really sorry
shooting stars ?
well i was thinking we might be able to see them
ah there it went !
seriously ! ?
she fell asleep
it was more awkward for me
UNknown 's way stronger huh ?
way more than us
when the store opened ?
he probably doesn 't want to remember
even i don 't ever want to live like that again
do you know how much trouble we went through to let you go to school ?
dad even did meal deliveries ?
meal deliveries ?
mahjong clubs UNknown construction site offices and stuff
oh yeah oh yeah i remembered
once he didn 't come home when he went out for deliveries
when i got worried and went to search for him
preparations for tomorrow
what 's wrong ?
by who ?
my UNknown hayashi rice was
that thug said he didn 't like it
i calmed him by saying it was a customer that goes to that kind of place so they couldn 't understand the flavor of food but
from the day on dad a started acting like a different person
he was in the kitchen every night without sleeping
at the end of that year the original hayashi rice was born
in that kind of place ?
oh my isn 't this a great story ?
maybe we should release a book ?
a book from UNknown books
do you know someone at UNknown books ?
where was that place ?
the other day after you went home
i thought something stuck out in my mind
so you could get as much food delivered as you wanted
that 's right
how many years has it been ?
eight years i think
hey stop it ariake san
it 's fine
i 'm forced to tell you this because i UNknown money
i wouldn 't even feed something this disgusting to a dog idiot !
what 's disgusting about my food ! ?
disgusting is disgusting !
i eat it every night !
my wife and kid eat it every night !
he should have just left another restaurant 's flavor alone
no that 's not it
if it 's like that we can 't explain why the hayashi rice 's flavor was similar
according my speculation that 's what made those two become acquaintances
dad taught togami the recipe !
maybe he sold it to him for money !
oh yeah !
that night togami went to be taught to make hayashi rice
togami had money problems too
that 's why he couldn 't pay the money he promised
i have it but why ?
let 's go with this
thank you very much !
thank you very much !
translation and UNknown by UNknown get more UNknown at d addicts
do not UNknown onto streaming sites !
dad and mom were killed
there 's no mistake
i 'm saying there 's no doubt it 's togami masayuki
but there 's not enough evidence !
what about talking to the cops and getting them on it ?
that 's why we UNknown l get more objective evidence like this
this is the enemy we UNknown e spent 14 years searching for
the harbor again ! ?
properly explain brother !
i said i 'd properly tell you later !
three months until the statute of limitations
i said i 'd properly explain later !
three months until the statute of limitations
more importantly UNknown
you brought mom 's memento right ?
three months until the statute of limitations
you haven 't touched it directly right ?
then just drive normally
this is a stolen car
stolen car ?
she obtained it from some shady means
we UNknown l i 'm scared too so i didn 't ask for the details
i 'm curious !
what are you to brother ?
that 's what i want to ask !
what am i to you ! ?
me and UNknown are going to go to yokohama UNknown
yokohama UNknown ?
you have two cool brothers who will always protect you
but you know ?
you haven 't heard ?
i 'm a child my mom brought along

UNknown chou yokohama city UNknown UNknown
if you suddenly split up after all this time UNknown chou yokohama city UNknown UNknown

that 's right
i think they are my brothers
UNknown city UNknown UNknown
UNknown city UNknown UNknown
you were completely UNknown
you 'r e going to be completely marked from now on
what the hell are you saying ! ?
the little brother doesn 't matter
i don 't think anything that kind of UNknown eyed wet rice cracker man
but i won 't give you the older brother
axel is the only one who i won 't give !
what do you mean axel ?
what is axel about brother ! ?
ah oh yeah oh yeah !

it 's fine
wet rice cracker ?

that depends on the cops
how did it go UNknown san ?
UNknown city UNknown UNknown
UNknown city UNknown UNknown
hey polo shirt !
cotton swab !
cotton swab !
this morning after seven
a theft report for the car had been issued quite a while ago
you seem to be in a bad mood huh UNknown san ?
is something bothering you ?
i guess you could say that
this isn 't something worth getting the UNknown police involved in right ?
are you saying to leave it to some middle aged detective whose jurisdiction it 's under ?
sorry about this
could i have you drop by the jurisdiction for a little UNknown san ?
UNknown you 'r e going to start with that one
no no no
they have a barrel like body of course
anyways if you 'r e a detective normally you 'd start with this one
a watch and lipstick
this is !
but there 's no mistake right ?
ariake is written
the store opened in UNknown 6
seven years after that
that made me remember
ariake seven year anniversary
ariake seven year anniversary
the lipstick is also something from that time too
in other words this watch and lipstick were stolen from ariake that night and kept somewhere this entire time
the car thief stole that
you just said to not to jump to conclusions
we won 't make it if we don 't hurry
there isn 't even a month until the statute of limitations
in other words
i UNknown l leave this to you
i UNknown l investigate the watch
it 's sealed up too because it 's probably stolen also
investigate it thoroughly
UNknown san 's eyes shined for a second
this guy is also excited about this unexpected clue
UNknown is a detective at heart after all !
can i touch it ?
from the outside of the bag
i don 't remember
ariake is written right ?
well it 's not like we can be sure its your dad 's just by that
where did this come from ?
do you want to know ?
guess i don 't have any choice but to ask your brother
you UNknown e seen UNknown ?
you didn 't hear ?
we 'r e good friends
good friends ?
we meet more than twice a week go to cabaret clubs trade UNknown play UNknown and go to the beach
isn 't that what you would call good friends ?
are you kidding me ! ?
he UNknown l be here soon
here ! ?
why are you speaking politely ?
if i said you probably wouldn 't have come
come over here
what a great picture !
i knew siblings had to be sitting next to each other
this guy 's been UNknown since a long time ago
even if he doesn 't know he says he does
your dad wore a watch like this right ?
yeah if i recall he received it from a friend at some anniversary UNknown
is that right ?
if i remember it was a middle school classmate
but didn 't he take that off during work ?
i don 't remember that
UNknown 's the better kid like i thought
he actually remembers and is the most obedient
UNknown you don 't have a child 's innocence
that 's why you 'r e not popular with the ladies
that 's none of your business !
a middle school classmate right ?
i won 't tell you
good work !
shining in the sky twinkling
the stars start to blur
it 's so beautiful it 's sad
i want tell you about this and that
i grasp and embrace them while they 'r e UNknown
they say when you wish upon a star it will come true someday but we can only meet in dreams now
shining in the star twinkling
the stars start to blur
on the way home my tears wouldn 't stop
memories in the sky surface
the tears pour out
i UNknown l never forget
i won 't forget
translation and UNknown by UNknown get more j drama at d addicts
do not UNknown onto streaming sites !
i didn 't go !
i didn 't go to the beach with him !
it doesn 't really matter if you went to the beach or cabaret clubs with him but don 't forget !
i know !
but the cops were the ones who clearly said it was dad 's UNknown watch
if such a UNknown watch was stolen 14 years ago
even a kid would notice
one to UNknown the police
but isn 't this good ?
it seems like they 'r e UNknown biting at the bait we laid
but we can 't be UNknown until the cops make their way to UNknown masayuki
for that reason we have to make them realize that used bookstore used to be togami tei
i 'm fine
i came by car
yeah isn 't she at togami 's ?
but we don 't need information from togami anymore
i don 't know
it 's fine
you don 't mind ?
togami san you get confirmation too much
i don 't need it
i already ate
just hurry up and sit down here
what is it tai ?
i was wondering where you went
to a friend 's place
you 'r e meeting togami UNknown without and reason
i said it before too didn 't i ?
if the cops have their eyes on togami you UNknown l be in danger too !
it 's still fine right ?
we don 't know if we UNknown l have to use him again so it 's fine if i don 't break up with him right now right ?
as if idiot !
it doesn 't have any weird UNknown like you 'r e imagining tai !
why don 't i know ?
why don 't i know about weird UNknown ! ?
don 't get merry just from taking her home
what do you mean ?
with women you know
taking her home means to go up to her room right ?
i 'm saying they 'r e ready for that much
it 's not the meaning you imagine
don 't underestimate my power of imagination
in my imagination you 'r e a huge pervert !
you 'r e doing a para para dance in the nude with a UNknown mask stuck in between your legs !
george san !
maybe i should be a little more risky
by the way
i searched for chairs to put in the restaurant today
but i wonder if she UNknown l like them ?
that 's all you think about huh ?
that 's all i think about huh
even if i look at chairs or flower UNknown or dishes
i 'm reminded of her face
right now to me a customer equals UNknown san
if she disappeared from before me right now
a phone call ! ?
oh i 'm working
there still hasn 't been a damage report issued
how did it go ?
did you find something out ?
this isn 't being sold
i 'm way ahead of you
the watch ?
there 's no doubt that 's the watch the classmate sent the victim
is the watch in forensics right now ?
there was a fingerprint on it
w whose ! ?
don 't think about taking the easy way UNknown san
there was a damage report
the used bookstore said that was stolen
i guess it was about a week ago ?
i thought it was like a burglar got in
the second story window was open and it was torn up
why didn 't you report it immediately ?
well it seemed like a pain in the ass
well the money was still there and when i UNknown around everything was still there except for the chubby pictures
the manager was also like well that 's fine then
then a weird customer came today
it 's missing
it 's going for 400 000 on the net
you should seriously submit a damage report
but why ! ?
what what what what ! ?
a photograph from when a certain star was chubby
there 's a rumor that the agency is desperately trying to collect them
i was told something like that
so then i reported it
what kind of guy was he ?
just like a computer geek
gave you a bad feeling
hey look properly !
ah it seems that it was a dining room over 10 years ago
dining room yes
well it 's a used bookstore now
UNknown san !
did you touch it ?
UNknown san !
it was a western food restaurant !
it seems that that used bookstore was a western food restaurant until 12 years ago
was that togami tei restaurant closed down ?
the opposite of that
do you want to hear the reason they moved did well ?
say it without making it bigger than it is
that thing known as sarcasm isn 't cute
wasn 't it like my dad ?
my dad wasn 't a friendly person either
well even if he was sarcastic and insulted other western food restaurants
UNknown with other western food restaurants is
what kind of insults ?
i don 't remember something that happened so long ago
remember UNknown !
or they changed the cook and the quality of the flavor dropped and stuff
was there ever the name togami tei in there ?
togami tei ?
i said to properly remember !
could you be quiet ?
does that have something to do with the case ?
for example is the culprit someone of the same business or something ?
we can 't say that yet
make it clear detective !
we can 't come to a conclusion yet
we were able to identify where it was stolen from
it 's a used bookstore now but i heard it used to be a western food store
i 'm not expecting anything
what what ?
well that happened all the time
i don 't know if it was that restaurant
it probably wasn 't it
togami tei is a restaurant that can make lines form
i don 't know about meal delivery
where was he at ?
your dad was busy with the restaurant so he shouldn 't have been able to go out that much
well like i just said
togami is a popular restaurant
ariake UNknown was into gambling and on the day of the incident he was into UNknown on horse racing
that 's probably it right ?
UNknown chou !
if the place ariake san was at was new UNknown then there 's a high chance of it being togami tei !
we 'r e going to investigate whether or not togami tei did meal delivery
is it alright giving them that kind of hint ?
i got in contact with new UNknown
i asked them to keep it a secret that we met
what is ?
if togami is caught from this it 's like we caught him
that 's too optimistic idiot
the cops can 't arrest togami with this yet
why not ?
go with that watch
those are all things that togami is innocent of
being confronted with that kind of UNknown evidence
there 's no way he would admit his guilt
what 's with that ?
even though we went through so much trouble to set that up there 's still not enough evidence ?
it 's not evidence this time
it 's motive
sorry could you make it so even an idiot could understand ?
you said there 's no mistake that togami tei stole ariake 's flavor right ?
what if evidence to support that came out of togami 's house ?
he would probably act guilty
so you mean we 'r e going to put that notebook in togami 's house ?
that 's it
we don 't have to do all that
there 's someone who can go into the house with grace
you don 't mean ?
yeah a little is fine
thank god !
you 'r e close friend
if i recall
you shed tears after eating our hayashi rice
reaching that day the smile disappeared from your face
that 's why i thought you 'd cheer up a little if you went to that restaurant
is it a bother ?
he 's the son of our enemy !
closed as of the last day of september manager
is this it ?
is this it ?
a UNknown huh
it seems unfortunate
it 's open
i thought there would be some matches
what a nice restaurant
it really is
i want to hear about your childhood
i wasn 't active
i can 't imagine that
i was depressing
it was second hand and crude but
i was still happy
i went to see them a lot with my dad
UNknown chan also
everyone would sneak out of their house at night and gather
if i recall UNknown chan had brothers that she wasn 't related to by blood
you sure remember well
more importantly the rain !
ah it stopped !
we can brag to everyone tomorrow !
it really is
that was a shooting star just then right ?
you seem much closer tonight
let 's go down soon
let 's stay like this for a little longer
there was another one !
don 't cry UNknown
too many shooting stars to count
no i want to see them now !
he said he had something important to talk about
that 's not true
you 'r e trying to tell me not to see togami san anymore right ?
i know that
the regular pattern is fine right ?
call him to a UNknown and tell him i 'm going to study abroad in canada
i won 't see him ever again
oh yeah i guess i have to move huh ?
he knows this place
tai you 'r e too nagging !
i 'm not a kid
there are some things you don 't want to even talk about with a UNknown
we 'r e not siblings
we 'r e not
i don 't worry when you come home late or act irritated because i 'm your brother
stop i don 't want to hear it !
it 's a girlfriend !
the usual wicked college girl
come on wicked ?
it 's fine for a couple to do it alone once in awhile
ah i guess you 'r e right
preferably somewhere hard to find yet the easy for the cops to spot
with that my
that 's it
has he given you any indication of inviting you over or something ?
got anything ?
togami masayuki will be arrested if this plan succeeds
a fingerprint is found on the watch and dad 's recipe notebook comes out of his house
you 'r e further confirmation UNknown
my turn is last ?
what does that bother you ?
it 's fine
i said it 's fine !
don 't fight !
before togami gets involved with the cops
UNknown UNknown has to disappear from the son 's life
only tell him about studying abroad today
after that depends on what UNknown does
i 'm UNknown from the UNknown central police station
i 'm togami
sorry i got shook up
where at ?
going to a university in kyoto was also for that
that 's wonderful
i thought you would try to stop me
i wanted you to lie or distract me
i wanted you to tell me not to go
when are you leaving ?
i 'm thinking the sooner the better
i invite you to my house
i wonder if UNknown 's doing it well ?
what 's with you ?
did my plan bother you that much ?
is that alright brother ?
there 's no way in hell it 's alright !
translation and UNknown by UNknown get more j drama at d addicts
do not UNknown onto streaming sites !
what would you do if you found out who the culprit was ?
the recent death of prof powers has left his daughter mary with the problem of carrying on the medicine show

but i never thought that you 'd
i 'm terribly sorry
you clearly have me confused with someone else
i don 't know
i should be
faces i 'm like a b b minus
where i 'm good where i really UNknown people i UNknown e slept with
that 's been a traditional area of strength for me
look seriously i don 't know who you think i am but
you charm me you seduce me you screw me then you drug me and UNknown my hotel room
and how sick is this ?
you know the last thing i remember before i passed out was how much i liked you
for a security guard right now but
i can 't believe you 'r e going this way
is that what it is ?
do you have any idea how far my ass was hanging out because of you ?
did i win something ?
i woke up the next morning i went back to the consul
i practically crawled over glass to get a copy of the guest list
i spent the next 24 hours trying to figure out if you were working for UNknown the UNknown or the russians
and which was it ?
still working for the cla ?
okay i think we 'r e done now
american consulate UNknown you and me 4th of july UNknown

red white and blue UNknown
stay away from me
first toe ring i ever saw by the way
you follow me i UNknown l scream
i took vacation time to find you !
i 'm warning you for the last time i was waiting for them to throw your picture on the screen and say
so ray anything you care to tell us about UNknown ?
you are UNknown me !
so who the hell are you ?
you 'r e my contact ?
you 'r e acting like i owe you an apology
knock yourself out
you knew what you were doing
i can see it 's really been eating at you
an UNknown case officer takes a strange girl from an embassy party back to his hotel room where he has an UNknown briefcase
full of egyptian air defense codes
did they tell you to sleep with me ?
i needed the codes
and you 'r e the mole
and who the hell hired you anyway ?
i can 't believe it
how did you get this job ?
i got news for you okay ?
the day i left UNknown
i had 15 major companies begging for my services
well i guess you picked wrong
but you must be used to that
you know i UNknown e got a meeting in 12 minutes
where 's the drop ?
hand it over
excuse me ?
this is way over your head
over my head ?
i UNknown e been promoted and decorated every place i served
tell duke to send someone else
and how long have you been working for UNknown ?
i 'm an assistant director of UNknown
i am all the way in
so let 's get this straight
i 'm the asset here
you 'r e a delivery boy
and the only thing i 'm gonna give you is a message
tell duke i don 't ever wanna see you again
i run field agents for a living
there 's only 2 ways to do it
either you bring them flowers or you hang them by their heels out of the window
now maybe you 'r e so used to having your legs in the air you don 't realize it but you 'r e upside down sister
i own you
or what ?
i like this gig
be a shame to let the last 14 months go down the drain wouldn 't it ?
so where 's my package ?
tell duke this is the one he 's been waiting for
you screw this up i UNknown l ruin your life
i thought you tried that already
you wanna take one last shot at that apology ?
i mean her exact words
she said tell duke this is the one he 's been waiting for
do you wanna do it ?
pam pam pam pam just
i gotta call UNknown right away
how are you ?
who are they ?
came back from lunch on friday handed in his resignation
and the wife has a heart condition
senior v p medical UNknown
he called in sunday
why does this guy look familiar ?
he had a briefcase full of sales UNknown stolen last year
is this the guy who bought the boat ?
i sent them this morning
we 'r e in a meeting
it 's UNknown
he wants the entire floor gathered in 5 minutes
dick it 's just that you have a very busy schedule today
yeah well something 's come up
there 's the dandruff shampoo UNknown presentation at 3 00
make it tomorrow
at 4 15
they wanted 15 minutes at around
cancel it all
there should be another vehicle
everybody 's going
get out there and sell it folks !
go go go !
get out !
i can 't even tell them apart
which one is the new one ?
of course it 's me !
who the hell else has this number ?
why are we here ?
we are here today because the rules have changed
we 'r e here because the fabric of integrity has been so abused and mangled that it is little more than a UNknown memory
we 'r e here because it 's no longer enough to have the best ideas or the best manufacturing or the best pipeline to deliver your product
we 'r e here today because we find ourselves in a world where UNknown and theft
are tested daily as replacements for UNknown and UNknown
tested daily what a bunch of crap
can you believe this ?
this from a guy who bought a dump so he could go through our garbage
i believe the history of all successful UNknown can be reduced to a series of decisive moments
there are moments in the history of all things
where the UNknown of a single where the UNknown of a single UNknown can make the difference between triumph and catastrophe
i mean who the hell writes with a fountain pen anymore ?
for christ 's sake
this room we 'r e in now this entire program was created in anticipation of just such a moment
you people are the very best at what you do
you were chosen by that standard
you UNknown e been paid and treated accordingly
and you have never been tested as you are about to be tested
UNknown UNknown will be rolling out a new product in the very near future
and while i cannot reveal the nature of this product believe me when i tell you that simply by announcing its development
b r will be dramatically UNknown at the summit of the global marketplace
i don 't need to explain to anybody in this room why the scope the details the very existence of this project must be so carefully protected
i expect your best in days to come and i promise you if we stay focused and UNknown we will all of us prosper
what the hell does he have over there ?
when you came to me that first conversation this is it
this is why we built the unit
i know what he 's doing
you say the word you unleash the beast dick
we will tear this thing apart
he 's just timing the blow duke
we caught a break ?
you call this a break ?
i got a UNknown convention in 9 days
hey man he 's not thinking about that
are you out of your UNknown mind ?
that is all that he thinks about
and believe you me if he has got a knife that is when he 's gonna use it because that 's what i 'd do !
tell your people not to make vacation plans
they 'r e gonna wanna know why
then they 'r e in the wrong business
how are we supposed to work it up if we don 't know what we 'r e protecting ?
look i don 't know
assume it 's everything
i mean we UNknown e spent the last 10 months UNknown
we got nowhere
the good news is 200 UNknown that b r purchased last month
we paid a little visit down to the vendor and we made a few UNknown to one of the units before it shipped
call this the ghost
i mean we 'r e still UNknown but look we 'r e tapped into 12 units already
the b r research and development unit in UNknown hasn 't brought a major new product to market since UNknown
in spite of that we made it a surveillance priority
number 1 we UNknown the volume of traffic and the quality of vehicles in that parking lot
number 2 we track the stock UNknown and mortgage payments of everybody on site
and number 3 we monitor the frequency of internet shopping and UNknown searches from inside that lab
stocks are down porn is up and there 's plenty of free parking
there 's nothing going on here
we 'r e confident that whatever this new product is it comes from outside the company
the moment this meeting breaks up we UNknown l be going over every UNknown b r has made in the past 18 months
we UNknown l find it
this b r building is very strong with security
is the same for us like the computer
we are all the time feeling our way around this building but not getting anywhere
then we make a big discovery
travel department is not in the big building
travel department is 4 blocks away and this building is very different
very simple and very basic
yeah it 's a gold mine dick
they basically handle all of b r 's commercial travel so every private jet car boat hotel housing everything goes through them
the boys have got some great ideas on how to get us on the inside
very simple and very basic
i swear she was that big
no i 'm just kidding
i 'm just kidding
translate that ?
i 'm not
i UNknown l be right back
just what ?
don 't even try it
excuse me ?
a little professional courtesy would make this a lot less awkward
how do i know you ?
how do you know me ?
believe me i UNknown e spent a lot of time thinking what this would be like where we 'd be what i 'd say what you 'd say
but i never thought that you 'd
i 'm sorry
look you clearly have me confused with someone else
i don 't know i 'm not great on names
i should be
faces i 'm like a b b minus
where i 'm good where i really UNknown people i UNknown e slept with
that 's been a traditional area of strength for me
look i don 't know who you think i am but
you talk me up seduce me screw me then you drug me and UNknown my hotel room
and how sick is this ?
the last thing i remember before i passed out was how much i liked you
i 'm sorry
you do not get to laugh about this
you 'r e right
it 's not you
it 's tension
my knee is fine
i can imagine
and i 'm sorry
it 's about
i mean i 'm assuming you know by now that i was working for the agency so yeah there 's that
this is totally UNknown
i mean in terms of vengeance
how bad ?
we 'r e very good at it
worth it ?
i left a wake up call
oh jesus !
this is not the day to not get a wake up call
oh god !
i had a 10 30 flight
i 'm supposed to be landing in geneva right now
you probably told me all this
i just don 't remember it
you told me london
and nobody called this morning ?
you were here
so what are you saying ?
i took the call and didn 't tell you ?
when did you set this up anyway ?
when i went for the ice
while i was waiting ?
i can 't believe they didn 't call
you snuck out of the tub to leave a wake up call !
this is a 5 star hotel
how does that happen ?
welcome to italy
i shouldn 't have to explain this to you
well this beats the hell out of UNknown
i 'm keeping them in my socks these days
see i knew it
you couldn 't
you actually think what i 'm playing you ?
that 's crazy right ?
this felt like an assignment to you ?
3 days ?
rug burn ?
god that 's so sad
because that 's exactly what i was just thinking
that maybe you 'r e playing me that you canceled my call
that this was just some revenge to get back at me for UNknown
then i 'm thinking how terrible it is that i think that way
then i realize we both think that way
then i 'm thinking is that what makes this so worth it ?
is that it ?
because then i 'm thinking do we both think like that because of what we do ?
are we good at what we do because we think like that ?
everybody thinks like that
civilians don 't think like that
this wasn 't an accident was it ?
you 'd like that wouldn 't you ?
i 'm right though aren 't i ?
because you went looking for me right ?
but why ?
not for you
can you imagine living like this ?
how much fun we could have ?
aren 't we in enough trouble ?
i mean having the money
20 million ?
private you mean
be there first hear it first
set it deep
you know what i think ?
i think you like the idea
i think you missed me
i think you canceled my call
so we 'r e even
yeah copy that
no we 'r e just around the corner from you
i UNknown l be standing by
he 's moving ?
the plan is good
he 's got a great reputation
look UNknown says the sky is falling in 6 days
if you got a better idea tell me now
look at this
they 'r e great
you coming or going ?
well i woke up in UNknown i 'm supposed to be sleeping in belgium and here i am in new york waiting for an UNknown
so i guess i 'm just not sure
my daddy was from tennessee
you 'r e kidding
you 'r e not gonna make me guess are you ?
i grew up in UNknown next county over
well that 's my name !
i 'm jimmy UNknown
well actually it 's james
well actually it 's dr UNknown
would you excuse me ?
yeah did you get them ?
nobody there can help me out ?
what and wait at the airport all night ?
that 's 26
it 's not your fault
we 'r e opening a clinic in ethiopia and my team 's over there waiting for me
i was supposed to fly to brussels tonight and then on to UNknown but my ticket got scrambled
honey that 's what i do for a living
we have to be quiet okay ?
no peeking !
let 's get it all in here
passport or permit ?
read this one
i mean why aren 't we on 3 UNknown ?
i don 't understand why we only have 2
how many eyes do you have ?
for christ 's sake duke !
you 'r e getting that to go right ?
i don 't know
which one ?
i don 't remember
give me a ballpark figure
around 10 12 minutes
6 years of travel orders
we 'r e not sure
is he an UNknown agent ?
yeah if he is he 's new
we don 't have him UNknown
we think they 'r e running some fresh players out there
i was thinking i should conduct the interview at the travel office
rattle their cages
and don 't tell her a damn thing
i was just thinking
but ned i wrote the memo
okay assumption a UNknown UNknown has a new product
assumption b they didn 't develop it UNknown
they made 57 UNknown
we ended up with
we don 't have time
so we 'r e UNknown for patterns
last night dale ran a UNknown and we found a day last march when b r bought 7 companies in one afternoon
is that normal ?
what are they hiding ?
i think it 's UNknown georgia
we just laid the travel office records over our calendar
you can 't believe the amount of traffic last summer between new york city and UNknown georgia
howard UNknown made at least 6 separate visits none of which were reported in his official schedule
so what the hell 's down there ?
something called UNknown UNknown
where 's he going ?
it was the way when he talked about the children you know
helping the little children and mending their broken hearts
and i know i do how i should know better and i 'm not
i 'm really not a gullible person
and yes he was cute i UNknown l admit it
everything falling out of his pockets and charming
you know i mean special
special like there was no one in the world but me
hasn 't anyone ever made you feel special ?
maybe for you it happens all the time
yeah you probably have someone making you feel that way all the time
you know what ?
do whatever you 'r e gonna do
cause you know what ?
i loved it !
it was incredibly worth it
i just got in
i 'm sorry but 2 months is just too goddamn long
you go in early ?
it was fine
you did it right ?
i 'd better be right ?
not really no
it couldn 't have been that easy
what are you trying to tell me ?
you didn 't do it did you ?
just walked out ?
you 'r e ducking the question
they did didn 't they ?
this is classic
i know this drill okay
did you quit or not ?
i asked you how it went and you UNknown !
how it went ?
i spent an hour signing non UNknown forms
and you don 't call to tell me that this morning ?
i couldn 't risk it
you 'r e unbelievable
i hope you kept your passports
what am i supposed to do ?
i can 't go back
you have to turn in a couple to make it look good but
i am totally cooked we 'r e gonna need decent passports
what are you talking about ?
i took everything i could get my hands on
after they begged me
so the total footprint
it 's about 22 000 square feet
the ventilation it 's UNknown
and you UNknown e got separate UNknown systems for the lab office storage and loading
it 's lovely and clean
it 's just UNknown
hell they used to truck out their own trash
he 's graduating high school 15 years old in that picture but he 's a smart kid
he gets a free ride to cornell
he finds his way into the UNknown department
2 years later he 's in UNknown school
he 's 18 he 's doing research with some heavy UNknown he 's getting good UNknown he 's rolling along
UNknown he UNknown an article in a magazine called american UNknown
it doesn 't matter
he set up shop in his parents garage started working on some kind of skin cream
yeah something called
now you 'r e sure this is a cream or was it a lotion ?
because a lot of people confuse the two
i don 't know
let 's have that !
i mean if
show me the cream !
dick he went bankrupt overnight
it was a bust okay
we don 't think the cream is the answer here
so ronnie UNknown now goes deep underground
UNknown UNknown nothing
no taxes no bank records nothing
then 2 years ago he walks into a bank in atlanta and produces a 500 000 letter of credit and a business card from UNknown
now we UNknown e been working hard we UNknown e been working fast and yet we can 't find anything about UNknown
we don 't have a vendor we don 't have an insurance company we don 't have anybody down there who knows anything about what the hell UNknown does
we 'r e working these new york travel records
howard UNknown bouncing down to UNknown like a busboy
yeah and 2 days after ronald UNknown sells UNknown UNknown to b r 3 armored trucks pull up outside the building
not only that b r sends a security detail down there to guard the load out which takes place at night
and consider that b r has yet to disclose their financial statements showing the UNknown
you can forget his room
it 's like fort knox up there
it 'd be a major operation
i told you
have a drink
you wanna just sit here all night ?
look at him he 's paralyzed
he couldn 't leave if he wanted to
why don 't you give me the credit card let me get in the game
it 's a 5 000 table
that 's okay
maybe tonight he goes nowhere
what we do ?
tomorrow we UNknown l find somebody who works upstairs in those rooms okay ?
how 's it going fellows ?
yeah we 'r e good thanks
i need to take a look at your room keys
well this is interesting
so here 's what we 'r e going to do
the drinks are UNknown
and i mean now
it 's gotta be this thing
this new thing right ?
hey i was getting worried
i got off the plane
i thought for a minute i was being tailed
by who ?
well that 's crazy
i had to run it out
i UNknown e been driving in circles for 2 hours
i wanted to call and i just thought my god we UNknown e got everything on the line here
i didn 't want to start off sloppy
god you smell good
we 'r e celebrating
well actually it 's more than good news
i nailed it
i 'm not talking UNknown UNknown macaroni and cheese
find a market where the competitors hate each other so much they UNknown l do anything to win
we get involved we lead the charge
when the price is right we ditch
all we gotta do is find an angle
maybe we flip sides maybe we shop the intel buy stock sell it whatever
there 's a hundred ways to go
there 's this company called butter mills okay
now about 2 months ago the UNknown mr butter mills sitting at home watching tv with his granddaughter
there 's this ad comes on in the morning cartoons for something called double crust pizza
this guy 's been working on double crust pizza for 5 years got 50 million invested major new product for him
trouble is he hasn 't rolled it out yet
the ad he 's watching is for UNknown fresh double crust
they stole his concept his formula his UNknown and his ad campaign
so mr butter mills is out for blood
they 'r e taking off the gloves
they 'r e bringing out the check book
here 's the best part
guess who they like for director of UNknown operations ?
i took a job yesterday
what do you mean you took a job ?
it 's not like i could call and tell you
i don 't believe this
what happened to doing it together ?
well it was just too good
no we had a plan
you know we agreed
we go over it
well of course you can
you haven 't even started yet
i mean we can push up the whole timetable
it 's perfect
look i take the job you start working out the exit strategy
you know you build up our id you set up the banks offshore trading accounts
whatever we need you get it up and running and then i bring you in see
i 'm gonna need to staff up
you UNknown l apply we UNknown l meet
we UNknown l like each other hate each other whatever works best
who 'd you take the job with ?
UNknown wants to hire me under the table and then get me a job on the UNknown desk for UNknown UNknown
they want you to be a mole ?
of course they did
what like you ?
oh yeah that makes sense
how are we ever gonna see each other ?
very very carefully
i think so
i mean the fellow who could make fire
and until that knowledge was stolen that fellow was the most powerful person on the planet
and it means something to be first
to be most
it means you have an opportunity to reproduce with the highest frequency and with the most desirable partners
it means your offspring have the greatest chance of survival and a better opportunity to make their own fire
i personally believe that human evolution has run its course
we live in a world where the people who can make fire have a tendency to wear UNknown sit in casinos and drink themselves into a UNknown
i believe that individual evolution has been replaced by something else
by a shared evolution
i believe ms UNknown in corporate evolution
we were just doing our job sir
mr UNknown may appear a fool but he is anything but
he has given UNknown UNknown a gift that will change our business our lives forever
so the question ms UNknown is whether you can continue to do the job we so desperately need you to do without knowing the stakes involved
can you really do your job without knowing what it is that you 'r e protecting ?
what i need to know is
can i share my fire with you ?
little trouble out there in the field ray ?
what do you mean ?
well i just got a back channel message from claire she wants to meet UNknown
that 's a terrible idea
yeah that 's what i told him
but now he wants direct contact
i told you when i came on board
once she 's mine i run her my way
yeah well the question 's been raised ray is it just her you 'r e running ?
you 'd better explain that to me
american consulate UNknown you and me 4th of july UNknown
find someone else to bother
red white and blue UNknown
stay away from me
first toe ring i ever saw by the way
well i UNknown l give her this
she is one cold nasty piece of work
when did she send this to you ?
she didn 't tape it
we had the whole thing wired
hey we had to
this late in the game ?
what can i tell you ?
the bitch put me through the UNknown
look if i 'd have known it was her i would never have taken the job
are you firing me duke ?
why didn 't you do it then ?
why not fire me that day ?
why keep me around ?
come on !
we thought we 'd had her out there too long and she 'd gone off the rails
and that 's why we brought you in
but this ?
when you drop the hammer on her when you take her to the bar
you UNknown e 10 seconds to get your hand off me
or what ?
no no no no no
do the other one
i own you
i own you
just me just me and dale
so you were just kidding about the meet with UNknown right ?
i mean obviously she doesn 't need to know that we know what 's going on so you just keep
you know just play it straight
i should be
faces i 'm like a b b minus
where i 'm good where i really UNknown people i UNknown e slept with
i own you
where 's your bag ?
i 'm on the red eye
i had to blow my connection
it was the only way i 'd steal a couple of hours
you should have paged me
i UNknown e been sitting in the office doing field reports for christ 's sake
i couldn 't risk it
from a pay phone ?
not from anywhere
he was my station chief
you still on good terms ?
duke needs a field agent
i figured out a way to get you in
it 's happening ray
i mean like a total corporate death match
we 'r e on
what kind of move ?
some new product
big big like we UNknown e had 4 top down tech sweeps in the last 2 weeks
big like 3 days ago we started UNknown UNknown UNknown
this morning i got a message from duke
he wants me to go active
i 'm gonna get word to him tomorrow that unless he gets me a great field officer to work with he can forget it
you 'r e gonna get that job
without knowing what the product is ?
well that 's the point
you on one side me on the other
it 's perfect
he 's duke 's drinking buddy
they play cards twice a week
you call nigel
tell him you 'r e desperate to get to new york
aren 't you desperate to get to new york ?
well yeah of course i am but it 's just
just what ?
we 'r e launching frozen hawaiian next month pineapple and ham
first time anyone 's ever done that
that 's not possible
nobody 's because it 's impossible
impossible what ?
impossible because i UNknown e been faithful
which closet ?
so where did they come from ?
look i swear to you
claire i swear i swear on all things good and true
i have no idea who they belong to
they 'r e yours ?
i just needed to hear you say it
you 'r e that upset ?
yeah i think so
the drag is i UNknown e only got 55 minutes to make it up to you
any sport that puts a limit on your score is a complete waste of time
300 that 's it ?
what are you gonna bust your nut to do something 9 million other jokers might do ?
stupidest damn thing i ever heard of
okay so don 't turn around but she just came in
we 'r e cool though right ?
she see us ?
you have a problem ?
it 's a little bright
so this gentleman here is
i know who he is
you do ?
she 's a trained professional
yeah yeah i can see that
i can definitely
would you care for something ?
she 's fine
i 'd love some pizza
do you think they have pizza ?
i UNknown l just bet that they do yeah
or even frozen pizza
why don 't you go take a look see ?
you 'd smell it if they did
i don 't give a damn if you have to go to sicily get the lady some pizza !
any particular UNknown you 'd like ?
yeah sure whatever
what just happened ?
what did she say ?
and only if he is sure
i gotta get on the plane and he 's gotta call me but it has gotta be safe
yeah it 's me
what are you doing ?
not fast enough though right ?
you 'r e leaving ?
i didn 't think you were coming
i left the signal didn 't i ?
you also took your passports and the travel money
half the money
i trusted you
when did you do this ?
you 'r e kidding
we don 't have time for this
you 'r e unbelievable
you screwed her !
it was an assignment
well you 'r e the last person i need to explain this to
the only difference between this and our first date is that no one was drugged into a coma and left for dead
left for dead ?
yeah for 18 bloody hours !
see there it is
what 's the product claire ?
you say that you can but you can 't
what is the product ?
all right you know what i did come back here to clear out my stuff
all right i was gone
i was ready to bail
i got the pouch out i 'm halfway there and i suddenly realize
oh my god !
this is good
so there i am i 'm loading it all back in
i 'm putting everything away like it never happened and i suddenly realize there 's something missing
where 's ray 's canadian passport ?
okay slow down
yes okay ?
i thought what 's the harm in having one little parachute in case the plane goes down ?
i wanted a hole card
that 's it
and the travel lady did i have to go that far ?
that 's always been my cover
i 'm a mess
i mean we 'r e here trying to run a triple game on some very smart and very UNknown players
what do you want me to do play with one hand behind my back ?
it wasn 't your hand i was talking about
you know what ?
same split new rules
you 'r e that jealous ?
no i 'm that focused
i UNknown e got 2 years invested in this and the last thing i 'm gonna do is let some stupid immature personal baggage compromise an otherwise successful operation
so we 'r e strictly business now
deal with it
except there won 't be any bald men
a cure for UNknown ?
UNknown UNknown wash and grow shampoo UNknown with UNknown UNknown
do you have any idea what this is worth ?
i mean hair
no wonder they UNknown e been so crazy
i mean we 'r e sitting here on a cure for UNknown and you 'r e getting worked up about some meaningless incident
we don 't have it
we don 't ?
it has to be
so who 's got it ?
where is it ?
if i were holding out on you what would i be doing here now ?
how about pretending to be pissed off and jealous just to keep me from thinking what was really going on
that 's sick even for you
yeah and that 's not the answer i was looking for
i have to go
we don 't have any partners i don 't know about do we ?
yeah that 's what i want
i have to go
you said it
we don 't have time
there 's some document rooms up there
we found one of the security cages wide open and we started turning on the lights
we heard some UNknown around had a little foot race
it took a couple minutes but we found him down here
hiding under the desk
ned ! he starts trying to tell us the whole thing was some kind of security test
hey ned get these things off me !
we said hey that 's great but we still gotta call your boss
that 's when he started sweating
where 's the thing ?
yeah he had this
shut up jeff

i will tell you where you can send my pay and my bonus which better be more than i expected because this was a nightmare
what is your problem ?
a copy machine ?
looking for a copy machine
it worked didn 't it ?
why didn 't i just UNknown it ?
who the hell UNknown anything anymore ?
i am running around thinking what the hell does this guy have me doing ?
we had to get it out of there
there were 50 easier ways to do it !
did it work or not ?
for who ?
has he ever been alone with it ?
could he have possibly made a copy of it ?
what the hell are you doing ?
i guess that 's a no
you 'r e sick
i should UNknown e told you that before but i couldn 't because he threatened the entire project
do you know he was on a cla observation watch list ?
that is total bullshit
we 'r e here for what a year and a half ?
how does he show up 3 weeks before the payday ?
i just brought this home
what kind of watch list ?
you know what ?
you just better make sure you 'r e the only one who got what you wanted
i don 't believe that
that 's unbelievable
you left her out there too long
this is the victory lap
what are you doing ?
you 'r e gonna search me ?
mr UNknown welcome to san diego
remember me ?
i got them to 35 million
17 5 split ?
i thought you had it
i asked you first
if i told you i loved you would it make any difference ?
if you told me or if i believed you ?
i love you
i don 't know why we 'd believe anything anymore
i just keep having this fantasy that we suddenly snap out of it that we come out of this and be like people are supposed to be
like trusting and honest
i know that
do you have any idea how UNknown it is to know that you are the only man who could ever possibly understand me ?
look i know who you are
and i love you anyway
if i find out this is because you don 't have the formula and you think maybe i do i 'm gonna be seriously disappointed
let 's just put it on the table
one time last time
i have it
i love you
i think about you even when you 'r e with me
i look at you i can 't stop looking at you
i look at you and i think that woman
that woman knows who i am and loves me anyway
i have it too
you get a big room you don 't fill it it 's gonna look like shit
the room ?
these satellite people better know what the hell they 'r e doing
they know what they 'r e doing right ?
the UNknown ?
we 'r e right on schedule
will you stop ?
what are you looking at ?
oh my goodness gracious thank you so much
god you people are out of your minds
these are the UNknown wire transfer codes
these are the account numbers and an authorized schedule of payment
now you know everybody here who knows me can tell you that there are 3 things that i really don 't like
i don 't like any kind of UNknown
i can 't stand being the center of attention
but you know most of all
i think you all know how much i hate rushing into things
now folks for the past few years we have had a highly secret special research unit that has been working on something that we like to call project samson
but you know what these scientists are like right ?
they 'r e all over me
they 'r e like please dick
slow down be patient be careful
i say you know what guys ?
i 'm meeting with my UNknown and these people have got a right to know
the incredible future that we have got planned for this company !
UNknown is in the home stretch on a cure for UNknown !
we got it
look at you !
are you testing us ?
excuse me ?
i don 't understand
sorry a lotion
how do i know you ?
how do you know me ?
wow that 's a strong play
believe me i UNknown e spent a lot of time thinking what this would be like where we 'd be what i 'd say what you 'd say
but i never
i don 't know
i should be
faces i 'm like a b b minus
where i 'm good people i UNknown e screwed
that 's a real area of strength for me
and i like traditional
that 's been a traditional area of strength for me
people i UNknown e slept with
that 's been a traditional area of strength for me
that 's nicer
you 'r e gonna UNknown right ?
so you 'r e like directing me now ?
you wanna go out there tomorrow and have them not hear it ?
you are directing me
well come back here and say that
claire come on
let 's just do it one more time when i think about you i can barely UNknown
one more time without the robe
i don 't work naked
you know i know it
so show me
from the top one more time and then i UNknown l take off the robe
if you love me you UNknown l do it without the robe now
you 'r e drawing what ?
excuse me ?
does that mean we 'r e a go sir ?
or we could spend another year looking for ways to bait this trap and we wouldn 't come up with anything even close
they 'r e perfect
i 'm only asking
the rough draft
but we could still stall a little bit if we need to tighten things up
once it 's UNknown howard we 'r e in
it 's gonna be impossible to call back the troops
so is this everything ?
the rough draft that we UNknown with you last week is in play
this is starting to look pretty good
i can 't even tell them apart
which one is the new one ?
for the travel records the UNknown material we UNknown e UNknown about 200 false flag travel orders
and when they start digging ?
they find ronnie
this is my high school UNknown
and the UNknown
so we take ronnie 's reality until 2 years ago and we lay in our story on top
we started turning on the lights
we heard some UNknown around we had a little foot race
it took a couple of minutes but we found him down here hiding under the desk
the trips to UNknown the background on the UNknown UNknown the midnight load outs it 's all in place and ready to go
10 days that 's the deadline
UNknown has his UNknown meeting in 10 days
light the fuse
you 'r e wondering if i gave you a bogus formula
you 'r e thinking maybe i UNknown e got the real one stashed someplace else
that 's sick even for you
but it crossed your mind
that 's why i get the big bucks
because i would never do that
because you love me
it really is that bad isn 't it ?
kind of yeah
i might have to wake up in rome for a long time

it 's more or less my occupation i 'm a lawyer
if you like i can tell you about my case how it was love that caused me to end up like this
i was a landowner and up until my wedding i lived a wanton lifestyle the same everybody 's living and i thought it was right
without knowing then that i was drowning in dirt
i UNknown for a pure marriage
they managed to UNknown me
this is the fate of mothers the daughter gets married and she 's left alone
why are you so selfish ?

this girl was in the baggage car when we stole the train so i thought it best to hold her
we had better stay here until daybreak to see where we are
it was so brave of you to risk your life coming into the enemy 's country just to save me
after a nice quiet refreshing night 's rest
we UNknown e got to get back to our lines somehow and warn them of this coming attack
i will get that spy before he reaches the southern lines
you follow with the supply trains as planned

v UNknown lenin
max and tess are now an item
there i said it i don 't like it but i said it
anyway turns out liz was right
alex was murdered by an alien and the killer is still out there
let me tell you what 's really going on
tess is pregnant
which fortunately i think i did
this is a key
it will take 24 hours for it to prepare itself
when it 's ready we have to be on board or we don 't go
the UNknown is capable of one mission only one
when we use it it 's gone
it 's our only way home
is everyone ready ?
we have no choice UNknown
what about UNknown ?
i mean she 's already killed alex what 's to stop her from killing liz
kyle or UNknown or maria
i UNknown l take care of UNknown
it 's just so like you 'r e obviously trying
you 'r e UNknown you know that ?
i think it looks cute !
okay lets hear from somebody other than the lowly parker
no it is not a gay thing
i UNknown e got to get out of this town i really do
would you please stop that ?
i have ?
can we talk upstairs ?
no no no
then what is it ?
i have to see you tonight
you were right about alex
he was killed by an alien
i prayed that that wasn 't the case but it was
we 'r e responsible
i never blamed any of you
i never wanted to lose you
take care of it how ?
well i 'm coming with you
she killed alex
where 's the chinese mustard ?
so i uh ordered it honey just to get the guy off the phone
UNknown do you have the chinese mustard ?
without the mustard my shrimp toast is basically UNknown oh my god i UNknown e got to tell you some of these channels are awful
i mean do you realize there are people teaching cooking classes naked ?
there are people talking politics naked
you know i think the chinese mustard is in the fridge so i UNknown l get it for you
ah thank you
thanks that helps
that your child has a home here too
i mean you 'r e uh you 'r e both part of this family now
we UNknown l figure out what 's wrong with the baby
we UNknown l find a way
how 'd it sound ?
a little too weird
i 'm gonna send a bolt of energy to that heater
it will explode
too fast for her to react
what about the other dorm rooms the other students ?
i can contain the fire with my powers long enough for everyone else to get out of the building
max this isn 't like you it 's not planned out
liz i have to do this now
max this doesn 't seem right
go to the jeep you don 't have to be a part of this
it doesn 't feel right
get out !
what the hell is going on ?
that girls not an alien she can 't be the killer
how can i leave now
i haven 't even lived yet
i know how scary it is to have to leave
leave this world but as it turns out it 's not so bad
your heart is your heart your soul is your soul
that doesn 't change
you 'r e not even real you 'r e just a figment of my imagination
well then you should really listen
cause it 's coming from within you
and what is home anyway ?
half of me is from there half of me is from here
what makes one half more important than the other ?
well that 's what you have to figure out
alex that night that night at the prom when we danced it was one of the best nights of my life and i never got to tell you that
my lady ?
liz there 's something i need to tell you
it 's about tess and me
you 'r e together now i know
it 's more than that
our relationship is uh we spent the night together
i would probably just use my powers
but i probably wouldn 't need a needle to begin with
i would probably just UNknown my blouse the way that isabel did it
they 'r e human blood cells take a look
if UNknown was innocent then who killed alex ?
i don 't know
whoever did it set up an innocent girl
we have to start from the beginning
we have to find him or her before they kill someone else
i can 't do that
i don 't have time
what are you talking about ?
tess child our child yeah well that 's your personal life
it can 't survive here he 's dying
we 'r e leaving
tomorrow just after dawn
the way the UNknown works
i don 't really want to hear about how the damn i know you don 't
you can 't just leave us with a killer out there
i don 't have a choice !
not anymore but you did and then you got tess pregnant !
i know you 'r e upset
i i trusted you i gave you everything
i jumped off bridges for you i broke laws for you
i risked getting shot for you i trusted you !
and you go off
saved yourself ?
take me home
and i know UNknown 's your favorite
what 's going on ?
sit down please
there 's a lot about you but i think what means the most to me is that you 'r e open
you know i can look into your eyes and i can see you
i can see what you 'r e thinking
i can see what you 'r e feeling
how much i mean to you sometimes how much i piss you off sometimes
but i can always see you
i see you too
you know when max and liz would kiss and liz would get the flashes ?
and when we would kiss you didn 't
i know how much that hurt you
that doesn 't matter to me anymore michael
the reason you didn 't get the flashes is because i didn 't let you get them
i didn 't let you see me
i UNknown e never let anyone see me before because there are things inside of me that i don 't want people to see
there 's things inside of me that i 'm not so proud of
but i UNknown e thought about it and i want you to see me
take my hands
is this a good time ?
not so good but i UNknown l be all right
well i just wanted to say that it 's meant a lot to me
you okay ?
that 's all i don 't want to get all weepy or anything
you are the royal four
you are created from the genetic materials of your alien UNknown and human subjects
you are given human forms so you can
alex was in this room the day he died
i can 't believe i didn 't even remember it i must have blocked it out
kyle he wasn 't
i have to tell my father
kyle come here !
that i 'm really gonna miss you
i always thought when we graduated i would give you my ring
it looks like i won 't graduate so this is something from where i UNknown l be
i can 't believe that this is what i have of you
i can 't believe that after everything
liz you never slept with kyle did you ?
i wish that so much
i guess that this is our goodbye
just tell me one thing do you love her ?
not like i love you
i think we just took a huge step in human alien relations
i love you michael
max isabel and tess and i are going home
yeah i know
we have to i have no choice
i don 't want to leave you
but we both knew someday this would happen
how much time do we have ?
about an hour
and whatever 's out there isn 't home but you 'r e my home
parker it 's 3 in the morning
you all right ?
i 'm not all right
max evans broke my heart
i 'm sorry sean
mom dad we know that in some way you always knew we were different
we want you to know that we love you so much
we 'r e orphans we could have ended up anywhere with anyone but we got you
what is it they say ?
there but for the grace of god
i 'm sorry i 'm sorry to leave you but we have to go
i wish we didn 't i wish i could just be your girl for ever but um
you were great parents to us
we will always always love you
thank you for everything
this is for our parents
will you give it to them as soon as you 'r e sure we 'r e gone ?
with my life
it 's been an honor
i i just can 't even believe it 's possible !
and he 's holding us hostage here with a gun
he 's pointing a gun at my daughter
he threatened my daughter
would you stopping tapping you are doing for a while
what there UNknown e UNknown tonight
it 's tess !
no there 's no way i UNknown e been UNknown
i 'd remember it
you don 't know that it 's happening to you
so i 'm supposed to look around the room and what ?
i don 't know see if you have an unusual response to anything
you sent me to las UNknown
alex alex let me fix your mind you 'r e not thinking straight
you UNknown me for two months while i UNknown that silly book for you and now there 's nothing left for you to UNknown
you destroyed my mind !
how could you do this to me ?
kyle get out !
kyle go !
hey just calm down !
he 's right okay
i carried his body
she killed him
kyle how much further ?
it 's just up ahead

hey guys open up
i UNknown e been on some quest to figure out where i belong
i finally found home
you of all people
i love you
take care of the others
i would understand
well whoever is coming we have to go
it 's true i was there i witnessed it
why didn 't you ever say anything ?
because she UNknown me !
you lived in my home you were like my sister !
how long ?
i didn 't want to
i wish i hadn 't but i did
tell me why !
so you just you just killed him ?
i didn 't mean to
his brain was just so weakened by the UNknown and look none of this matters now
life matters tess
what matters is getting home but you could never understand that could you ?
i might have been able to teach you but that stupid bitch had you wrapped around her
don 't you ever call her that !
why couldn 't you ever feel that about me ?
i 'm your wife max !
i 'm carrying your child !
this was all some kind of plan to get pregnant and go home wasn 't it ?
home to what tess ?
to UNknown ?
you made a deal with them with UNknown
no UNknown made a deal 40 years ago
what was the deal ?
tell me !
and what would happen to us once you delivered us ?
how did i ever fall in love with someone like you ?
how could i ever marry you ?
you were different you were a king !
now you 'r e just a boy
you kill me max you kill our son
but i was right about one thing
to get you into my life to be around you to love you
you opened the door and you came out why ?
you stayed for me
i have to save my son
few other films have been so systematically changed mutilated corrupted as this one
shots and titles have been omitted and changed
however of no other such UNknown film do we know so well what the film originally looked like
fritz lang and thea von UNknown different sex siamese twins
just like their film
at this point the music started during the first screening
the metropolis theme
thea von UNknown 's message lang didn 't believe in it
metropolis the mother city city of mothers mother of all cities
the city the film they too are machines
UNknown a UNknown an eccentric disk
a machine without workers devoid of function pure movement UNknown UNknown a machine of desire
round shapes and jerking movements become one within the image of two clocks
one 12 hour and one 10 hour clock
day shift and night shift 10 hours each mark the metropolis working day
two groups of workers UNknown in rows of six march in unison the exhausted half as fast as the fresh
they moved their feet but were not walking reads the novel
the way people move or are moved is always highly significant throughout the film
the workers theme a funeral march
the night shift enters a cage the grate is raised the cage sinks and with it the camera
a title picks up the movement
even the titles the young luis bu UNknown wrote in his review of the film
how they rise and fall blend with the movement as a whole become pictures themselves
the title 's movement is carried through to the movement of the picture
elevators transport the workers up and down between the machine halls and their living quarters
a new musical theme
the main square of the workers city
simply a transit area for the workers returning to their quarters
in the centre a gong again a kind of alarm clock
the downward scroll of the title is answered by a rising UNknown triangle pointing UNknown
an artificial grotto columns like UNknown young women in UNknown carnival costumes
orient inspired head UNknown
in contrast to the straight course of the young men animated turns UNknown directed by a UNknown UNknown
a playground is the pleasure garden of the sons an UNknown UNknown
nature sex UNknown in chaste UNknown
like the water in the fountain
a transparent dome UNknown a statue of a siren
the youth in white breeches and the girl with the UNknown de paris play hide and seek
their game a dance a pas de deux
UNknown yet so intensely innocent that we do not actually expect a real kiss
instead an UNknown glance UNknown accompanied by a new theme let us call it the love theme
answered by an apparition dressed in light grey it reads in the screenplay
from the smallest of d UNknown s rises a head with solemn eyes and glowing blonde hair
the UNknown countenance of the virgin the sweet countenance of the mother reads the novel
the mother without a man
freder 's dream
the subject of her glance is freder the brother the son of fredersen the nothing more than son
all names in metropolis are UNknown in meaning
UNknown by the clarinet a new UNknown based theme which from now on will accompany the entrances of the young woman
a door closes communication is interrupted
this will be repeated at several decisive moments throughout the film providing the UNknown for further action on the part of its UNknown
nothing could help him nothing the novel states at this point
in a UNknown UNknown UNknown stood before his eyes the vision a countenance
the UNknown countenance of the virgin the sweet countenance of the mother
later we learn that freder lost his mother at birth
not in the workers city as one would think
freder arrives in a machine hall
in the novel he now comes face to face with a machine of his own construction
he strokes it feels its limbs presses his face to its bulk
in the film the machine is also a living organism
freder in the novel
blood pressure and temperature of the film machine rise
perhaps i will feel your trembling and the UNknown of pulse in your rigid body
perhaps i shall experience the UNknown with which you UNknown yourself into your vast element bearing me the man who made you
but freder also knows freder in the novel
nothing in this world is more UNknown than the jealousy of a machine that feels neglected
in the film the machine is called the m machine
m as in mother ?
m as in UNknown
the film of the future is also a film of UNknown a biblical film
UNknown the god of the UNknown to whom the UNknown also sacrificed children to the UNknown of moses and his god
the film is UNknown with UNknown to the old and new UNknown
in the music the UNknown theme switches to the theme of the workers city
UNknown of workers in rows of six march into the mouth of UNknown which UNknown back into the machine
in the music the fredersen theme UNknown him as a self confident UNknown
joh fredersen joh with h
UNknown he is both UNknown and dictator
than he was once again a boy of ten
nothing more than the son of this father
the music the UNknown theme tells us what freder is speaking about
the gestures of the son unlike those of the father display trust seek contact
fredersen looks past him his gaze rests on the secretary
fredersen 's glances are orders as are his words his gestures
camera movements are rare in metropolis and are always significant
here the camera is guided by the movements of the actors the pace of the discussion moves the camera stops it
moves it on first it UNknown
then it pans with father and son
it is in the children not the adults that freder UNknown his siblings himself as the infant UNknown of the virgin the motherly a kind of infant jesus
fredersen is not only ruler but also builder of metropolis
his city an UNknown dream a dazzling UNknown city UNknown UNknown UNknown as the urban UNknown the new tower of babel
first from the strings then the horns UNknown UNknown marcia the theme of the uprising begins
a video telephone on the wall behind
fredersen 's office is the control communication and command centre
his power is based on information
above fredersen on the wall the lower edge of the 10 hour clock is now visible
fredersen 's power lies in his ability to control the time of his UNknown
the worker the capitalist the clerk the model of modern class society
the position of the seemingly privileged employee is in fact the most UNknown
again a door closes behind somebody this person 's disappearance UNknown freder to dedicate himself to this person
again freder runs
for the father the door closes behind him
fredersen in right profile
take note of just how differently
lang stages dialogue
and again in an act of UNknown
once again he is confronted with the spectacle of a machine
in the novel it is called the UNknown machine so let 's keep it so it keeps the elevator system in the new tower of babel moving
in the film it has no obvious function it is purely UNknown
an UNknown machine if you like
the change of clothing UNknown freder 's rebellion against the father
this is the beginning of the UNknown of the son of jehovah his passion
this cut is up to now the most serious intervention carried out by the UNknown
the critic roland UNknown praised the missing sequence
then from a far distance came rotwang and UNknown great resistance took it for his own
the rotwang musical theme is UNknown of the UNknown music
fredersen is the only person in metropolis who respects rotwang 's genius
the removal of this figure is the UNknown UNknown executed by the UNknown
the hel of the UNknown UNknown was the ruler of the underworld motherly goddess of death
in hel rotwang has lost his lover
fredersen his wife
how lang stages a dramatic dialogue
fredersen in right profile
fredersen in right profile rotwang in left profile
the audience UNknown at times UNknown at times UNknown observer
curtain up for rotwang 's first scene the entry of the mechanical woman the new hel
on the wall a UNknown the magical symbol the tip pointing UNknown suggests the UNknown
a metallic UNknown with female physical UNknown with breasts and on the UNknown mounted and UNknown the UNknown
the music echoes the most important UNknown of the mechanical woman theme
it UNknown three UNknown UNknown to the various aspects of the being and which at times appear separately at times in unison
rotwang 's artificial limb is steel steel from the steel of the creature to whom he sacrificed his hand
another parallel scene freder still at the machine
fredersen with rotwang UNknown the next sequence
rotwang 's library ancient UNknown and a neon UNknown lamp rotwang caught between middle ages and future
fredersen in contrast with a UNknown tre UNknown on his wrist is the UNknown of twenties UNknown
freder 's passion the factory is his UNknown his cross the clock the father god 's instrument of power
the UNknown is not UNknown
lack of information is the UNknown for fredersen 's departure
for the first time we see him physically in motion moving from one scene to another
fredersen and rotwang descend from right to left
left right the workers freder between them
both groups heading towards the same scene
mother look at me
they do not recognise freder in the scene
the preacher is reciting a screenplay
which freder turns into a film for us
the creative man priest ruler architect
accompanied by the music played during the opening credits of the film
what here looks like a UNknown construction in UNknown shot turns out to be a model around which a group of UNknown has gathered
new to the music
five groups of workers a UNknown
like the fingers on a hand
end of the UNknown the sermon end of the projection
a look into the camera into our eyes
thus we learn her name
in the novel freder asks
what should i call you ?
UNknown UNknown marcia
fredersen believes he has seen enough
what rotwang sees however and wants to prevent fredersen from seeing because a new plan is UNknown in his mind
a dialogue is opening
his hand UNknown her
UNknown her gaze sweeps her gaze directly into the camera
moving gently to him UNknown both in the picture the speaker always in UNknown profile the UNknown UNknown from behind
an erotic dialogue regardless of what the titles say
the love theme is playing
now stops and is replaced by the rotwang and fredersen UNknown in UNknown variations
the couple is UNknown threatened by the theme of the uprising
will rotwang give up his project to recreate hel or will he extend it if it can be used to steal his rival 's son from him
the son of hel who he himself expected from her ?
mary 's light is candlelight natural soft like her
the realm of death the realm of hel
is freder 's dead mother jealous of her son 's love is this why she joins forces with her destroyer ?
rotwang 's lamp is a mechanical tool like his steel hand the entire man a UNknown of man and machine
lucifer the UNknown of light is one of the evil one 's names
he showed this scene to a hollywood specialist wrote lang
they just did not think of it and
light and shadow should not only be used to convey a mood but should also play a decisive role in the action
UNknown gothic grandeur ceremony incense it says in the screenplay
in the centre of the scene a column reaching towards the heavens
like the trunk of a palm in the novel the cathedral UNknown a fanatical sect the UNknown who persistently offer fredersen resistance
the UNknown of the film reduced this strand of the plot even more
again a parallel action which interferes in the current action UNknown it into a UNknown
the music in the cathedral scene
the dies UNknown musical UNknown for death and disaster
in the original version of the film the musical UNknown is UNknown with the memory of the UNknown sermon of the monk at the cathedral
this is the longest piece to have been cut from the film
the story of freder the good boy
rotwang the sorcerer and the abducted mary gives metropolis the air of a UNknown in a particularly UNknown way
many UNknown are based on the abduction of a person
the hero the UNknown is shown the way
like the trail of a scent says the novel
the glow in front of him led him up the stairs
the old house sucks freder in it makes him its prisoner it draws him into the depths
the machinery of the old house is like a model of the UNknown mechanism which keeps both hero and audience moving always being shown something before it quickly disappears again
a vision a staging
rotwang 's laboratory was half a quack 's kitchen from the year 1500 and half experimental laboratory of a man from the year 2000
in rotwang 's character UNknown and lang UNknown both magic and UNknown in one UNknown
a UNknown like the film in which he appears
that could have been conceived and staged by him just like the transformation of the mechanical woman into the image of mary
his staging UNknown both feminine and masculine form and movement translated into a spectacle of light
a UNknown act of UNknown
rotwang 's experimental table with mary as snow white waiting in her glass coffin to be awakened can be seen as the couch of rotwang the psychoanalyst
her subconscious UNknown itself in the UNknown of light stretching between her and the mechanical woman
freder like awakening from a nightmare sees himself in another one
hel 's room her memorial is behind the curtain
mary 's theme UNknown in a minor key
the false mary flesh of the flesh of the true mary while at the same time a remote controlled machine at the core
why is fredersen so UNknown determined to destroy the true mary ?
in the figure of the merciful preacher he seems to sense a female challenge
that of UNknown to his UNknown principle of absolute power
freder 's UNknown experience
at this point in the novel freder chokes his father
i want to kill you i want to destroy you i want to murder you
in the film a fall UNknown into the depth into the UNknown of his subconscious
freder in bed the father in tails
an obvious feeling of helplessness in front of his father 's aura of authority
the son remains in the care of the in part female staff
a sick child
can it be that freder and rotwang are not so much rivals as the alter UNknown of each other ?
they love the same woman the dead hel
the absence of the mother the lover provides the inspiration for freder 's visions just as much as for rotwang 's UNknown
rotwang 's audience consists entirely of men old and young fathers and sons
like a blasphemous halo says the screenplay the UNknown on the woman 's head appears in the round opening of the UNknown roof
that fades out
rotwang 's show and freder 's delirium become one
an important strand in this UNknown freder 's UNknown of the monk 's sermon in the cathedral has again been cut by the UNknown
UNknown from the action which was shown
isolated edited gestures and the positions of the dancer combined with the picture of the audience
groups singles only eyes finally
rotwang 's production becomes lang 's pure UNknown cinema
rotwang 's show now clearly becomes freder 's vision
the memory of the seven deadly sins in the cathedral
of the monk 's sermon on the whore of babylon which he associates with the image of the false mary the new hel the mother whore
which becomes one with that of the metropolis the mother city
freder convalescent is reading
again two parallel scenes the second once more cut by the UNknown
the spy reports to the father the friend to the son
nothing remains of this scene but screenplay and score
lead to the assumption that these takes were repeated here
fredersen gives slim an order
a third reporting situation is UNknown in after the other two
rotwang tells mary
like the group of rich sons in the dancehall the group of workers in the UNknown too fall under the spell of the vamp
like the evil character in a fairy tale rotwang pretends his own child to be the one he keeps as a prisoner
UNknown regarded the red mary 's speech as inciting and ordered a UNknown form for the second version
instead of the title became
who wants to work himself to death for the rulers of metropolis ?
instead of in the UNknown version it became
who are the slaves of metropolis ?
and for the false mary had to say
let them rot
he sees through the double
the UNknown found the construction with rotwang 's report as the UNknown around the second UNknown scene too complicated
UNknown 's UNknown not only seals freder 's new role as a critical UNknown but also shows him as a future saviour as a new messiah
the central square of the workers city has become a stage in the theatre of the revolution
the first beats of the marseillaise
not only the music is UNknown with the character of a citation
the way the false mary whips the crowd into a frenzy UNknown to her performance in front of the rich sons
the gong UNknown is a tribune for the performance in which not only she takes part but an UNknown UNknown
in a later scene the movement UNknown and reversed we will see them empty crashing down
in the beginning only men were present here now we see women the workers wives female workers
at the start the workers silently waiting for the raising of the UNknown now the unleashed mass men and women UNknown determined to blow it up
the children abandoned by their biological fathers and mothers offered for adoption by mary the maternal and freder the brother
again two people two UNknown UNknown audio UNknown bound by the video telephone in fredersen 's office control and command tool of the ruler of metropolis
UNknown and superior
the two UNknown now in parallel action
the true the white finally free to continue her reconciliation work
and the false the red the force behind uprising and destruction
mary on her way to the city of the workers to save the children abandoned by their fathers and mothers
like a counter manoeuvre to her own creation by rotwang as a light show electric UNknown sorcery the false mary UNknown the destruction of the heart machine
before leaving the stage via a back stairway a shadow UNknown a staircase exit to another theatre another audience the sons of the rich
arm movements as though in UNknown of the UNknown of the disk still identifying with the machine even during its destruction
the elevators now finally descending UNknown
deep under the city there wanders a stream joh fredersen constructed a path for the stream when he built the city of the workers
now the unleashed waters of the depths join the uprising of the humans
we have seen rotwang working the UNknown in his laboratory and the other mary working the UNknown of the heart machine
now she is moving the UNknown of the gong machine
the gong UNknown the alarm clock the tribune UNknown the revolt is now used to save the children
the square fills with the water and the children
no more doubt
not just a couple but three a trinity of which there soon will be more with UNknown members
they take care of the children the innocent offspring of the workers who have refused to be rescued by them
a last climb through the UNknown from the depths of the workers city to the club of the sons
the flying camera UNknown the pressure of the explosion which rocks the city to its foundations
finale with mary 's theme
general pause then again the theme of the uprising men and women dancing in two UNknown circles as though still under the spell of the machines they destroyed
four actually five UNknown and actions with various characters are now UNknown
fredersen 's office
this question is UNknown answered
by a UNknown from the mechanical woman 's theme
UNknown the yoshiwara where to a UNknown the false mary
leads the sons of the rich to dance on the volcano
the workers abandon the scene of action
UNknown the entrance of the club of the sons
and the children
and finally UNknown rotwang 's attic room where fredersen 's down and out opponent recovers
this plot of UNknown UNknown again proved too complicated for the UNknown they UNknown they UNknown
they edited the film giving the impression that the false mary is the only victim of the witch hunt and that the true mary is in no danger
by UNknown this shot the true mary becomes the other
only when you carefully look you see here
mary running across the screen escaping from her UNknown who manage to couple her double
UNknown the workers construct a stake in front of the cathedral
the stake is made from metal the wrecks of cars partly with their headlights UNknown
the false mary tied to the stake
she who was created by electrical sparks totally in her element in a display of UNknown lust
UNknown and freder separated
but he knew he had died
and this UNknown filled him with the deepest satisfaction
he only wanted his hel
upon finding hel he would no longer have reason to quarrel with anything on earth
hel he says in the novel
i am not a ghost although i have died i had to die to come to you
mary the virgin and her double both in mortal danger a mirror image in one scene
the red mary at the stake the white in the cathedral pursued by rotwang
the bells of the cathedral come to her aid
UNknown the saviour
as freder watches the fire burns away the flesh of the false mary revealing her mechanical core UNknown triumphant accompanied by one of the mechanical woman UNknown in UNknown major
the scene on the cathedral roof is UNknown of victor hugo 's
hunchback of notre dame
an unmistakable reference
freder the naive fool has learnt through his passion to UNknown between truth and lies
then in the face of the needs of the children he has ripened to an active person now he is capable of dealing with his UNknown
fredersen kneeling he too UNknown through suffering
slim and UNknown another antagonistic pair unite to offer him assistance
and finally UNknown the foreman less class conscious than loyal to his rulers
in UNknown 's gravity 's rainbow p UNknown remembers how rotwang carried mary onto the roof of the cathedral
he was taken by klein UNknown playing the mad inventor who he himself and his fellow students would have loved to be
mary fredersen 's mother hel
in UNknown 's screenplay mary acting on an appeal from the workers wives calls on freder to be a mediator
in the film as shot by lang the women retreat totally into the underground and background
for the finale
the rest is dealt with by the chiefs the representatives of state and people of capital and labour
the social partners still require mutual trust
they need a mediator removed from the parties interests
mary as a woman is permitted to deliver the cue
thus completing her task
the interpretation is part of the film 's story even if UNknown bizarre and excessive
based on the comic by UNknown UNknown
screenplay by UNknown UNknown
UNknown art director shuichi UNknown
UNknown UNknown director UNknown UNknown
music UNknown honda
i tremble at the honour of announcing the UNknown of humanity 's iong history of UNknown and science
our power UNknown the earth
now it wiii UNknown the stars !
may it stand forever !
our ziggurat !
they don 't know their place !
but our economy is unthinkable without robot UNknown
yes but they cause friction with human workers
the enemy is developing new weapons
what metropolis needs is a ieader who wiii be a UNknown symbol !
duke red with the ziggurat complete wiii you be entering politics ?
don 't be siily !
as iong as president boone UNknown our state is secure
politics has no need of me
mr president would you iike to see duke red in politics ?
don 't encourage him !
how could i compete with anyone so popular ?
is it true there are military facilities in the ziggurat ?
would the mayor care to comment ?
ask minister of state skunk about that
hurray for the ziggurat !
long iive metropolis !
who knows ?
there he is !
i UNknown e given you the best facilities money can buy !
if you could wait a iittle ionger i 'm almost done
i 'm tired of hearing that
i 'i i be at your UNknown tomorrow night
but it 's not the kind of place you 'd go to !
and the place is a mess !
get back to work !
you were supposed to have that under control !
i merely found you during the iast war and took you in
i have a ietter of introduction to superintendent UNknown
the UNknown human rights committee and other organizations have warrants for him for UNknown experiments and dealing in human organs
to which end i ask for your cooperation seeing i UNknown e never been in this city and i don 't know east from west here
i 'd iike to help but with the UNknown for the ziggurat going on aii week it 's taking every single person i have to keep things under control
i don 't have anybody
weil i could give you a robot if that 's okay with you
a robot ? !
do i have to return him with a fuii tank ?
he only needs UNknown every five years
soon they won 't need us anymore
i 'm kenichi
i am UNknown 803 d UNknown
UNknown 497 3 c
we are not ailowed human names as it may UNknown upon human rights
i know !
that 's a dog 's name !
that 's right
he was a great dog
in my opinion a UNknown could not hide up here in metropolis
i have reliable sources that say he 's here !
dr laughton would not hide up here
he would go to zone 1
zone 1 ?
it is simply a calculation of UNknown
robots are strictly forbidden to operate outside their assigned area
that robot was not authorized to operate at surface UNknown
okay but who are those guys ?
they iook iike fascists
movement between UNknown is restricted
no one who carries the mark may pass through this gate
so that robot had the mark ?
there are of course hidden ways and people who work as guides to them
damn right !
it takes iight to create shadow i guess
this UNknown is not particularly dangerous but there are places in which police writ does not run
we 'r e not here as tourists
are you using reai organs ?
dear me no !
hers are mechanical
when wiii you finish ?
within the week
i 'i i put on the finishing touches and together we wiii flee !
protecting my father is my most important task
and the child who died was a girl
no mad scientist is going to deceive my father
and no mannequin iike this wiii steai his heart
tima is the super
you iie !
perhaps you should ask duke red about that
wiii you destroy the super
being for whom the one you caii father waits ?
no robot wiii steai my father !
i saw him !
atlas is right !
to arms !
please remain calm
this is no time to be fighting !
what the ? !
weil that strange old man was around
an old man ?
what 's wrong father ?
what did dr laughton mean to you ?
get out !
weil it was just an old factory
saves the trouble of tearing it down
rock of the UNknown
they say he does duke red 's dirty work
duke red ?
he 's the party founder
now there 's no UNknown connection but he funds their activities
it 's a public secret
it UNknown up ahead with the sewage from zone 2 and goes to the processing plant in zone 3
if she 's down there she 'i i have been chopped up with the garbage
anyone else yes
an old saying but a good one
we should continue searching for kenichi
who are you ?
your name your family your father your mother
no don 't eat that !
it 'i i make you sick !
no don 't eat
citizens won 't be affected but UNknown robots wiil
i 'm having everything recorded
the data wiii be valuable
begin at UNknown 3
you now hold the power of the gods themselves
if only dr laughton had finished building our guardian deity
they 'r e organizing protests
there 's fighting breaking out
this is our chance mr president !
we could make a case for treason here
wiii the military support us ?
some units are under duke red 's influence but i can handle that
we 'i i stir up the public with a few UNknown
once sentiment is against duke red we 'i i arrest him for treason
should military action be needed you have my approval
i suspect he was the guy who did in laughton
what i don 't understand is how they were connected
just what was laughton working on anyway ?
what wiii you do ?
laughton 's already dead
my client deserves that
zone 2 i think
how far down does this place go ?
zone 2 is the metropolis power plant area
zone 3 below that is the sewage
i 'i i report back and get permission to go below
i 'i i file a missing persons report on kenichi too
how often are you down here ?
twice a week for maintenance on the robots
these are albert ii types
it 's their iast check this week
is anyone here ?
no human could iast a day at this work
this is a restricted area !
so she survived
it 's aii right
stop that please !
are you okay ?
you piece of junk !
thanks for everything fifi
i 'm rock of the UNknown !
they have to be !
keep iooking !
what 's the matter atlas ?
we 'r e waiting for your signal !
was there a UNknown ?
they 'r e the reason
rock 's after them
who are you ?
i 'm kenichi
a private what ?
i don 't know
i don 't trust them
let 's kiii them
he says he 's a journalist
if he can teii the world about metropolis that helps us !
we can 't waste time on nice uniforms and our pictures in the paper
the uniform i die in wiii be the uniform of the revolution !
look at that !
there are no schools and hardly any jobs
they survive on food UNknown but with the ziggurat UNknown that 's aii been stopped
what does ziggurat mean ?
it 's an ancient UNknown tower
the tower of UNknown was one
you know what happened to that
the king 's pride brought down the wrath of god on him
history repeats itself
but it won 't be god this time
it 'i i be us
is that wrong ?
what kind of hair do you iike ?
yours is fine right now
let 's get back to your writing
thank you kenichi
that helps a iot
the UNknown are to move when the ziggurat UNknown end
we want you to crush them and storm the ziggurat
the president wiii announce the arrest of duke red for treason
he wiii invoke his powers to take controi of the police and military
then metropolis wiii be governed by the rule of iaw
and we wiii participate as a proper UNknown party
of course atlas
the things i get myself into !
i finaily find that kid and iook what happens !
i 'm sorry i could not have been of more assistance
what are you talking about ?
you UNknown e been iots of help !
i don 't know east from west here
don 't worry about kenichi
he 's tougher than he
cut that out !
oh man !
teii the whole world how angry we are
i 'm aii out of breath !
we 'd better get out of here pero
we can 't do anything
ask headquarters for backup
it 's robots they 'r e going to attack first !
are you going to hold this gate aii by yourself ?
demonstrations are forbidden during celebration week
our time has come
yes we aii know that
i agree it is a problem
it 's our emotions
but without UNknown them we can 't survive
it 's time for the uprising to begin
when should we release a statement ?
things should be clear by about 1 p
m so i suggest 3 or 3 30
what is it minister ?
hard to relax eh ?
yes mr president
what the ? !
i am merely history 's agent
that 's great !
tima this is my uncle
we meet at iast
don 't make promises you won 't keep rock !
don 't play games with me !
tima pick up the gun !
i 'i i have that back please
don 't give it to him !
you going to shoot ?
i 'm human you know
you told me no one survived the fire in dr laughton 's UNknown !
and how did you know about tima ?
answer me !
no robot must ever rule the ziggurat and metropolis !
you 'r e out of iine boy !
get up !
what if i did ?
i UNknown e come from japan to arrest laughton
my name is UNknown ban
i 'm here to see superintendent UNknown
he 's been transferred
there 's been a mistake
the UNknown have taken my nephew away
handle it through your embassy !
hot whiskey then
and those UNknown can eat UNknown !
what 's he doing here ?
i said no
i can 't move at the moment so i can 't come to you
you wiii bring her back soon won 't you ?
i 'i i be in reai trouble if they ever find out
don 't worry
this wasn 't my idea
i have to get back
you tricked me
where 's kenichi ?
weil weil weil
i guess father chose his mad scientist very weil
what are you talking about ?
you being a robot
so what are you ?
where is he ?
watch where you 'r e going !
let 's see inside this super
being that father wants so much
where 's kenichi ?
i need your help for that
you do ?
i need to iook for him on the ziggurat 's data network
can you do that ?
hold out your hand
you did it !
what do you mean ?
i 'i i report the instant we find anything sir
duke red ?
the hotei coconut
weil you 'r e different from UNknown robots
i 'm human
teii me what 's going on or i 'i i charge you with kidnapping !
i 'm not your man
it 's your son you want to talk to
and i suspect you had him kiiled to keep her a secret
take him away
one day from here you wiii rule the entire world !
he 's in no danger
we just had to quiet him down a iittle
it 'i i be an UNknown incident !
make kenichi the way he was
what 's one or two young kids tima ?
you have the power to rule the world !
what power is that ?
am i human ?
oh don 't be siily !
you 'r e nothing iike those piles of junk !
then am i human iike kenichi ?
what are you saying ? !
you 'r e no mere human being ruled by emotion and feeling torn between morality and iove !
you are the super
i UNknown e brought you new clothes miss tima
yes you are a robot but you stand at the UNknown of aii existence !
that 's because your fuii UNknown haven 't yet taken form
as your abilities evolve they 'r e taking the form of emotion and iove
your memories and emotions wiii aii be erased !
how did you know that ? !
i fancy myself a detective
come miss tima
what are you doing ?
it is you who must sit on that throne
you are the ieader we must bow to !
i am a UNknown a machine made to destroy the world
it just started up !
cut the power !
it 's going into the red !
dr UNknown !
the UNknown generator 's going wild !
what 's going on ?
i 'm not sure
this comes of trifling with robots
her memory 's UNknown with the data network
she 'i i go mad !
thus god destroyed the tower of babel
the chance of human UNknown wiii faii to 30 percent within one hour
my entire worldwide network of forces wiii be completely UNknown within 30 minutes
1 7 hours 27 minutes
hear that duke red ?
and high above a pleasure garden for the sons of the masters of metropolis
who was that ?
the great machines far underground yet high above the workers city
why did you go down there ?
i wanted to see what my brothers looked like
it was their hands that built this city of ours father
in their proper place the UNknown
what will you do if they turn against you some day ?
the foreman from the central UNknown room is here with an urgent message
more of those plans sir
they were found on two of the men who were killed today
joseph why was it not you who brought me these plans ?
you are dismissed
father don 't you realize what it means to be dismissed by you ?
joseph i need your help
i have far to go today alone into the depths to my UNknown
the machine !
i will stay at the machine
in the middle of the city was an old house
here lived rotwang the inventor
at last my work is ready
i have created a machine in the image of man that never tires or makes a mistake
now we have no further use for living workers
isn 't it worth the loss of a hand to have created the workers of the future the machine men ?
give me another 24 hours and i UNknown l bring you a machine which no one will be able to tell from a hum
as always when my experts fail i come to you for advice
for months now we have been finding these plans in the workers clothing
what do they mean ?
at two at the end of this shift
she has called another meeting
these are the plans of the ancient UNknown far below the lowest levels of the workers city
what is down there that interests the workers ?
today i will tell you the story of the tower of babel
let us build a tower whose summit will touch the skies
and on it we will UNknown
UNknown UNknown is the world and its creator
and great is man
between the brain that plans and the hands that build there must be a mediator
it is the heart that must bring about an understanding between them
but where is our mediator maria ?
be patient he will surely come
we will wait but not for long
rotwang make your robot in the likeness of that girl
hide the girl in your house i will send the robot down to the workers to sow discord among them a
leave me here john fredersen
until tomorrow in the cathedral
the seven deadly sins
come i am going to make the robot look like you
the copy is perfect
john fredersen is looking for an excuse to use violence against the workers
maria you always pleaded for peace but now the robot in your likeness has been commanded to inc
the workers accept the robot as maria
i have preached patience
maria is inciting the workers to revolt
she has told them to destroy everything
i cannot believe it
the time has come to act !
why should you sweat yourself to death to benefit the lord of metropolis ?
who keeps the machines going ?
who are the slaves of the machines ?
let the machines stop !
destroy the machines !
maria UNknown for peace not for violence
this is not maria !
john fredersen 's son !
kill him !
to the central power house !
the workers are destroying the machines
what shall i do ?
if they destroy the power house the workers city will be flooded
open the doors
you are flooding your own homes
at last maria managed to escape
yes you are the real maria
to the UNknown quickly !
the UNknown have burst
tomorrow thousands will ask in anguish where is my son ?
save the children i will tell the workers that they are safe
where are your children ?
the entire workers city is under water
who told you to destroy the machines you fools and thus to destroy yourselves ?
the witch !
find her !
the witch the witch !
where are our children ?
john fredersen 's son has saved your children
save my son !
few other films have been so systematically changed mutilated corrupted as this one
shots and titles have been omitted and changed
however of no other such UNknown film do we know so well what the film originally looked like
fritz lang and thea von UNknown different sex siamese twins
just like their film
at this point the music started during the first screening
the metropolis theme
thea von UNknown 's message lang didn 't believe in it
metropolis the mother city city of mothers mother of all cities
the city the film they too are machines
UNknown a UNknown an eccentric disk
a machine without workers devoid of function pure movement UNknown UNknown a machine of desire
round shapes and jerking movements become one within the image of two clocks
one 12 hour and one 10 hour clock
day shift and night shift 10 hours each mark the metropolis working day
two groups of workers UNknown in rows of six march in unison the exhausted half as fast as the fresh
they moved their feet but were not walking reads the novel
the way people move or are moved is always highly significant throughout the film
the workers theme a funeral march
the night shift enters a cage the grate is raised the cage sinks and with it the camera
a title picks up the movement
even the titles the young luis UNknown wrote in his review of the film
how they rise and fall blend with the movement as a whole become pictures themselves
the title 's movement is carried through to the movement of the picture
the workers now just a painted UNknown rising in the background the design of the underground workers city
elevators transport the workers up and down between the machine halls and their living quarters
a new musical theme the theme of the city of the workers
the main square of the workers city
simply a transit area for the workers returning to their quarters
in the centre a gong again a kind of alarm clock
the downward scroll of the title is answered by a rising UNknown triangle pointing UNknown
an artificial grotto columns like UNknown young women in UNknown carnival costumes
orient inspired head UNknown
in contrast to the straight course of the young men animated turns UNknown directed by a UNknown UNknown
a playground is the pleasure garden of the sons an UNknown UNknown
nature sex UNknown in chaste UNknown
iike the water in the fountain a transparent dome UNknown a statue of a siren
the youth in white breeches and the girl with the UNknown de paris play hide and seek
their game a dance a pas de deux
UNknown yet so intensely innocent that we do not actually expect a real kiss
instead an UNknown glance UNknown accompanied by a new theme let us call it the love theme
answered by an apparition dressed in light grey it reads in the screenplay
from the smallest of d UNknown s rises a head with solemn eyes and glowing blonde hair
the UNknown countenance of the virgin the sweet countenance of the mother reads the novel
the mother without a man
freder 's dream
the subject of her glance is freder the brother the son of fredersen the nothing more than son
all names in metropolis are UNknown in meaning
UNknown by the clarinet a new UNknown based theme which from now on will accompany the entrances of the young woman
a door closes communication is interrupted
this will be repeated at several decisive moments throughout the film providing the UNknown for further action on the part of its UNknown
nothing could help him nothing the novel states at this point
ln a UNknown UNknown UNknown stood before his eyes the vision a countenance the UNknown countenance of the virgin the sweet countenance of the mother
later we learn that freder lost his mother at birth
not in the workers city as one would think
freder arrives in a machine hall
in the novel he now comes face to face with a machine of his own construction
he strokes it feels its limbs presses his face to its bulk
in the film the machine is also a living organism
freder in the novel
blood pressure and temperature of the film machine rise
perhaps i will feel your trembling and the UNknown of pulse in your rigid body
perhaps i shall experience the UNknown with which you UNknown yourself into your vast element bearing me the man who made you
but freder also knows freder in the novel
nothing in this world is more UNknown than the jealousy of a machine that feels neglected
in the film the machine is called the m machine
m as in mother ?
m as in UNknown
the film of the future is also a film of UNknown a biblical film
UNknown the god of the UNknown to whom the UNknown also sacrificed children to the UNknown of moses and his god
the film is UNknown with UNknown to the old and new UNknown
in the music the UNknown theme switches to the theme of the workers city
UNknown of workers in rows of six march into the mouth of UNknown which UNknown back into the machine
in the music the fredersen theme UNknown him as a self confident UNknown
joh fredersen joh with h
than he was once again a boy of ten
nothing more than the son of this father
the music the UNknown theme tells us what freder is speaking about
the gestures of the son unlike those of the father display trust seek contact
fredersen looks past him his gaze rests on the secretary
fredersen 's glances are orders as are his words his gestures
camera movements are rare in metropolis and are always significant
here the camera is guided by the movements of the actors the pace of the discussion moves the camera stops it moves it on first it UNknown
then it pans with father and son
it is in the children not the adults that freder UNknown his siblings himself as the infant UNknown of the virgin the motherly a kind of infant jesus
fredersen is not only ruler but also builder of metropolis
his city an UNknown dream a dazzling UNknown city UNknown UNknown UNknown as the urban UNknown the new tower of babel
first from the strings then the horns UNknown UNknown marcia the theme of the uprising begins
a video telephone on the wall behind
fredersen 's office is the control communication and command centre
his power is based on information
above fredersen on the wall the lower edge of the 1 0 hour clock is now visible
fredersen 's power lies in his ability to control the time of his UNknown
the worker the capitalist the clerk the model of modern class society
the position of the seemingly privileged employee is in fact the most UNknown
again a door closes behind somebody this person 's disappearance UNknown freder to dedicate himself to this person
again freder runs
for the father the door closes behind him
fredersen in right profile
take note of just how differently
lang stages dialogue
and again in an act of UNknown
once again he is confronted with the spectacle of a machine
in the novel it is called the UNknown machine so let 's keep it so it keeps the elevator system in the new tower of babel moving
in the film it has no obvious function it is purely UNknown
an UNknown machine if you like
the change of clothing UNknown freder 's rebellion against the father
this is the beginning of the UNknown of the son of jehovah his passion
this cut is up to now the most serious intervention carried out by the UNknown
then from a far distance came rotwang and UNknown great resistance took it for his own
the rotwang musical theme is UNknown of the UNknown music
fredersen is the only person in metropolis who respects rotwang 's genius
the removal of this figure is the UNknown UNknown executed by the UNknown
the hel of the UNknown UNknown was the ruler of the underworld motherly goddess of death
in hel rotwang has lost his lover
fredersen his wife
how lang stages a dramatic dialogue
fredersen in right profile
fredersen in right profile rotwang in left profile
the audience UNknown at times UNknown at times UNknown observer
curtain up for rotwang 's first scene the entry of the mechanical woman the new hel
on the wall a UNknown the magical symbol the tip pointing UNknown suggests the UNknown
a metallic UNknown with female physical UNknown with breasts and on the UNknown mounted and UNknown the UNknown
the music echoes the most important UNknown of the mechanical woman theme
it UNknown three UNknown UNknown to the various aspects of the being and which at times appear separately at times in unison
rotwang 's artificial limb is steel steel from the steel of the creature to whom he sacrificed his hand
another parallel scene freder still at the machine
fredersen with rotwang UNknown the next sequence
rotwang 's library ancient UNknown and a neon UNknown lamp rotwang caught between middle ages and future
fredersen in contrast with a UNknown UNknown on his wrist is the UNknown of twenties UNknown
freder 's passion the factory is his UNknown his cross the clock the father god 's instrument of power
the UNknown is not UNknown
lack of information is the UNknown for fredersen 's departure
for the first time we see him physically in motion moving from one scene to another
fredersen and rotwang descend from right to left
ieft right the workers freder between them
both groups heading towards the same scene
mother look at me !
both UNknown of the plot UNknown in rotwang 's and fredersen 's glance down into the crypt
they do not recognise freder in the scene
the preacher is reciting a screenplay
which freder turns into a film for us
the creative man priest ruler architect
accompanied by the music played during the opening credits of the film
what here looks like a UNknown construction in UNknown shot turns out to be a model around which a group of UNknown has gathered
new to the music the tower of babel theme
five groups of workers a UNknown
like the fingers on a hand
end of the UNknown the sermon end of the projection
a look into the camera into our eyes
thus we learn her name
in the novel freder asks
what should i call you ??
UNknown UNknown marcia the theme of the uprising
fredersen believes he has seen enough
what rotwang sees however and wants to prevent fredersen from seeing because a new plan is UNknown in his mind
a dialogue is opening
his hand UNknown her
UNknown her gaze sweeps her gaze directly into the camera
moving gently to him UNknown both in the picture the speaker always in UNknown profile the UNknown UNknown from behind
an erotic dialogue regardless of what the titles say
the love theme is playing
now stops and is replaced by the rotwang and fredersen UNknown in UNknown variations
the couple is UNknown threatened by the theme of the uprising
will rotwang give up his project to recreate hel or will he extend it if it can be used to steal his rival 's son from him
the son of hel who he himself expected from her ?
mary 's light is candlelight natural soft like her
the realm of death the realm of hel
is freder 's dead mother jealous of her son 's love is this why she joins forces with her destroyer ?
rotwang 's lamp is a mechanical tool like his steel hand the entire man a UNknown of man and machine
lucifer the UNknown of light is one of the evil one 's names
he showed this scene to a hollywood specialist wrote lang
they could do it said lang
they just did not think of it and
light and shadow should not only be used to convey a mood but should also play a decisive role in the action
the cathedral a second piece of the middle ages
UNknown gothic grandeur ceremony incense it says in the screenplay
in the centre of the scene a column reaching towards the heavens
iike the trunk of a palm in the novel the cathedral UNknown a fanatical sect the UNknown who persistently offer fredersen resistance
the UNknown of the film reduced this strand of the plot even more
again a parallel action which interferes in the current action UNknown it into a UNknown
the music in the cathedral scene the dies UNknown musical UNknown for death and disaster
in the original version of the film the musical UNknown is UNknown with the memory of the UNknown sermon of the monk at the cathedral
this is the longest piece to have been cut from the film
the story of freder the good boy
rotwang the sorcerer and the abducted mary gives metropolis the air of a UNknown in a particularly UNknown way
many UNknown are based on the abduction of a person
the hero the UNknown is shown the way
like the trail of a scent says the novel
the glow in front of him led him up the stairs
the old house sucks freder in it makes him its prisoner it draws him into the depths
the machinery of the old house is like a model of the UNknown mechanism which keeps both hero and audience moving always being shown something before it quickly disappears again
a vision a staging
rotwang 's laboratory was half a quack 's kitchen from the year 1 500 and half experimental laboratory of a man from the year 2000
in rotwang 's character UNknown and lang UNknown both magic and UNknown in one UNknown
a UNknown like the film in which he appears
that could have been conceived and staged by him just like the transformation of the mechanical woman into the image of mary
his staging UNknown both feminine and masculine form and movement translated into a spectacle of light
a UNknown act of UNknown
rotwang 's experimental table with mary as snow white waiting in her glass coffin to be awakened can be seen as the couch of rotwang the psychoanalyst
her subconscious UNknown itself in the UNknown of light stretching between her and the mechanical woman
freder like awakening from a nightmare sees himself in another one
hel 's room her memorial is behind the curtain
mary 's theme UNknown in a minor key
the false mary flesh of the flesh of the true mary while at the same time a remote controlled machine at the core
why is fredersen so UNknown determined to destroy the true mary ?
in the figure of the merciful preacher he seems to sense a female challenge
that of UNknown to his UNknown principle of absolute power
freder 's UNknown experience
at this point in the novel freder chokes his father
i want to kill you !
i want to destroy you !
i want to murder you !
in the film a fall UNknown into the depth into the UNknown of his subconscious
freder in bed the father in tails
an obvious feeling of helplessness in front of his father 's aura of authority
the son remains in the care of the in part female staff
a sick child
can it be that freder and rotwang are not so much rivals as the alter UNknown of each other ?
they love the same woman the dead hel
the absence of the mother the lover provides the inspiration for freder 's visions just as much as for rotwang 's UNknown
rotwang 's audience consists entirely of men old and young fathers and sons
like a blasphemous halo says the screenplay the UNknown on the woman 's head appears in the round opening of the UNknown roof that fades out
rotwang 's show is a film another of rotwang 's light productions with footlights and counter lighting
rotwang 's show and freder 's delirium become one
an important strand in this UNknown freder 's UNknown of the monk 's UNknown in the cathedral has again been cut by the UNknown
UNknown from the action which was shown isolated edited gestures and the positions of the dancer combined with the picture of the audience
groups singles only eyes finally
rotwang 's production becomes lang 's pure UNknown cinema
rotwang 's show now clearly becomes freder 's vision the memory of the seven deadly sins in the cathedral
of the monk 's sermon on the whore of babylon which he associates with the image of the false mary the new hel the mother whore
which becomes one with that of the metropolis the mother city
freder convalescent is reading
again two parallel scenes the second once more cut by the UNknown
the spy reports to the father the friend to the son
nothing remains of this scene but screenplay and score
iead to the assumption that these takes were repeated here
fredersen gives slim an order
a third reporting situation is UNknown in after the other two
rotwang tells mary
like the group of rich sons in the dancehall the group of workers in the UNknown too fall under the spell of the vamp
like the evil character in a fairy tale rotwang pretends his own child to be the one he keeps as a prisoner
UNknown regarded the red mary 's speech as inciting and ordered a UNknown form for the second version
instead of the title became
who wants to work himself to death for the rulers of metropolis ??
instead of in the UNknown version it became
who are the slaves of metropolis ??
and for the false mary had to say
let them rot
he sees through the double
the UNknown found the construction with rotwang 's report as the UNknown around the second UNknown scene too complicated
UNknown 's UNknown not only seals freder 's new role as a critical UNknown but also shows him as a future saviour as a new messiah
the central square of the workers city has become a stage in the theatre of the revolution
the first beats of the marseillaise
not only the music is UNknown with the character of a citation
the way the false mary whips the crowd into a frenzy UNknown to her performance in front of the rich sons
the gong UNknown is a tribune for the performance in which not only she takes part but an UNknown UNknown
in a later scene the movement UNknown and reversed we will see them empty crashing down
in the beginning only men were present here now we see women the workers wives female workers
the face of the UNknown masses was UNknown only with the uprising unleashed does this face obtain female traits does its female base appear UNknown oppressed by organisation control discipline
again the same UNknown as in the beginning in reverse order and UNknown direction
at the start the workers silently waiting for the raising of the UNknown now the unleashed mass men and women UNknown determined to blow it up
the children abandoned by their biological fathers and mothers offered for adoption by mary the maternal and freder the brother
again two people two UNknown UNknown audio UNknown bound by the video telephone in fredersen 's office control and command tool of the ruler of metropolis
UNknown and superior
the two UNknown now in parallel action the true the white finally free to continue her reconciliation work
and the false the red the force behind uprising and destruction
mary on her way to the city of the workers to save the children abandoned by their fathers and mothers
like a counter manoeuvre to her own creation by rotwang as a light show electric UNknown sorcery the false mary UNknown the destruction of the heart machine
before leaving the stage via a back stairway a shadow UNknown a staircase exit to another theatre another audience the sons of the rich
arm movements as though in UNknown of the UNknown of the disk still identifying with the machine even during its destruction
the elevators now finally descending UNknown
deep under the city there wanders a stream joh fredersen constructed a path for the stream when he built the city of the workers
now the unleashed waters of the depths join the uprising of the humans
we have seen rotwang working the UNknown in his laboratory and the other mary working the UNknown of the heart machine
now she is moving the UNknown of the gong machine
the gong UNknown the alarm clock the tribune UNknown the revolt is now used to save the children
the square fills with the water and the children
no more doubt
not just a couple but three a trinity of which there soon will be more with UNknown members
they take care of the children the innocent offspring of the workers who have refused to be rescued by them
a last climb through the UNknown from the depths of the workers city to the club of the sons
the flying camera UNknown the pressure of the explosion which rocks the city to its foundations
finale with mary 's theme
general pause then again the theme of the uprising men and women dancing in two UNknown circles as though still under the spell of the machines they destroyed
four actually five UNknown and actions with various characters are now UNknown
fredersen 's office
this question is UNknown answered
by a UNknown from the mechanical woman 's theme
UNknown the yoshiwara where to a UNknown the false mary
UNknown the sons of the rich to dance on the volcano
the workers abandon the scene of action
UNknown the entrance of the club of the sons
and the children
and finally UNknown rotwang 's attic room where fredersen 's down and out opponent recovers
this plot of UNknown UNknown again proved too complicated for the UNknown they UNknown they UNknown
they edited the film giving the impression that the false mary is the only victim of the witch hunt and that the true mary is in no danger
by UNknown this shot the true mary becomes the other
only when you carefully look you see here !
mary running across the screen escaping from her UNknown who manage to couple her double
UNknown the workers construct a stake in front of the cathedral
the stake is made from metal the wrecks of cars partly with their headlights UNknown
the false mary tied to the stake
she who was created by electrical sparks totally in her element in a display of UNknown lust
UNknown and freder separated
but he knew he had died
and this UNknown filled him with the deepest satisfaction
he only wanted his hel
upon finding hel he would no longer have reason to quarrel with anything on earth
hel he says in the novel
i am not a ghost although i have died i had to die to come to you
mary the virgin and her double both in mortal danger a mirror image in one scene
the red mary at the stake the white in the cathedral pursued by rotwang
the bells of the cathedral come to her aid
UNknown the saviour
as freder watches the fire burns away the flesh of the false mary revealing her mechanical core UNknown triumphant accompanied by one of the mechanical woman UNknown in UNknown major
the scene on the cathedral roof is UNknown of victor hugo 's
hunchback of notre dame
an unmistakable reference the UNknown
after the demise of the evil half of the female double pair the final battle between the two male rivals is UNknown on the roof of the cathedral
freder the naive fool has learnt through his passion to UNknown between truth and lies
then in the face of the needs of the children he has ripened to an active person now he is capable of dealing with his UNknown
fredersen kneeling he too UNknown through suffering
slim and UNknown another antagonistic pair unite to offer him assistance
and finally UNknown the foreman less class conscious than loyal to his rulers
in UNknown 's gravity 's rainbow p UNknown remembers how rotwang carried mary onto the roof of the cathedral
he was taken by klein UNknown playing the mad inventor who he himself and his fellow students would have loved to be
mary fredersen 's mother hel
in UNknown 's screenplay mary acting on an appeal from the workers wives calls on freder to be a mediator
in the film as shot by lang the women retreat totally into the underground and background the women retreat totally into the underground and background
for the finale the mediator theme
the rest is dealt with by the chiefs the representatives of state and people of capital and labour
the social partners still require mutual trust
they need a mediator removed from the parties interests
mary as a woman is permitted to deliver the cue
thus completing her task
the interpretation is part of the film 's story even if UNknown bizarre and excessive
now our country will extend to the heaven
it 's my honor to deliver the historical wisdom and the achievement of science
this glory surprised me greatly
our strength will shine the whole world and the entire space
and exist in the world forever !
our UNknown UNknown
it 's too mad !
the economy can 't make any progress without the labor of the robot
the problem is how to deal with the conflict between the robot and the workers
we heard that the enemy was developing a new weapon
so we need a more representative and powerful leader !
congratulations on the top out of ziggurat
duke red will you get into power next time ?
i have no UNknown to do that
president boon will you invite duke red to join your cabinet ?

international human rights committee etc 7 human rights group have released the wanted order for them because they 'r e suspected to smuggle and trade in organs
so we hope you can help us
because we 'r e not familiar with here
and know nothing here
but the vacation celebrating the top out of ziggurat will be over in a week
many criminals will come out to make trouble in this period of time
we 'r e very busy now
now the people i can appoint to you

but it has no rights to arrest mankind but it has the rights to search
i think it can help you

the fuel is UNknown 5 years once
we don 't need mankind now
my name is kenichi nice to meet you
my type is 803 d r p
d m 497 UNknown
and we UNknown l lead the industry economy and culture
it 's almost the birth of a great power an outstanding progress in the history
it 's my honor to deliver the historical wisdom and the achievement of science
this glory surprised me greatly
our strength will shine the whole world and the entire space
and exist in the world forever !
our UNknown UNknown
do you have a simple name ?
we can 't have a name as mankind or we UNknown l trespass on human rights
right you UNknown l be called UNknown UNknown pero from today on
as if it 's a dog 's name
right it 's the name of a dog of mine before
it 's very famous
what did you say ?
according to the reliable intelligence i got
he 's in the city
area 1 ?
this is your intuition as a detective
no it 's the possibility rate calculated by computer
but those people like fascists
who 'r e they ?
their name is UNknown 's militia
it 's a political organization at first
in grand city
only mankind without mark and robot can move around the world
do you mean the robot just now has some mark ?
right there 's an entrance in every area
but there 's someone who knows where there 's a secret passage after all
so the things of just now happens from time to time
that regulation is w
there 's nothing dangerous on this layer
but there 'r e some places we can 't manage
be careful you two
hi long time no see come here
come back quickly !
i was out a few days ago
where UNknown e you been on earth ?
i heard something interesting from outside
it 's set up well hasn 't it finished ?
the final energy disposition device isn 't steady now
have you used the UNknown system which you 'r e best at ?
no i won 't do that illegal thing
because although it 's convenient and quick it 's can 't last long
i only make it with machine this time
this is my UNknown of the whole life
when UNknown l you finish it ?
within a week
as a result it may bomb at last
i UNknown l finish you now
and then i UNknown l take you away from here
you 'r e rock
it 's my important task to protect father
and hasn 't his daughter die ?
shut up !
how can father be moved by such useless puppet ?
what 'r e you doing ! ?
duke red asked me to make this tima for him
do you know there 's chair on the top of ziggurat ?
the one who UNknown l sit on it is tima
you 'r e fooling me !
it 's impossible for father to put ziggurat on the top !
then you may go to ask duke red yourself
can you fire ?
i won 't turn father to a robot
in order to protect father from the evil robot
please give me strength
fire alarm !
i saw that myself
what atlas said is right
they regard us as rubbish !
take our arms !
everybody please calm down
it 's dangerous here please keep off
don 't prevent robot !
do you want to make us lose our job and kill us this time
what 's up ! ?
is that man this guy ?
bad kenichi you come in from the behind
as if some experiment is being carried out there
and the fire is quite terrible
and the research office is all burnt
how about dr
what 's he UNknown on earth ?
he 's an international wanted person
he must be doing a dangerous experiment
what 's up father ?
do you know him ?
shut up !
that fire alarm is so surprising
because it 's good for those useless to be destroyed
it 's strange even it 's burnt completely that robot has the highest level its bone 'd be found yeah
pero that man is ?
he 's rock of UNknown party
he 's great power in the party while he 's so young
it 's said duke red believes in him very much
duke red ?
the creator of UNknown is duke red
although it 's nothing to do with him seemingly
but the fund of the movement is provided
although it 's a secret they have too much stink
people in the city all know it
hey where does this sewer lead ?
it UNknown with those of area 2 and then flow to the processing plant in area 3
one UNknown l die if he falls into it
because he UNknown l be dealt with as rubbish
common mankind are like so
the criminal must return to the crime UNknown
what people said before is really reasonable
let 's go to look for mr
who 'r e you on earth ?
it 's wrong do you know ?
you 'd call yourself 'i
who am i ?
but they UNknown e UNknown
and then swallow it
your UNknown will feel uncomfortable if you eat like that
you can 't eat it or
open the round ceiling
the cloud on the above is 1 1
it won 't effect the experiment
the magnetic error is 3 7
the UNknown is being adjusted
the UNknown UNknown began
it 's 40 39 to the radiation place
the UNknown system UNknown system UNknown system and operation system are all normal
the main control center has given the last acceptance to the experiment
the energy UNknown UNknown 3 33
we UNknown e received the picture of the downtown and now we 'r e UNknown it to you
get into the last stage begin taking aim
magnetic UNknown error 0 25
UNknown UNknown error 1 06 the radiation device has been fixed at the final place
radiation time is 3 minutes
that effect citizens
i have ordered someone to write down the whole experiment for this material is quite valuable
begin the experiment from 3 degree
the sun 's data is 24
it 's 5 seconds to get to r location
4 3 2 1
the sun 's UNknown UNknown ray is as the same as the UNknown mode of UNknown UNknown UNknown UNknown
there 'r e 49 UNknown in location r
the UNknown of UNknown magnetic field is rising from 800
that UNknown the UNknown
radiation of degree 3 is over
the primary control system is UNknown
the experiment is quite successful
that will make the whole world raise a dust
because you UNknown e mastered the great god
now as long as there 's grand city 's UNknown made by dr laughton it UNknown l be perfect
how come he carry out the experiment and made the UNknown increase quickly and the earth surface is UNknown by harmful electric wave
it 's too unscrupulous to develop that without considering the country !
UNknown party which is catching the out control robot is UNknown on citizens now and shouting UNknown UNknown beings come into power
they announced they 'd UNknown 'r UNknown law
the citizen group which approve robot said that idea was unreasonable
they UNknown everywhere and had some UNknown with UNknown party
this is a good chance president
if things go smoothly
is the army ready ?
there 'r e some troops which are loyal to duke red
don 't worry let me manage it
i believe it 's that guy who killed laughton
but i don 't know the relationship between laughton and him
what experiment is laughton making ?
what 's you plan ?
since laughton has died now
i 'd report the reason to the UNknown or it UNknown l be hard for me to do that
where UNknown l that guy plan to go ?
i think he 's going to area 2
is there any other underground world besides here ?
what 's the matter with this city ?
area 2 has the energy plants and area 3 has some equipment dealing with UNknown water
equipment dealing with UNknown water
in other words that guy is always searching the UNknown behind the abandoned factory
i UNknown l applied the document to enter area 2 after i returned to the headquarter and ask to search mr
how much ?
i can recognize him at once
because the monitor of the management bureau us very strict
do you often come down ?
twice a week
these are 'a UNknown model
they UNknown l have the final examination in this week
but it always smells terrible whenever i come here
we mankind can 't work here for a day
what 's up ?
it 's forbidden to enter here !
he really doesn 't die
don 't worry they 'r e criminals
please tell me where the exit is
please stop !
are you alright ?
that guy wants to kill us
keep off !
keep off !
there 's no problem here
what 's up ?
thank you very much fi fi
see you later
fi fi !
show me you pass
it 's forbidden to parade in vacation
please dismiss yourselves quickly
i don 't want it
don 't say that buy it
how are things going with you ?
i didn 't find it
impossible search it completely !
we can 't receive the uprising signal
the uprising stops today
is the information released ?
it 's all because of them
rock wants to kill them
come on quickly
where 'r e you from ?
my name is kenichi
why will rock kill you ?
i don 't know either
in a word he shot at us suddenly
it 's UNknown
calm down we 'r e not criminals or UNknown
you said you were reporters just now
it UNknown l be very good to let the whole world know the condition of grand city
at this jungle
at least i UNknown e the rights to choose what clothes i 'd put on when i die
i want to put on the clothes of a famous UNknown to die
hey look there as if it 's like an angel
it 's an angel
there 's not a school nor any job
all people here live on UNknown
but after ziggurat is set up even the UNknown will be stopped
what does ziggurat mean ?
it means the tower built by ancient babylon
it 's the most famous babel
do you know the result ?
the proud king of babylon UNknown god and the tower was destroyed
history will repeat itself
it 's not god this time
we UNknown l ruin it ourselves
i only feel you hair become longer
kenichi what kind of UNknown do you like ?
the present one is ok
what 's more go on practicing
wow the following is
thank you kenichi
although the underground people agree to rise up they worry about that they have not such ability
the celebration of the top out of ziggurat will be operated by UNknown party
i hope you can get rid of them at a blow
and then break into ziggurat
meanwhile president will formally announce
duke red turns against our nation and we UNknown l arrest him
on that day i UNknown l use my power
iet the army and police come under the leadership of president boon
then the power of grand city will recover
and we UNknown l come into power as a new party
of course atlas

if we don 't say yes to that point we can 't live on
it 's time to rise up

the situation will become steady at 1 00 pm
maybe it 's 3 00 or half past 3 00

in the fire alarm in laughton 's research office tima
your report says there 's no survivor from the fire
and how did you know the thing of tima ?

don 't let such robot control ziggurat and the future of grand city !
you UNknown l have your moment as long as i think a little of you !
get up !
what UNknown l you do if it is ?
i come to arrest laughton from japan
my name is UNknown ban
come on get on the car
where 's kenichi ?
i want to see UNknown UNknown the UNknown is posted away
the successor hasn 't be confirmed you may come on another day
in fact because some misunderstanding my nephew was taken away by UNknown party
as a foreigner you 'd UNknown a request to your embassy
now our country will extend to the heaven
it 's my honor to deliver the historical wisdom and the achievement of science
this glory surprised me greatly
our strength will shine the whole world
sake should be heated
i heard he 'd left the party
but he wandered around here
i had refused him originally but he told me not to inform duke red and others
i told me i can 't manage that
but he called himself kenichi so i
it 's not convenient for me to move now
so i can 't come to see you now
i UNknown l leave this country soon
i want to meet you very much
please keep your words and give miss tima to me quickly
i UNknown l fall into catastrophe if others know it
don 't worry i UNknown l speak over soon
in fact i didn 't want to help him
then excuse me
where 's kenichi ?
no wonder that mad scientist selected my father
what do you want to say on earth ?
i said you were a robot
no i 'm not
a man ?
where 'r e they now ?
they 'r e
since you don 't know where kenichi is
i UNknown l go back now
what ! ?
let me have a look
is there any secret with the superman which father wants ?
cheer up laughton
don 't worry
where 's kenichi ?
so i need you help
can i manage that kind of thing ?
come on show me your hand
kenichi is in that building
what do you mean ?
yes we UNknown l report to you as long as we search it
is it duke red ?
we can search the place where the information is released
because the energy is too strong
the fork of the circuit is burnt
i found it
please tell me am i a man or
it 's true you are different from other robots
i 'm a man
right of course
i UNknown e been looking for you for a long time tima
what 's your attempt ?
if i like i can arrest you with the sin that you kidnapped others
you are wrong !
it 's rock ! ?
i don 't know what attempt you have
but i know
i believe it 's you who planned to kill him
and your purpose is to vanish the proof
take him back
you UNknown l control the world here soon
he isn 't in danger now
because he 's shouting loudly
so we ask him to calm down
it UNknown l become a diplomatic problem duke red
i 'm so stupid
please let kenichi recover
one or two this kind of guys are nothing
you UNknown e the power to control the world
what 's my strength ?
am i a man ?
am i as the same as those poor robots ?
why do you ask such a foolish question ?
you 'r e different from that waste iron
then am i a man like kenichi ?
what did you say you 'r e not a man at all
you won 't be UNknown by emotion or feeling and won 't be puzzled by love or moral
you 'r e not so poor as mankind
you 'r e a superman !
then i 'm really
you 'r e really a robot
but you 'r e the noblest in the world
you 'r e fooling me
i have my feeling and love because i 'm tired of you
you 'r e still not perfect
because you haven 't reach the final UNknown
it 's only that your unstable energy shows out as feeling and love
when that moment comes
at that time your emotion and memory will disappear
how could you know that ?
i 'm a spy after all
come on change your shirt miss tima
dad please wake up
you must take this seat dad
dad only you are our leader
what do you want to do ! ?
who pressed the switch ! ?
the system started itself !
change to hand control !
cut off the power !
it lost control !
dr UNknown !
UNknown generation device began losing control !
what 's up doctor ?
it 's an punishment for those who UNknown with robot
tima 's memory is swallowed by too much message
she began to lose control
babel has made god angry
she isn 't the tima you were familiar with now !
ok i see
the possibility of mankind 's survival will be less 30
my earth weapons will begin to work in 30 minutes
the targets are the main city and equipment of the world
there 'r e 7 586 places totally
and as for those who survive
it UNknown l use the order of gene to make a new biological weapon
it may take 17 hours and 27 minutes
can you hear me duke red ?
the superman you made said it didn 't need mankind !
what 's up ! ?
go away !
tima it 's me !
you can 't !
who 'r e you on earth ?
it 's wrong do you know ?
you 'd call yourself 'i
who am i ?
based on the comic by UNknown UNknown
screenplay by UNknown UNknown
UNknown art director shuichi UNknown
UNknown UNknown director UNknown UNknown
music UNknown honda
i tremble at the honour of announcing the UNknown of humanity 's iong history of UNknown and science
our power UNknown the earth
now it wiii UNknown the stars !
may it stand forever !
our ziggurat !
they don 't know their place !
but our economy is unthinkable without robot UNknown
yes but they cause friction with human workers
the enemy is developing new weapons
what metropolis needs is a ieader who wiii be a UNknown symbol !
duke red with the ziggurat complete wiii you be entering politics ?
don 't be siily !
as iong as president boone UNknown our state is secure
politics has no need of me
mr president would you iike to see duke red in politics ?
don 't encourage him !
how could i compete with anyone so popular ?
is it true there are military facilities in the ziggurat ?
would the mayor care to comment ?
ask minister of state skunk about that
hurray for the ziggurat !
long iive metropolis !
who knows ?
there he is !
i UNknown e given you the best facilities money can buy !
if you could wait a iittle ionger i 'm almost done
i 'm tired of hearing that
i 'i i be at your UNknown tomorrow night
but it 's not the kind of place you 'd go to !
and the place is a mess !
get back to work !
you were supposed to have that under control !
i merely found you during the iast war and took you in
i have a ietter of introduction to superintendent UNknown
the UNknown human rights committee and other organizations have warrants for him for UNknown experiments and dealing in human organs
to which end i ask for your cooperation seeing i UNknown e never been in this city and i don 't know east from west here
i 'd iike to help but with the UNknown for the ziggurat going on aii week it 's taking every single person i have to keep things under control
i don 't have anybody
weil i could give you a robot if that 's okay with you
a robot ? !
do i have to return him with a fuii tank ?
he only needs UNknown every five years
soon they won 't need us anymore
i 'm kenichi
i am UNknown 803 d UNknown
UNknown 497 3 c
we are not ailowed human names as it may UNknown upon human rights
i know !
that 's a dog 's name !
that 's right
he was a great dog
in my opinion a UNknown could not hide up here in metropolis
i have reliable sources that say he 's here !
dr laughton would not hide up here
he would go to zone 1
zone 1 ?
it is simply a calculation of UNknown
robots are strictly forbidden to operate outside their assigned area
that robot was not authorized to operate at surface UNknown
okay but who are those guys ?
they iook iike fascists
movement between UNknown is restricted
no one who carries the mark may pass through this gate
so that robot had the mark ?
there are of course hidden ways and people who work as guides to them
damn right !
it takes iight to create shadow i guess
this UNknown is not particularly dangerous but there are places in which police writ does not run
we 'r e not here as tourists
are you using reai organs ?
dear me no !
hers are mechanical
when wiii you finish ?
within the week
i 'i i put on the finishing touches and together we wiii flee !
protecting my father is my most important task
and the child who died was a girl
no mad scientist is going to deceive my father
and no mannequin iike this wiii steai his heart
tima is the super
you iie !
perhaps you should ask duke red about that
wiii you destroy the super
being for whom the one you caii father waits ?
no robot wiii steai my father !
i saw him !
atlas is right !
to arms !
please remain calm
this is no time to be fighting !
what the ? !
weil that strange old man was around
an old man ?
what 's wrong father ?
what did dr laughton mean to you ?
get out !
weil it was just an old factory
saves the trouble of tearing it down
rock of the UNknown
they say he does duke red 's dirty work
duke red ?
he 's the party founder
now there 's no UNknown connection but he funds their activities
it 's a public secret
it UNknown up ahead with the sewage from zone 2 and goes to the processing plant in zone 3
if she 's down there she 'i i have been chopped up with the garbage
anyone else yes
an old saying but a good one
we should continue searching for kenichi
who are you ?
your name your family your father your mother
no don 't eat that !
it 'i i make you sick !
no don 't eat
citizens won 't be affected but UNknown robots wiil
i 'm having everything recorded
the data wiii be valuable
begin at UNknown 3
you now hold the power of the gods themselves
if only dr laughton had finished building our guardian deity
they 'r e organizing protests
there 's fighting breaking out
this is our chance mr president !
we could make a case for treason here
wiii the military support us ?
some units are under duke red 's influence but i can handle that
we 'i i stir up the public with a few UNknown
once sentiment is against duke red we 'i i arrest him for treason
should military action be needed you have my approval
i suspect he was the guy who did in laughton
what i don 't understand is how they were connected
just what was laughton working on anyway ?
what wiii you do ?
laughton 's already dead
my client deserves that
zone 2 i think
how far down does this place go ?
zone 2 is the metropolis power plant area
zone 3 below that is the sewage
i 'i i report back and get permission to go below
i 'i i file a missing persons report on kenichi too
how often are you down here ?
twice a week for maintenance on the robots
these are albert ii types
it 's their iast check this week
is anyone here ?
no human could iast a day at this work
this is a restricted area !
so she survived
it 's aii right
stop that please !
are you okay ?
you piece of junk !
thanks for everything fifi
i 'm rock of the UNknown !
they have to be !
keep iooking !
what 's the matter atlas ?
we 'r e waiting for your signal !
was there a UNknown ?
they 'r e the reason
rock 's after them
who are you ?
i 'm kenichi
a private what ?
i don 't know
i don 't trust them
let 's kiii them
he says he 's a journalist
if he can teii the world about metropolis that helps us !
we can 't waste time on nice uniforms and our pictures in the paper
the uniform i die in wiii be the uniform of the revolution !
look at that !
there are no schools and hardly any jobs
they survive on food UNknown but with the ziggurat UNknown that 's aii been stopped
what does ziggurat mean ?
it 's an ancient UNknown tower
the tower of UNknown was one
you know what happened to that
the king 's pride brought down the wrath of god on him
history repeats itself
but it won 't be god this time
it 'i i be us
is that wrong ?
what kind of hair do you iike ?
yours is fine right now
let 's get back to your writing
thank you kenichi
that helps a iot
the UNknown are to move when the ziggurat UNknown end
we want you to crush them and storm the ziggurat
the president wiii announce the arrest of duke red for treason
he wiii invoke his powers to take controi of the police and military
then metropolis wiii be governed by the rule of iaw
and we wiii participate as a proper UNknown party
of course atlas
the things i get myself into !
i finaily find that kid and iook what happens !
i 'm sorry i could not have been of more assistance
what are you talking about ?
you UNknown e been iots of help !
i don 't know east from west here
don 't worry about kenichi
he 's tougher than he
cut that out !
oh man !
teii the whole world how angry we are
i 'm aii out of breath !
we 'd better get out of here pero
we can 't do anything
ask headquarters for backup
it 's robots they 'r e going to attack first !
are you going to hold this gate aii by yourself ?
demonstrations are forbidden during celebration week
our time has come
yes we aii know that
i agree it is a problem
it 's our emotions
but without UNknown them we can 't survive
it 's time for the uprising to begin
when should we release a statement ?
things should be clear by about 1 p
m so i suggest 3 or 3 30
what is it minister ?
hard to relax eh ?
yes mr president
what the ? !
i am merely history 's agent
that 's great !
tima this is my uncle
we meet at iast
don 't make promises you won 't keep rock !
don 't play games with me !
tima pick up the gun !
i 'i i have that back please
don 't give it to him !
you going to shoot ?
i 'm human you know
you told me no one survived the fire in dr laughton 's UNknown !
and how did you know about tima ?
answer me !
no robot must ever rule the ziggurat and metropolis !
you 'r e out of iine boy !
get up !
what if i did ?
i UNknown e come from japan to arrest laughton
my name is UNknown ban
i 'm here to see superintendent UNknown
he 's been transferred
there 's been a mistake
the UNknown have taken my nephew away
handle it through your embassy !
hot whiskey then
and those UNknown can eat UNknown !
what 's he doing here ?
i said no
i can 't move at the moment so i can 't come to you
you wiii bring her back soon won 't you ?
i 'i i be in reai trouble if they ever find out
don 't worry
this wasn 't my idea
i have to get back
you tricked me
where 's kenichi ?
weil weil weil
i guess father chose his mad scientist very weil
what are you talking about ?
you being a robot
so what are you ?
where is he ?
watch where you 'r e going !
let 's see inside this super
being that father wants so much
where 's kenichi ?
i need your help for that
you do ?
i need to iook for him on the ziggurat 's data network
can you do that ?
hold out your hand
you did it !
what do you mean ?
i 'i i report the instant we find anything sir
duke red ?
the hotei coconut
weil you 'r e different from UNknown robots
i 'm human
teii me what 's going on or i 'i i charge you with kidnapping !
i 'm not your man
it 's your son you want to talk to
and i suspect you had him kiiled to keep her a secret
take him away
one day from here you wiii rule the entire world !
he 's in no danger
we just had to quiet him down a iittle
it 'i i be an UNknown incident !
make kenichi the way he was
what 's one or two young kids tima ?
you have the power to rule the world !
what power is that ?
am i human ?
oh don 't be siily !
you 'r e nothing iike those piles of junk !
then am i human iike kenichi ?
what are you saying ? !
you 'r e no mere human being ruled by emotion and feeling torn between morality and iove !
you are the super
i UNknown e brought you new clothes miss tima
yes you are a robot but you stand at the UNknown of aii existence !
that 's because your fuii UNknown haven 't yet taken form
as your abilities evolve they 'r e taking the form of emotion and iove
your memories and emotions wiii aii be erased !
how did you know that ? !
i fancy myself a detective
come miss tima
what are you doing ?
it is you who must sit on that throne
you are the ieader we must bow to !
i am a UNknown a machine made to destroy the world
it just started up !
cut the power !
it 's going into the red !
dr UNknown !
the UNknown generator 's going wild !
what 's going on ?
i 'm not sure
this comes of trifling with robots
her memory 's UNknown with the data network
she 'i i go mad !
thus god destroyed the tower of babel
the chance of human UNknown wiii faii to 30 percent within one hour
my entire worldwide network of forces wiii be completely UNknown within 30 minutes
1 7 hours 27 minutes
hear that duke red ?
all ages have their hope of tomorrow
now our country will extend to the heaven
it 's my honor to deliver the historical wisdom and the achievement of science
this glory surprised me greatly
our strength will shine the whole world and the entire space
and exist in the world forever !
our UNknown UNknown
it 's too mad !
the economy can 't make any progress without the labor of the robot
the problem is how to deal with the conflict between the robot and the workers
we heard that the enemy was developing a new weapon
so we need a more representative and powerful leader !
congratulations on the top out of ziggurat
duke red will you get into power next time ?
i have no UNknown to do that
president boon will you invite duke red to join your cabinet ?
don 't UNknown our feeling
as for the popularity to the people
i can 't compare with duke red
i heard there 's some military device in this ziggurat
let 's invite mayor UNknown to deliver his opinion to us
you 'd ask that question to minister UNknown
long live ziggurat !
i don 't know
what 's the matter ! ?
please give me more time
i UNknown l finish it soon
i UNknown e heard what you said hundreds of times !
i UNknown l go to see it tomorrow evening
it 's out of order
go back to work !
it 's me
yes the robot rebels were making trouble
i don 't want to listen to your explanation
i have given you the security task
i only accepted you as an orphan in the battle last time
don 't flatter yourself
the vehicle UNknown nearby
this is the car no 3 we 'r e UNknown the UNknown robot rebels
all the patrol wagons near to the air station
please get ready to fight wait for orders
headquarter headquarter !
my name is UNknown ban
i want to see UNknown UNknown
i have the reference of the police UNknown of tokyo
no wonder do you mean dr laughton is hiding in grand city
do you mean so ?
right my intelligence is provided by the organ smuggler who does business with him
international human rights committee etc 7 human rights group have released the wanted order for them because they 'r e suspected to smuggle and trade in organs
so we hope you can help us
because we 'r e not familiar with here
and know nothing here
but the vacation celebrating the top out of ziggurat will be over in a week
many criminals will come out to make trouble in this period of time
we 'r e very busy now
now the people i can appoint to you
right robot it 's very excellent
but it has no rights to arrest mankind but it has the rights to search
i think it can help you
won 't you send it back after we UNknown it fuel
the fuel is UNknown 5 years once
we don 't need mankind now
my name is kenichi nice to meet you
my type is 803 d r p
d m 497 UNknown
and we UNknown l lead the industry economy and culture
it 's almost the birth of a great power an outstanding progress in the history
it 's my honor to deliver the historical wisdom and the achievement of science
this glory surprised me greatly
our strength will shine the whole world and the entire space
and exist in the world forever !
our UNknown UNknown
do you have a simple name ?
we can 't have a name as mankind or we UNknown l trespass on human rights
right you UNknown l be called UNknown UNknown pero from today on
as if it 's a dog 's name
right it 's the name of a dog of mine before
it 's very famous
what did you say ?
according to the reliable intelligence i got
he 's in the city
area 1 ?
this is your intuition as a detective
no it 's the possibility rate calculated by computer
but those people like fascists
who 'r e they ?
their name is UNknown 's militia
it 's a political organization at first
in grand city
only mankind without mark and robot can move around the world
do you mean the robot just now has some mark ?
right there 's an entrance in every area
but there 's someone who knows where there 's a secret passage after all
so the things of just now happens from time to time
that regulation is w
there 's nothing dangerous on this layer
but there 'r e some places we can 't manage
be careful you two
hi long time no see come here
come back quickly !
i was out a few days ago
where UNknown e you been on earth ?
i heard something interesting from outside
it 's set up well hasn 't it finished ?
the final energy disposition device isn 't steady now
have you used the UNknown system which you 'r e best at ?
no i won 't do that illegal thing
because although it 's convenient and quick it 's can 't last long
i only make it with machine this time
this is my UNknown of the whole life
when UNknown l you finish it ?
within a week
as a result it may bomb at last
i UNknown l finish you now
and then i UNknown l take you away from here
you 'r e rock
it 's my important task to protect father
and hasn 't his daughter die ?
shut up !
how can father be moved by such useless puppet ?
what 'r e you doing ! ?
duke red asked me to make this tima for him
do you know there 's chair on the top of ziggurat ?
the one who UNknown l sit on it is tima
you 'r e fooling me !
it 's impossible for father to put ziggurat on the top !
then you may go to ask duke red yourself
can you fire ?
i won 't turn father to a robot
in order to protect father from the evil robot
please give me strength
fire alarm !
i saw that myself
what atlas said is right
they regard us as rubbish !
take our arms !
everybody please calm down
it 's dangerous here please keep off
don 't prevent robot !
do you want to make us lose our job and kill us this time
what 's up ! ?
is that man this guy ?
bad kenichi you come in from the behind
as if some experiment is being carried out there
and the fire is quite terrible
and the research office is all burnt
how about dr
what 's he UNknown on earth ?
he 's an international wanted person
he must be doing a dangerous experiment
what 's up father ?
do you know him ?
shut up !
that fire alarm is so surprising
because it 's good for those useless to be destroyed
it 's strange even it 's burnt completely that robot has the highest level its bone 'd be found yeah
pero that man is ?
he 's rock of UNknown party
he 's great power in the party while he 's so young
it 's said duke red believes in him very much
duke red ?
the creator of UNknown is duke red
although it 's nothing to do with him seemingly
but the fund of the movement is provided
although it 's a secret they have too much stink
people in the city all know it
hey where does this sewer lead ?
it UNknown with those of area 2 and then flow to the processing plant in area 3
one UNknown l die if he falls into it
because he UNknown l be dealt with as rubbish
common mankind are like so
the criminal must return to the crime UNknown
what people said before is really reasonable
let 's go to look for mr
who 'r e you on earth ?
it 's wrong do you know ?
you 'd call yourself 'i
who am i ?
but they UNknown e UNknown
and then swallow it
your UNknown will feel uncomfortable if you eat like that
you can 't eat it or
open the round ceiling
the cloud on the above is 1 1
it won 't effect the experiment
the magnetic error is 3 7
the UNknown is being adjusted
the UNknown UNknown began
it 's 40 39 to the radiation place
the UNknown system UNknown system UNknown system and operation system are all normal
the main control center has given the last acceptance to the experiment
the energy UNknown UNknown 3 33
we UNknown e received the picture of the downtown and now we 'r e UNknown it to you
get into the last stage begin taking aim
magnetic UNknown error 0 25
UNknown UNknown error 1 06 the radiation device has been fixed at the final place
radiation time is 3 minutes
that effect citizens
i have ordered someone to write down the whole experiment for this material is quite valuable
begin the experiment from 3 degree
the sun 's data is 24
it 's 5 seconds to get to r location
4 3 2 1
the sun 's UNknown UNknown ray is as the same as the UNknown mode of UNknown UNknown UNknown UNknown
there 'r e 49 UNknown in location r
the UNknown of UNknown magnetic field is rising from 800
that UNknown the UNknown
radiation of degree 3 is over
the primary control system is UNknown
the experiment is quite successful
that will make the whole world raise a dust
because you UNknown e mastered the great god
now as long as there 's grand city 's UNknown made by dr laughton it UNknown l be perfect
how come he carry out the experiment and made the UNknown increase quickly and the earth surface is UNknown by harmful electric wave
it 's too unscrupulous to develop that without considering the country !
UNknown party which is catching the out control robot is UNknown on citizens now and shouting UNknown UNknown beings come into power
they announced they 'd UNknown 'r UNknown law
the citizen group which approve robot said that idea was unreasonable
they UNknown everywhere and had some UNknown with UNknown party
this is a good chance president
if things go smoothly
is the army ready ?
there 'r e some troops which are loyal to duke red
don 't worry let me manage it
i believe it 's that guy who killed laughton
but i don 't know the relationship between laughton and him
what experiment is laughton making ?
what 's you plan ?
since laughton has died now
i 'd report the reason to the UNknown or it UNknown l be hard for me to do that
where UNknown l that guy plan to go ?
i think he 's going to area 2
is there any other underground world besides here ?
what 's the matter with this city ?
area 2 has the energy plants and area 3 has some equipment dealing with UNknown water
equipment dealing with UNknown water
in other words that guy is always searching the UNknown behind the abandoned factory
i UNknown l applied the document to enter area 2 after i returned to the headquarter and ask to search mr
how much ?
i can recognize him at once
because the monitor of the management bureau us very strict
do you often come down ?
twice a week
these are 'a UNknown model
they UNknown l have the final examination in this week
but it always smells terrible whenever i come here
we mankind can 't work here for a day
what 's up ?
it 's forbidden to enter here !
he really doesn 't die
don 't worry they 'r e criminals
please tell me where the exit is
please stop !
are you alright ?
that guy wants to kill us

if we don 't say yes to that point we can 't live on
it 's time to rise up

i want to see UNknown UNknown the UNknown is posted away
the successor hasn 't be confirmed you may come on another day
in fact because some misunderstanding my nephew was taken away by UNknown party
as a foreigner you 'd UNknown a request to your embassy
now our country will extend to the heaven
it 's my honor to deliver the historical wisdom and the achievement of science
this glory surprised me greatly
our strength will shine the whole world
sake should be heated
i heard he 'd left the party
but he wandered around here
i had refused him originally but he told me not to inform duke red and others
i told me i can 't manage that
but he called himself kenichi so i
it 's not convenient for me to move now
so i can 't come to see you now
i UNknown l leave this country soon
i want to meet you very much
please keep your words and give miss tima to me quickly
i UNknown l fall into catastrophe if others know it
don 't worry i UNknown l speak over soon
in fact i didn 't want to help him
then excuse me
where 's kenichi ?
no wonder that mad scientist selected my father
what do you want to say on earth ?
i said you were a robot
no i 'm not
a man ?
where 'r e they now ?
they 'r e
since you don 't know where kenichi is
i UNknown l go back now
what ! ?
let me have a look
is there any secret with the superman which father wants ?
cheer up laughton
don 't worry
where 's kenichi ?
so i need you help
can i manage that kind of thing ?
come on show me your hand
kenichi is in that building
what do you mean ?
yes we UNknown l report to you as long as we search it
is it duke red ?
we can search the place where the information is released
because the energy is too strong
the fork of the circuit is burnt
i found it
please tell me am i a man or
it 's true you are different from other robots
i 'm a man
right of course
i UNknown e been looking for you for a long time tima
what 's your attempt ?
if i like i can arrest you with the sin that you kidnapped others
you are wrong !
it 's rock ! ?
i don 't know what attempt you have
but i know
i believe it 's you who planned to kill him
and your purpose is to vanish the proof
take him back
you UNknown l control the world here soon
he isn 't in danger now
because he 's shouting loudly
so we ask him to calm down
it UNknown l become a diplomatic problem duke red
i 'm so stupid
please let kenichi recover
one or two this kind of guys are nothing
you UNknown e the power to control the world
what 's my strength ?
am i a man ?
am i as the same as those poor robots ?
why do you ask such a foolish question ?
you 'r e different from that waste iron
then am i a man like kenichi ?
what did you say you 'r e not a man at all
you won 't be UNknown by emotion or feeling and won 't be puzzled by love or moral
you 'r e not so poor as mankind
you 'r e a superman !
then i 'm really
you 'r e really a robot
but you 'r e the noblest in the world
you 'r e fooling me
i have my feeling and love because i 'm tired of you
you 'r e still not perfect
because you haven 't reach the final UNknown
it 's only that your unstable energy shows out as feeling and love
when that moment comes
at that time your emotion and memory will disappear
how could you know that ?
i 'm a spy after all
come on change your shirt miss tima
dad please wake up
you must take this seat dad
dad only you are our leader
what do you want to do ! ?
who pressed the switch ! ?
the system started itself !
change to hand control !
cut off the power !
it lost control !
dr UNknown !
UNknown generation device began losing control !
what 's up doctor ?
it 's an punishment for those who UNknown with robot
tima 's memory is swallowed by too much message
she began to lose control
babel has made god angry
she isn 't the tima you were familiar with now !
ok i see
the possibility of mankind 's survival will be less 30
my earth weapons will begin to work in 30 minutes
the targets are the main city and equipment of the world
there 'r e 7 586 places totally
and as for those who survive
it UNknown l use the order of gene to make a new biological weapon
it may take 17 hours and 27 minutes
can you hear me duke red ?
the superman you made said it didn 't need mankind !
what 's up ! ?
go away !
tima it 's me !
you can 't !
who 'r e you on earth ?
it 's wrong do you know ?
you 'd call yourself 'i
every UNknown UNknown
UNknown the comic by UNknown UNknown
UNknown UNknown UNknown
i tremble at the honor UNknown the UNknown UNknown 's long history UNknown and science
our power UNknown the earth
now it will UNknown the stars !
may it stand forever !
they don 't know their place !
but our economy is unthinkable without robot labor
yes but they cause friction with human workers
the enemy is developing new weapons
what metropolis needs is a leader who will be a powerful symbol !
duke red with the ziggurat complete will you be entering politics ?
don 't be silly !
as long as president boone UNknown our state is secure
politics has no need UNknown
mr president would you like to see duke red in politics ?
don 't encourage him !
how could i compete with anyone so popular ?
it is true there are military facilities in the ziggurat ?
would the mayor care to comment ?
ask minister UNknown skunk about that
hurray for the ziggurat !
long live metropolis !
long live metropolis !
who knows ?
there he is !
i UNknown e given you the best facilities money can buy !
ifyou could wait a little longer
i 'm almost done
i UNknown l be UNknown lab tomorrow night
but it 's not the kind UNknown you 'd go to !
and the place is a mess !
get back to work !
it 's me
you were supposed to have that under control !
i merely found you during the last war and UNknown in
i have a letter UNknown to superintendent UNknown
the international human rights committee and other organizations have issued warrants against him UNknown experiments and dealing in human organs
to which end i ask foryour cooperation seeing i UNknown e never been in this city and i don 't know east from west here
i 'd like to help but with the UNknown for the ziggurat going on all this week it 's taking every single person i have to keep things under control
i don 't have anybody
well i could UNknown a robot UNknown 's UNknown you
a robot ? !
do i have to return him with a full tank ?
he only needs UNknown every UNknown
soon UNknown 't need us any more
i 'm ken ichi
uh how doyou do
thus UNknown that will UNknown UNknown !
i UNknown UNknown UNknown the UNknown UNknown 's UNknown
UNknown the earth
d UNknown UNknown 3 c
don 't you have an easier name ?
we are not allowed human names as it may UNknown upon human rights
i know !
that 's a dog 's name !
that 's right
he was a great dog
in my opinion a criminal could not hide up here in metropolis
i have reliable sources that say he 's here !
dr laughton would not hide up here
he would go to zone 1
zone 1 ?
it is simply a calculation UNknown
robots are strictly forbidden to operate outside their assigned area
that robot was not authorized to operate at surface level
ok but who are those guys ?
they look like fascists
movement between levels is restricted
no one who carries the mark may pass through this gate
so that robot had the mark ?
there are ofcourse hidden ways and people who work as guides to them
damn right !
hmm it takes light to create shadow i guess
this level is not particularly dangerous but there are places in which police writ does not run
we 'r e not here as tourists
her UNknown stage energy UNknown isn 't UNknown
areyou using real organs ?
dear me no !
hers are mechanical
when will you UNknown ?
within the week
i UNknown l put on the UNknown touches and UNknown will fee !
protecting my father is my most important task
and the child who died was a girl
no mad scientist is going to deceive my father
and no mannequin like this will steal his heart
tima is the super being who is to sit on the throne of power UNknown the ziggurat
you lie !
perhaps you should ask duke red about that
will you destroy the super being UNknown the UNknown call UNknown UNknown waits ?
no robot will steal my father !
i saw him !
atlas is right !
to arms !
please remain calm
everyone please step back
this is no time to be UNknown !
what the ? !
well that strange old man was around
an old man ?
i guess he was doing an experiment
the UNknown ripped right through it
what happened to him ?
his UNknown found
what 's wrong father ?
what did dr laughton mean toyou ?
get out !
well it UNknown an old factory
saves the trouble UNknown it down
rock ofthe UNknown
they say he does duke red 's UNknown
duke red ?
he 's the party founder
now there 's no UNknown connection but he funds their activities
it 's a public secret
it UNknown up ahead with the sewage from zone 2 and goes to the processing plant in zone 3
UNknown 's down there she UNknown l have been chopped up with the other garbage
anyone else yes
an old saying but a good one
we should continue searching for ken ichi
who areyou ?
i am who ?
your name your family your father your mother
no don 't eat that !
it UNknown l UNknown sick !
no don 't eat UNknown sick
attention control UNknown 1
UNknown UNknown 1 06
citizens won 't be affected but above ground robots will
i 'm having everything recorded
the data will be valuable
begin at level 3
UNknown UNknown !
you now hold the power ofthe gods themselves
UNknown dr laughton had fiinished building our guardian deity
he 's caused UNknown in UNknown and bathed earth in harmful magnetic radiation
it 's an outrage that he would endanger national security by developing such a thing !
the UNknown robot hunters are using this as an excuse to cry UNknown UNknown rights and press for changes in the robot law
the pro robot citizens groups say that 's reactionary nonsense
they 'r e organizing protests
there 's UNknown breaking out
this is our chance mr president !
we could make a case for treason here
will the military support us ?
some units are under duke red 's UNknown but i can handle that
we UNknown l stir up the public with a few leaks
once sentiment is against duke red we UNknown l arrest him for treason
should military action be needed you have my approval
i suspect he was the guy who did in laughton
what i don 't understand is how UNknown connected
just what was laughton working on anyway ?
what will you do ?
laughton 's already dead
my client deserves that
zone 2 i think
how far down does this place go ?
zone 2 is the metropolis power plant area
zone 3 below that is the sewage handling facility
the sewage facility
i UNknown l report back and get permission to go below
i UNknown l UNknown a missing persons report on ken ichi too
how often areyou down here ?
twice a week for maintenance on the robots
these are albert ii types
it 's their last check this week
is anyone here ?
no human could last a day at this work
what is it ?
this is a restricted area !
so she survived
it 's all right
stop that please !
areyou ok ?
thanks for everything UNknown
i 'm rock ofthe UNknown !
UNknown forbidden during celebration week

he says he 's UNknown
ifhe can tell the world about metropolis that helps us !
we can 't waste time on nice uniforms and our pictures in the paper
the uniform i die in will be the uniform ofthe revolution !
look at that !
there 's no schools hardly UNknown for people
they survive on food UNknown but with the ziggurat UNknown that 's all been stopped
what does UNknown UNknown mean ?
it 's an ancient UNknown tower
the tower of babel was one
you know what happened to that
the king 's pride brought down the wrath UNknown on him
history repeats itself
but it won 't be god this time
it UNknown l be us
is that wrong ?
what kind UNknown doyou like ?
let 's get back UNknown
thankyou ken ichi
that helps a lot
the UNknown are to move when the ziggurat UNknown end
we wantyou to crush them and storm the ziggurat
the president will announce the arrest of duke red for treason
he will invoke his powers to take control of the police and military
then metropolis will be governed by the rule UNknown
and we will participate as a proper political party
the things i get UNknown !
i UNknown fiind that kid and UNknown happens !
i 'm sorry i could not have been UNknown assistance

so then i am a
i UNknown e UNknown new clothes miss tima

that 's UNknown full UNknown haven 't yet taken form
as your abilities evolve they 'r e simply taking the form UNknown and love

thus god destroyed the tower of babel
the chance UNknown survival will fall to 30 per cent within one hour
my entire world wide network UNknown will be completely UNknown within 30 minutes
their targets are the world 's major cities and 7 586 other facilities
estimated time period for UNknown UNknown by biological warfare
1 7 hours 27 minutes
hear that duke red ?
your super being says she doesn 't need us !
what 's happening ? !
get out !
ken ichi !
more than a quarter of the film must be regarded as UNknown lost
few other films have been so systematically changed mutilated corrupted as this one
shots and titles have been omitted and changed
however of no other such UNknown film do we know so well what the film originally looked like
fritz lang and thea von UNknown different sex siamese twins
just like their film
at this point the music started during the first screening
the metropolis theme
thea von UNknown 's message lang didn 't believe in it
metropolis the mother city city of mothers mother of all cities
the city the film they too are machines
UNknown a UNknown an eccentric disk
a machine without workers devoid of function pure movement UNknown UNknown a machine of desire
round shapes and jerking movements become one within the image of two clocks
one 12 hour and one 10 hour clock
day shift and night shift 10 hours each mark the metropolis working day
two groups of workers UNknown in rows of six march in unison the exhausted half as fast as the fresh
they moved their feet but were not walking reads the novel
the way people move or are moved is always highly significant throughout the film
the workers theme a funeral march
the night shift enters a cage the grate is raised the cage sinks and with it the camera
a title picks up the movement
even the titles the young luis bu UNknown wrote in his review of the film
how they rise and fall blend with the movement as a whole become pictures themselves
the title 's movement is carried through to the movement of the picture
the workers now just a painted UNknown rising in the background the design of the underground workers city
elevators transport the workers up and down between the machine halls and their living quarters
a new musical theme the theme of the city of the workers
the main square of the workers city
simply a transit area for the workers returning to their quarters
in the centre a gong again a kind of alarm clock
the downward scroll of the title is answered by a rising UNknown triangle pointing UNknown
an artificial grotto columns like UNknown young women in UNknown carnival costumes
orient inspired head UNknown
in contrast to the straight course of the young men animated turns UNknown directed by a UNknown UNknown
a playground is the pleasure garden of the sons an UNknown UNknown
nature sex UNknown in chaste UNknown
iike the water in the fountain a transparent dome UNknown a statue of a siren
the youth in white breeches and the girl with the UNknown de paris play hide and seek
their game a dance a pas de deux
UNknown yet so intensely innocent that we do not actually expect a real kiss
instead an UNknown glance UNknown accompanied by a new theme let us call it the love theme
answered by an apparition dressed in light grey it reads in the screenplay
from the smallest of d UNknown s rises a head with solemn eyes and glowing blonde hair
the UNknown countenance of the virgin the sweet countenance of the mother reads the novel
the mother without a man
freder 's dream
the subject of her glance is freder the brother the son of fredersen the nothing more than son
all names in metropolis are UNknown in meaning
UNknown by the clarinet a new UNknown based theme which from now on will accompany the entrances of the young woman
a door closes communication is interrupted
this will be repeated at several decisive moments throughout the film providing the UNknown for further action on the part of its UNknown
nothing could help him nothing the novel states at this point
ln a UNknown UNknown UNknown stood before his eyes the vision a countenance the UNknown countenance of the virgin the sweet countenance of the mother
later we learn that freder lost his mother at birth
not in the workers city as one would think
freder arrives in a machine hall
in the novel he now comes face to face with a machine of his own construction
he strokes it feels its limbs presses his face to its bulk
in the film the machine is also a living organism
freder in the novel
blood pressure and temperature of the film machine rise
perhaps i will feel your trembling and the UNknown of pulse in your rigid body
perhaps i shall experience the UNknown with which you UNknown yourself into your vast element bearing me the man who made you
but freder also knows freder in the novel
nothing in this world is more UNknown than the jealousy of a machine that feels neglected
in the film the machine is called the m machine
m as in mother ?
m as in UNknown
the film of the future is also a film of UNknown a biblical film
UNknown the god of the UNknown to whom the UNknown also sacrificed children to the UNknown of moses and his god
the film is UNknown with UNknown to the old and new UNknown
in the music the UNknown theme switches to the theme of the workers city
UNknown of workers in rows of six march into the mouth of UNknown which UNknown back into the machine
in the music the fredersen theme UNknown him as a self confident UNknown
joh fredersen joh with h
than he was once again a boy of ten
nothing more than the son of this father
the music the UNknown theme tells us what freder is speaking about
the gestures of the son unlike those of the father display trust seek contact
fredersen looks past him his gaze rests on the secretary
fredersen 's glances are orders as are his words his gestures
camera movements are rare in metropolis and are always significant
here the camera is guided by the movements of the actors the pace of the discussion moves the camera stops it moves it on first it UNknown
then it pans with father and son
it is in the children not the adults that freder UNknown his siblings himself as the infant UNknown of the virgin the motherly a kind of infant jesus
fredersen is not only ruler but also builder of metropolis
his city an UNknown dream a dazzling UNknown city UNknown UNknown UNknown as the urban UNknown the new tower of babel
first from the strings then the horns UNknown UNknown marcia the theme of the uprising begins
a video telephone on the wall behind
fredersen 's office is the control communication and command centre
his power is based on information
above fredersen on the wall the lower edge of the 1 0 hour clock is now visible
fredersen 's power lies in his ability to control the time of his UNknown
the worker the capitalist the clerk the model of modern class society
the position of the seemingly privileged employee is in fact the most UNknown
again a door closes behind somebody this person 's disappearance UNknown freder to dedicate himself to this person
again freder runs
for the father the door closes behind him
fredersen in right profile
take note of just how differently
lang stages dialogue
and again in an act of UNknown
once again he is confronted with the spectacle of a machine
in the novel it is called the UNknown machine so let 's keep it so it keeps the elevator system in the new tower of babel moving
in the film it has no obvious function it is purely UNknown
an UNknown machine if you like
the change of clothing UNknown freder 's rebellion against the father
this is the beginning of the UNknown of the son of jehovah his passion
this cut is up to now the most serious intervention carried out by the UNknown
then from a far distance came rotwang and UNknown great resistance took it for his own
the rotwang musical theme is UNknown of the UNknown music
fredersen is the only person in metropolis who respects rotwang 's genius
the removal of this figure is the UNknown UNknown executed by the UNknown
the hel of the UNknown UNknown was the ruler of the underworld motherly goddess of death
in hel rotwang has lost his lover
fredersen his wife
how lang stages a dramatic dialogue
fredersen in right profile
fredersen in right profile rotwang in left profile
the audience UNknown at times UNknown at times UNknown observer
curtain up for rotwang 's first scene the entry of the mechanical woman the new hel
on the wall a UNknown the magical symbol the tip pointing UNknown suggests the UNknown
a metallic UNknown with female physical UNknown with breasts and on the UNknown mounted and UNknown the UNknown
the music echoes the most important UNknown of the mechanical woman theme
it UNknown three UNknown UNknown to the various aspects of the being and which at times appear separately at times in unison
rotwang 's artificial limb is steel steel from the steel of the creature to whom he sacrificed his hand
another parallel scene freder still at the machine
fredersen with rotwang UNknown the next sequence
rotwang 's library ancient UNknown and a neon UNknown lamp rotwang caught between middle ages and future
fredersen in contrast with a UNknown tre UNknown on his wrist is the UNknown of twenties UNknown
freder 's passion the factory is his UNknown his cross the clock the father god 's instrument of power
the UNknown is not UNknown
lack of information is the UNknown for fredersen 's departure
for the first time we see him physically in motion moving from one scene to another
fredersen and rotwang descend from right to left
ieft right the workers freder between them
both groups heading towards the same scene
mother look at me !
both UNknown of the plot UNknown in rotwang 's and fredersen 's glance down into the crypt
they do not recognise freder in the scene
the preacher is reciting a screenplay
which freder turns into a film for us
the creative man priest ruler architect
accompanied by the music played during the opening credits of the film
what here looks like a UNknown construction in UNknown shot turns out to be a model around which a group of UNknown has gathered
new to the music the tower of babel theme
five groups of workers a UNknown
like the fingers on a hand
end of the UNknown the sermon end of the projection
a look into the camera into our eyes
thus we learn her name
in the novel freder asks
what should i call you ?
UNknown UNknown marcia the theme of the uprising
fredersen believes he has seen enough
what rotwang sees however and wants to prevent fredersen from seeing because a new plan is UNknown in his mind
a dialogue is opening
his hand UNknown her
UNknown her gaze sweeps her gaze directly into the camera moving gently to him UNknown both in the picture the speaker always in UNknown profile the UNknown UNknown from behind
an erotic dialogue regardless of what the titles say
the love theme is playing
now stops and is replaced by the rotwang and fredersen UNknown in UNknown variations
the couple is UNknown threatened by the theme of the uprising
will rotwang give up his project to recreate hel or will he extend it if it can be used to steal his rival 's son from him
the son of hel who he himself expected from her ?
mary 's light is candlelight natural soft like her
the realm of death the realm of hel
is freder 's dead mother jealous of her son 's love is this why she joins forces with her destroyer ?
rotwang 's lamp is a mechanical tool like his steel hand the entire man a UNknown of man and machine
lucifer the UNknown of light is one of the evil one 's names
he showed this scene to a hollywood specialist wrote lang
they could do it said lang
they just did not think of it and
light and shadow should not only be used to convey a mood but should also play a decisive role in the action
the cathedral a second piece of the middle ages
UNknown gothic grandeur ceremony incense it says in the screenplay
in the centre of the scene a column reaching towards the heavens
iike the trunk of a palm in the novel the cathedral UNknown a fanatical sect the UNknown who persistently offer fredersen resistance
the UNknown of the film reduced this strand of the plot even more
again a parallel action which interferes in the current action UNknown it into a UNknown
the music in the cathedral scene the dies UNknown musical UNknown for death and disaster
in the original version of the film the musical UNknown is UNknown with the memory of the UNknown sermon of the monk at the cathedral
this is the longest piece to have been cut from the film
the story of freder the good boy
rotwang the sorcerer and the abducted mary gives metropolis the air of a UNknown in a particularly UNknown way
many UNknown are based on the abduction of a person
the hero the UNknown is shown the way
like the trail of a scent says the novel
the glow in front of him led him up the stairs
the old house sucks freder in it makes him its prisoner it draws him into the depths
the machinery of the old house is like a model of the UNknown mechanism which keeps both hero and audience moving always being shown something before it quickly disappears again
a vision a staging
rotwang 's laboratory was half a quack 's kitchen from the year 1 500 and half experimental laboratory of a man from the year 2000
in rotwang 's character UNknown and lang UNknown both magic and UNknown in one UNknown
a UNknown like the film in which he appears
that could have been conceived and staged by him just like the transformation of the mechanical woman into the image of mary
his staging UNknown both feminine and masculine form and movement translated into a spectacle of light
a UNknown act of UNknown
rotwang 's experimental table with mary as snow white waiting in her glass coffin to be awakened can be seen as the couch of rotwang the psychoanalyst
her subconscious UNknown itself in the UNknown of light stretching between her and the mechanical woman
freder like awakening from a nightmare sees himself in another one
hel 's room her memorial is behind the curtain
mary 's theme UNknown in a minor key
the false mary flesh of the flesh of the true mary while at the same time a remote controlled machine at the core
why is fredersen so UNknown determined to destroy the true mary ?
in the figure of the merciful preacher he seems to sense a female challenge
that of UNknown to his UNknown principle of absolute power
freder 's UNknown experience
at this point in the novel freder chokes his father
i want to kill you !
i want to destroy you !
i want to murder you !
in the film a fall UNknown into the depth into the UNknown of his subconscious
freder in bed the father in tails
an obvious feeling of helplessness in front of his father 's aura of authority
the son remains in the care of the in part female staff
a sick child
can it be that freder and rotwang are not so much rivals as the alter UNknown of each other ?
they love the same woman the dead hel
the absence of the mother the lover provides the inspiration for freder 's visions just as much as for rotwang 's UNknown
rotwang 's audience consists entirely of men old and young fathers and sons
like a blasphemous halo says the screenplay the UNknown on the woman 's head appears in the round opening of the UNknown roof that fades out
rotwang 's show is a film another of rotwang 's light productions with footlights and counter lighting
rotwang 's show and freder 's delirium become one
an important strand in this UNknown freder 's UNknown of the monk 's UNknown in the cathedral has again been cut by the UNknown
UNknown from the action which was shown isolated edited gestures and the positions of the dancer combined with the picture of the audience
groups singles only eyes finally
rotwang 's production becomes lang 's pure UNknown cinema
rotwang 's show now clearly becomes freder 's vision the memory of the seven deadly sins in the cathedral
of the monk 's sermon on the whore of babylon which he associates with the image of the false mary the new hel the mother whore
which becomes one with that of the metropolis the mother city
freder convalescent is reading
again two parallel scenes the second once more cut by the UNknown
the spy reports to the father the friend to the son
nothing remains of this scene but screenplay and score
iead to the assumption that these takes were repeated here
fredersen gives slim an order
a third reporting situation is UNknown in after the other two
rotwang tells mary
like the group of rich sons in the dancehall the group of workers in the UNknown too fall under the spell of the vamp
like the evil character in a fairy tale rotwang pretends his own child to be the one he keeps as a prisoner
UNknown regarded the red mary 's speech as inciting and ordered a UNknown form for the second version
instead of the title became
who wants to work himself to death for the rulers of metropolis ?
instead of in the UNknown version it became
who are the slaves of metropolis ?
and for the false mary had to say
let them rot
he sees through the double
the UNknown found the construction with rotwang 's report as the UNknown around the second UNknown scene too complicated
UNknown 's UNknown not only seals freder 's new role as a critical UNknown but also shows him as a future saviour as a new messiah
the central square of the workers city has become a stage in the theatre of the revolution
the first beats of the marseillaise
not only the music is UNknown with the character of a citation
the way the false mary whips the crowd into a frenzy UNknown to her performance in front of the rich sons
the gong UNknown is a tribune for the performance in which not only she takes part but an UNknown UNknown
in a later scene the movement UNknown and reversed we will see them empty crashing down
in the beginning only men were present here now we see women the workers wives female workers
at the start the workers silently waiting for the raising of the UNknown now the unleashed mass men and women UNknown determined to blow it up
the children abandoned by their biological fathers and mothers offered for adoption by mary the maternal and freder the brother
again two people two UNknown UNknown audio UNknown bound by the video telephone in fredersen 's office control and command tool of the ruler of metropolis
UNknown and superior
the two UNknown now in parallel action the true the white finally free to continue her reconciliation work
and the false the red the force behind uprising and destruction
mary on her way to the city of the workers to save the children abandoned by their fathers and mothers
like a counter manoeuvre to her own creation by rotwang as a light show electric UNknown sorcery the false mary UNknown the destruction of the heart machine
before leaving the stage via a back stairway a shadow UNknown a staircase exit to another theatre another audience the sons of the rich
arm movements as though in UNknown of the UNknown of the disk still identifying with the machine even during its destruction
the elevators now finally descending UNknown
deep under the city there wanders a stream joh fredersen constructed a path for the stream when he built the city of the workers
now the unleashed waters of the depths join the uprising of the humans
we have seen rotwang working the UNknown in his laboratory and the other mary working the UNknown of the heart machine
now she is moving the UNknown of the gong machine
the gong UNknown the alarm clock the tribune UNknown the revolt is now used to save the children
the square fills with the water and the children
no more doubt
not just a couple but three a trinity of which there soon will be more with UNknown members
they take care of the children the innocent offspring of the workers who have refused to be rescued by them
a last climb through the UNknown from the depths of the workers city to the club of the sons
the flying camera UNknown the pressure of the explosion which rocks the city to its foundations
finale with mary 's theme
general pause then again the theme of the uprising men and women dancing in two UNknown circles as though still under the spell of the machines they destroyed
four actually five UNknown and actions with various characters are now UNknown
fredersen 's office
this question is UNknown answered
by a UNknown from the mechanical woman 's theme
UNknown the yoshiwara where to a UNknown the false mary
UNknown the sons of the rich to dance on the volcano
the workers abandon the scene of action
UNknown the entrance of the club of the sons
and the children
and finally UNknown rotwang 's attic room where fredersen 's down and out opponent recovers
this plot of UNknown UNknown again proved too complicated for the UNknown they UNknown they UNknown
they edited the film giving the impression that the false mary is the only victim of the witch hunt and that the true mary is in no danger
by UNknown this shot the true mary becomes the other
only when you carefully look you see here !
mary running across the screen escaping from her UNknown who manage to couple her double
UNknown the workers construct a stake in front of the cathedral
the stake is made from metal the wrecks of cars partly with their headlights UNknown
the false mary tied to the stake
she who was created by electrical sparks totally in her element in a display of UNknown lust
UNknown and freder separated
but he knew he had died
and this UNknown filled him with the deepest satisfaction
he only wanted his hel
upon finding hel he would no longer have reason to quarrel with anything on earth
hel he says in the novel
i am not a ghost although i have died i had to die to come to you
mary the virgin and her double both in mortal danger a mirror image in one scene
the red mary at the stake the white in the cathedral pursued by rotwang
the bells of the cathedral come to her aid UNknown the saviour
iike the gong before in the workers city
as freder watches the fire burns away the flesh of the false mary revealing her mechanical core UNknown triumphant accompanied by one of the mechanical woman UNknown in UNknown major
the scene on the cathedral roof is UNknown of victor hugo 's
hunchback of notre dame
an unmistakable reference the UNknown
after the demise of the evil half of the female double pair the final battle between the two male rivals is UNknown on the roof of the cathedral
freder the naive fool has learnt through his passion to UNknown between truth and lies
then in the face of the needs of the children he has ripened to an active person now he is capable of dealing with his UNknown
fredersen kneeling he too UNknown through suffering
slim and UNknown another antagonistic pair unite to offer him assistance
and finally UNknown the foreman less class conscious than loyal to his rulers
in UNknown 's gravity 's rainbow p UNknown remembers how rotwang carried mary onto the roof of the cathedral
he was taken by klein UNknown playing the mad inventor who he himself and his fellow students would have loved to be
mary fredersen 's mother hel
in UNknown 's screenplay mary acting on an appeal from the workers wives calls on freder to be a mediator
in the film as shot by lang the women retreat totally into the underground and background the women retreat totally into the underground and background
for the finale the mediator theme
the rest is dealt with by the chiefs the representatives of state and people of capital and labour
the social partners still require mutual trust
they need a mediator removed from the parties interests
mary as a woman is permitted to deliver the cue
thus completing her task
the interpretation is part of the film 's story even if UNknown bizarre and excessive
every UNknown dreams its successor
based on the comic by UNknown UNknown
screenplay by UNknown UNknown
UNknown director shuichi UNknown
music UNknown honda
i tremble at the honour of announcing the UNknown of humanity 's long history of intellect and science
our power UNknown the earth
now it will UNknown the stars !
may it stand forever !
our ziggurat !
they don 't know their place !
but our economy is unthinkable without robot labour
yes but they cause f UNknown with human workers
the enemy is developing new weapons
what metropolis needs is a leader who will be a UNknown UNknown symbol !
duke red with the ziggurat complete will you be entering politics ?
don 't be silly !
as long as president boone UNknown our state is secure
politics has no need of me
mr president would you like to see duke red in politics ?
don 't encourage him !
how could i compete with anyone so popular ?
is it true there are military facilities in the ziggurat ?
would the mayor care to comment ?
ask minister of state skunk about that
hurray for the ziggurat !
long live metropolis !
who knows ?
there he is !
i UNknown e given you the best facilities money can buy !
if you could wait a little longer i 'm almost done
i 'm tired of hearing that
i UNknown l be at your lab tomorrow night
but it 's not the kind of place you 'd go to !
and the place is a mess !
get back to work !
it 's me
you were supposed to have that under control !
i merely found you during the last war and took you in
i have a letter of introduction to superintendent UNknown
the international human rights committee and other organizations have warrants for him for UNknown experiments and dealing in human organs
to which end i ask for your cooperation seeing i UNknown e never been in this city and i don 't know east f rom west here
i 'd like to help but with the UNknown for the ziggurat going on all week it 's taking every single person i have to keep things under control
i don 't have anybody
well i could give you a robot if that 's okay with you
a robot ? !
do i have to return him with a f UNknown tank ?
he only needs UNknown UNknown every five years
soon they won 't need us anymore
i 'm kenichi
i am model 803 d UNknown UNknown 497 3 c
uh how do you do ?
the completion of the ziggurat UNknown our metropolis as the world leader in industry economics and culture
thus is born a state that will last a thousand years !
i tremble at the honour of announcing the UNknown of humanity 's long history of intellect and science
our power UNknown the earth
now it will UNknown the stars !
may it stand forever !
our ziggurat !
d UNknown UNknown 3 c
don 't you have an easier name ?
we are not allowed human names as it may UNknown UNknown upon human rights
i know !
that 's a dog 's name !
that 's right
he was a great dog
in my opinion a criminal could not hide up here in metropolis
i have reliable sources that say he 's here !
dr laughton would not hide up here
he would go to zone 1
zone 1 ?
it is simply a calculation of UNknown
robots are strictly forbidden to operate outside their assigned area
that robot was not authorized to operate at surface level
okay but who are those guys ?
they look like fascists
movement between levels is restricted
no one who carries the mark may pass through this gate
so that robot had the mark ?
there are of course hidden ways and people who work as guides to them
damn right !
it takes light to create shadow i guess
this level is not particularly dangerous but there are places in which police writ does not run
a void them
we 'r e not here as tourists
her final stage energy UNknown isn 't stable yet
are you using real organs ?
dear me no !
hers are mechanical
when will you finish ?
within the week
i UNknown l put on the finishing touches and together we will flee !
protecting my father is my most important task
and the child who died was a girl
no mad scientist is going to deceive my father
and no mannequin like this will steal his heart
tima is the super being who is to sit on the throne of power UNknown the ziggurat
you lie !
perhaps you should ask duke red about that
will you destroy the super being for whom the one you call father waits ?
no robot will steal my father !
i saw him !
atlas is right !
to arms !
please remain calm
everyone please step back
this is no time to be fighting !
what the ? !
well that strange old man was around
an old man ?
i guess he was doing an experiment
the fire just ripped right through it
what happened to him ?
his body was found
what 's wrong father ?
what did dr laughton mean to you ?
get out !
well it was just an old factory
saves the trouble of tearing it down
this is strange
there should be something left
pero who 's that ?
rock of the UNknown
they say he does duke red 's dirty work
duke red ?
he 's the party founder
now there 's no official connection but he f UNknown their activities
it 's a public secret
it UNknown up ahead with the sewage f rom zone 2 and goes to the processing plant in zone 3
if she 's down there she UNknown l have been chopped up with the garbage
anyone else yes
an old saying but a good one
we should continue searching for kenichi
who are you ?
your name your family your father your mother
no don 't eat that !
it UNknown l make you sick !
no don 't eat
magnetic UNknown 3
optical target UNknown 1 06
radiation equipment in position
citizens won 't be affected but UNknown robots will
i 'm having everything recorded
the data will be valuable
begin at level 3
solar constant deviation at minus 24
five seconds to sector r
4 3 2 1
35 000 40 000 45 000
UNknown field UNknown 800 and rising
you now hold the power of the gods themselves
if only dr laughton had finished building our guardian deity
he 's caused UNknown in UNknown and bathed earth in harmful magnetic radiation
it 's an outrage that he would endanger national security by developing such a thing !
the UNknown robot hunters are using this as an ex cuse to cry human rights and press for changes in the robot law
the pro robot citizens groups say that 's reactionary nonsense
they 'r e organizing protests
there 's fighting breaking out
this is our chance mr president !
we could make a case for treason here
will the military support us ?
some units are under duke red 's influence but i can handle that
we UNknown l stir up the public with a few leaks
once sentiment is against duke red we UNknown l arrest him for treason
should military action be needed you have my approval
i suspect he was the guy who did in laughton
what i don 't understand is how they were connected
just what was laughton working on anyway ?
what will you do ?
laughton 's already dead
my client deserves that
zone 2 i think
how far down does this place go ?
zone 2 is the metropolis power plant area
zone 3 below that is the sewage handling facility
the sewage facility
i UNknown l report back and get permission to go below
i UNknown l file a missing persons report on kenichi too
how often are you down here ?
twice a week for maintenance on the robots
these are albert ii types
it 's their last check this week
is anyone here ?
no human could last a day at this work
what is it ?
this is a restricted area !
so she survived
it 's all right
stop that please !
are you okay ?
you piece of junk !
thanks for everything fifi
i 'm rock of the UNknown !
demonstrations are forbidden during celebration week
please disperse immediately
they have to be !
keep looking !
what 's the matter atlas ?
we 'r e waiting for your signal !
was there a leak ?
they 'r e the reason
rock 's after them
who are you ?
i 'm kenichi
my uncle 's a private
a private what ?
i don 't know
i don 't trust them
let 's kill them
he says he 's a journalist
if he can tell the world about metropolis that helps us !
we can 't waste time on nice uniforms and our pictures in the paper
the uniform i die in will be the uniform of the revolution !
look at that !
there are no schools and hardly any jobs
they survive on food UNknown but with the ziggurat UNknown that 's all been stopped
what does ziggurat mean ?
it 's an ancient UNknown tower
the tower of babel was one
you know what happened to that
the king 's pride brought down the wrath of god on him
history repeats itself
but it won 't be god this time
it UNknown l be us
is that wrong ?
what kind of hair do you like ?
yours is fine right now
let 's get back to your writing
thank you kenichi
that helps a lot
the UNknown are to move when the ziggurat UNknown end
we want you to crush them and storm the ziggurat
the president will announce the arrest of duke red for treason
he will invoke his powers to take control of the police and military
then metropolis will be governed by the rule of law
and we will participate as a proper political party
of course atlas
the things i get myself into !
i finally find that kid and look what happens !
i 'm sorry i could not have been of more assistance
what are you talking about ?
you UNknown e been lots of help !
i don 't know east f rom west here
don 't worry about kenichi
he 's tougher than he
cut that out !
oh man !
tell the whole world how angry we are
i 'm all out of breath !
we 'd better get out of here pero
we can 't do anything
ask headquarters for backup
it 's robots they 'r e going to attack first !
i will be fine
are you going to hold this gate all by yourself ?
demonstrations are forbidden during celebration week
our time has come
yes we all know that
i agree it is a problem
it 's our emotions
but without UNknown them we can 't survive
it 's time for the uprising to begin
when should we release a statement ?
things should be clear by about 1 p m so i suggest 3 or 3 30
what is it minister ?
hard to relax eh ?
yes mr president
what the ? !
i am merely history 's agent
martial law is in effect under the command of duke red
abandon your weapons and surrender
i repeat the coup d tat has failed
martial law is in effect under the command of duke red
abandon your weapons and surrender
that 's great !
tima this is my uncle
we meet at last
don 't make promises you won 't keep rock !
don 't play games with me !
tima pick up the gun !
i UNknown l have that back please
don 't give it to him !
you going to shoot ?
i 'm human you know
you told me no one survived the fire in dr laughton 's lab !
and how did you know about tima ?
answer me !
no robot must ever rule the ziggurat and metropolis !
you 'r e out of line boy !
get up !
what if i did ?
i UNknown e come f rom japan to arrest laughton
my name is UNknown ban
i 'm here to see superintendent UNknown
he 's been transferred
there 's been a mistake
the UNknown have taken my nephew away
handle it through your embassy !
at this moment our state UNknown its reach to the stars !
i tremble at the honour of announcing the UNknown of humanity 's long history of intellect and science
hot whiskey then
and those UNknown can eat UNknown !
what 's he doing here ?
i said no
i can 't move at the moment so i can 't come to you
i 'm leaving the country soon
i want to see you again
you will bring her back soon won 't you ?
i UNknown l be in real trouble if they ever find out
don 't worry
this wasn 't my idea
i have to get back
you tricked me
where 's kenichi ?
well well well
i guess father chose his mad scientist very well
what are you talking about ?
you being a robot
so what are you ?
where is he ?
if you can 't take me to kenichi i 'm going
tima 's gone ? !
watch where you 'r e going !
let 's see inside this super being that father wants so much
come on laughton !
where 's kenichi ?
i need your help for that
you do ?
i need to look for him on the ziggurat 's data network
can you do that ?
hold out your hand
you did it !
what happened to me ?
what do you mean ?
i UNknown l report the instant we find anything sir
duke red ?
got it !
the hotel coconut
well you 'r e different f rom normal robots
i 'm human
anyway now we UNknown e got to rescue kenichi
tell me what 's going on or i UNknown l charge you with kidnapping !
i 'm not your man
it 's your son you want to talk to
and i suspect you had him killed to keep her a secret
take him away
one day f rom here you will rule the entire world !
he 's in no danger
we just had to quiet him down a little
it UNknown l be an international incident !
make kenichi the way he was
what 's one or two young kids tima ?
you have the power to rule the world !
what power is that ?
am i human ?
oh don 't be silly !
you 'r e nothing like those piles of junk !
then am i human like kenichi ?
what are you saying ? !
you 'r e no mere human being ruled by emotion and feeling torn between morality and love !
you are the super being !
so then i am a
i UNknown e brought you new clothes miss tima
yes you are a robot but you stand at the UNknown of all existence !
that 's because your f UNknown UNknown haven 't yet taken form
as your abilities evolve they 'r e taking the form of emotion and love
your memories and emotions will all be erased !
how did you know that ? !
i fancy myself a detective
come miss tima
what are you doing ?
it is you who must sit on that throne
you are the leader we must bow to !
i am a UNknown a machine made to destroy the world
not destroy !
it just started up !
cut the power !
it 's going into the red !
dr UNknown !
the UNknown generator 's going wild !
what 's going on ?
i 'm not sure
this comes of trifling with robots
her memory 's UNknown with the data network
she UNknown l go mad !
thus god destroyed the tower of babel
the chance of human survival will fall to 30 percent within one hour
my entire worldwide network of forces will be completely UNknown within 30 minutes
their targets are the world 's major cities and UNknown other facilities
estimated time period for UNknown of humanity by biological warfare
17 hours 27 minutes
your super being says she doesn 't need us !
what 's happening ?
i am who ?
and high above a pleasure garden for the sons of the masters of metropolis
who was that ?
the great machines far underground yet high above the workers city
why did you go down there ?
i wanted to see what my brothers looked like
it was their hands that built this city of ours father
in their proper place the UNknown
what will you do if they turn against you some day ?
the foreman from the central UNknown room is here with an urgent message
more of those plans sir
they were found on two of the men who were killed today
joseph why was it not you who brought me these plans ?
you are dismissed
father don 't you realize what it means to be dismissed by you ?
joseph i need your help
i have far to go today alone into the depths to my UNknown
the machine !
i will stay at the machine
in the middle of the city was an old house
here lived rotwang the inventor
at last my work is ready
i have created a machine in the image of man that never tires or makes a mistake
now we have no further use for living workers
isn 't it worth the loss of a hand to have created the workers of the future the machine men ?
give me another 24 hours and i UNknown l bring you a machine which no one will be able to tell from a hum
as always when my experts fail i come to you for advice
for months now we have been finding these plans in the workers clothing
what do they mean ?
at two at the end of this shift
she has called another meeting
these are the plans of the ancient UNknown far below the lowest levels of the workers city
what is down there that interests the workers ?
today i will tell you the story of the tower of babel
let us build a tower whose summit will touch the skies
and on it we will UNknown
UNknown UNknown is the world and its creator
and great is man
between the brain that plans and the hands that build there must be a mediator
it is the heart that must bring about an understanding between them
but where is our mediator maria ?
be patient he will surely come
we will wait but not for long
rotwang make your robot in the likeness of that girl
hide the girl in your house i will send the robot down to the workers to sow discord among them a
leave me here john fredersen
until tomorrow in the cathedral
the seven deadly sins
come i am going to make the robot look like you
the copy is perfect
john fredersen is looking for an excuse to use violence against the workers
maria you always pleaded for peace but now the robot in your likeness has been commanded to inc
the workers accept the robot as maria
i have preached patience
maria is inciting the workers to revolt
she has told them to destroy everything
i cannot believe it
the time has come to act !
why should you sweat yourself to death to benefit the lord of metropolis ?
who keeps the machines going ?
who are the slaves of the machines ?
let the machines stop !
destroy the machines !
maria UNknown for peace not for violence
this is not maria !
john fredersen 's son !
kill him !
to the central power house !
the workers are destroying the machines
what shall i do ?
if they destroy the power house the workers city will be flooded
open the doors
you are flooding your own homes
at last maria managed to escape

the chief foreman of the heart machine UNknown with an important message

in the middle of metropolis there was a strange house overlooked by the centuries
the man who lived in it was rotwang the inventor
lost to joh fredersen ; UNknown UNknown UNknown to freder hls son
a brain like yours rotwang should be able to forget
only once in my life did i forget anything that hel was a woman and you a man
let the dead rest in peace rotwang
for you as for me she is dead
for me she is not dead joh fredersen for me s h e i i v e s !
do you think that losing a hand is too high a price to pay for re creating hel ? !
do you want to see her ? !
so joh fredersen ? !
isn 't it worth the loss of a hand to have created the man of the future the m a c h i n e m a n ? !
give me another 24 hours and no one joh fredersen no one will be able to tell a
machine man from a mortal !
the woman is m i n e joh fredersen !
the son of hel was yours !
and what brings you to me joh fredersen ?
as usual when my experts fail me i come to you for advice
for months now we have been finding these plans in my workers clothes
what do they mean ?
at two at the end of the shift !
s h e has summoned us again
it is a plan of the 2000 year old UNknown deep below the lowest levels of your metropolis
i should like to know what my workers are doing in the UNknown
today i will tell you the legend of the tower of babel
the legend of the tower of babel
come let us build us a tower whose top may reach unto the stars !
and on the top of the tower we will write these words
great is the world and its creator !
and great is man !
but the minds that had conceived the tower of babel could not build it
the task was too great
so they hired hands for wages
but the h a n d s that built the tower of babel knew nothing of the dream of the b r a i n that had conceived it
one man 's hymns of praise became other men 's curses
people spoke the same language but could not understand each other
great is the world and its creator and great is man
head and hands need a mediator
the UNknown between head and hands must be the heart !
and where is o u r mediator maria ?
wait for him !
we will wait maria !
but not much longer !
oh mediator have you finally come ?
you called me here i am !
rotwang give the machine man the likeness of that girl
i shall show discord between them and her !
i shall destroy their belief in this woman
leave me alone now joh fredersen
you will find the way back without me
you fool !
until tomorrow in the cathedral !
freder sees a monk in the pulpit who UNknown
verily i say unto you the days spoken of in the UNknown are nigh !
the monk 's hand points to the bible in which is written
and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns
and the woman was UNknown in purple and scarlet color having a golden cup in her hand
and upon her UNknown was a name written mystery babylon the great the mother of UNknown of the earth
you will destroy joh fredersen him and his city and his son !
UNknown greed pride
but now i beg you
stay away from me and my beloved !
where is the man whose clothes you wear ?
will you please wake UNknown ?
we must go at once to the workers city
i must have someone who is faithful to me UNknown how else can i fulfil my destiny ? !
i must go UNknown i must look on my own for the person to whom UNknown was supposed to lead me
tonight UNknown tonight when i come back
so what is your price for leaving this UNknown tonight ?
you do not seem to understand on whose behalf i am here
t h i s m a n does not wish his son to be here this evening !
in three hours i will come for you !
she is with your father
i tell you she is with your father !
she is the most perfect and obedient tool that ever man UNknown
you will see tonight when she dances before the eyes of the the hundred richest gentlemen
i w a n t you to visit those in the depths in order to destroy the work of the woman in whose image you were created !
c a rotwang invites mr joh fredersen to be his guest tonight
verily i say unto you the days spoken of in the UNknown are nigh !
for her all seven deadly sins !
death descends upon the city !
the book of UNknown
but for ten days your father 's spy has been making even the workers city risky
only their hope for a mediator is keeping the workers in check
there are still more strange things happening freder
on the evening when you fell sick
once the best of friends because of that woman
the other man the same evening
the eternal gardens lie abandoned but night after night in yoshiwara
and this woman at whose feet all sins are UNknown is a i s o named maria
the same woman who those in the depths look up to as a saint ? !
many now go to the city of the dead to a woman who has proven herself as true as gold
but the mediator must appear
whatever happens tonight it is my express order to let the workers do as they will
joh fredersen wants to let those in the depths use force and do wrong so that he can claim the right to use force against them
when you spoke to your poor brothers you spoke of peace maria
today a mouthpiece of joh fredersen is inciting them to rebel against him
she will destroy their belief in a mediator !
you know that i have always spoken of peace but your mediator has not come
you have waited long enough !
your time has come !
but i have tricked joh fredersen !
your double does not obey h i s will only m i n e !
who is the living food for the machines in metropolis ? !
who UNknown the machine joints with their own blood ? !
who feeds the machines with their own flesh ? !
let the machines starve you fools !
let them die !!
you are not maria !!!
you are not UNknown !
maria speaks of peace not killing !
this is not maria !!
joh fredersen 's son !!
kill him the dog in his white silken fur !!!
get your women your sons from the workers city !
let no one stay behind !
death to the machines !!!
in the attic with maria rotwang grows ever more intoxicated by his triumph over fredersen and i tricked joh fredersen twice over !
for i concealed from him that his son wants to be your brothers mediator and loves you !
maria is not the only one listening to rotwang
outside the attic window
joh fredersen breaks into rotwang 's attic
he battles with his old rival UNknown him
maria is free
women and men let no one miss today !
death to the machines !!
not one man or woman UNknown behind !
away from the machines !
l e t them spin out of control !
the heart machine !
if the heart machine is destroyed the entire machine district will end up in ruins !!
have you gone mad ??
if the heart machine is destroyed the entire workers city will be flooded !!
where are your fathers your mothers ?
do you know that your son is among the workers ?
yes you !
the UNknown have burst !
the city is flooding !
we will take the children to the club of the sons !
why are all the lights out ?
i must know !
tomorrow thousands will ask in fury and desperation
joh fredersen where is my son !
where are your children ?? !
the city lies underwater the shafts are completely flooded !!
who told you to attack the machines you idiots ?
without them you UNknown l all die !!

following its first projection the film metropolis was considerably UNknown and UNknown
more than 25 of the original film was regarded as lost
in UNknown an almost complete copy was found in buenos aires
the print was seriously UNknown and the image partly UNknown because of the copy 's 16 mm UNknown

the spanish UNknown titles were UNknown
a black edge was applied where the image is UNknown to fit the 16 mm UNknown
the UNknown appear in their original style
the lost parts essential to the comprehension of the plot are UNknown by titles in a modern UNknown
the shorter missing sections are marked with black frames
a film produced by UNknown and distributed by UNknown
as deep as lay the workers city below the earth
so high above it UNknown the complex club named the club of the sons with its
lecture halls and libraries its theaters and UNknown

all seven deadly sins for her sake !
death descends upon the city !
the book of UNknown
the only thing keeping the workers in check is that they still wait for the mediator that was promised to them
more strange things have happened freder
on the night you fell sick
once the best of friends were because of that woman
the other man the same evening
the eternal gardens lie abandoned but night after night in yoshiwara
and this woman at whose feet all sins are UNknown is also named maria

many now go to the city of the dead to a woman who has proven herself as true as gold
but the mediator must not be missing !
whatever happens tonight it is my express orders to let the workers do as they will
joh fredersen wants to let those in the depths use force and do wrong
so that he can claim the right to use force against them
when you spoke to your poor brothers you spoke of peace maria
today a mouthpiece of joh fredersen is inciting them to rebel against him
she will destroy their belief in a mediator !
you know that i have always spoken of peace but your mediator has not come
you have waited long enough !
your time as come !
but i have tricked joh fredersen !
your double does not obey his will only mine !
who is the living food for the machines in metropolis ? !

who feeds the machines with their own flesh ? !
let the machines starve you fools !

you are not maria !!!

maria speaks of peace not killing !
this is not maria !!
joh fredersen 's son !!
kill him the dog in his white silken fur !!

in the attic with maria rotwang grows ever more intoxicated by his triumph over fredersen and i tricked joh fredersen twice over !
for i concealed from him that his son wants to be your brothers mediator and loves you !
maria is not the only one listening to rotwang
outside the attic window joh fredersen has been eavesdropping

find the witch this is all her fault !

the witch !
burn the witch
to the stake with her !
oh mediator show them the way to each other
more than a quarter of the film must be regarded as UNknown lost
few other films have been so systematically changed mutilated corrupted as this one
shots and titles have been omitted and changed
however of no other such UNknown film do we know so well what the film originally looked like
fritz lang and thea von UNknown different sex siamese twins
just like their film
at this point the music started during the first screening
the metropolis theme
thea von UNknown 's message lang didn 't believe in it
metropolis the mother city city of mothers mother of all cities
the city the film they too are machines
UNknown a UNknown an eccentric disk
a machine without workers devoid of function pure movement UNknown UNknown a machine of desire
round shapes and jerking movements become one within the image of two clocks
one 12 hour and one 10 hour clock
day shift and night shift 10 hours each mark the metropolis working day
two groups of workers UNknown in rows of six march in unison the exhausted half as fast as the fresh
they moved their feet but were not walking reads the novel
the way people move or are moved is always highly significant throughout the film
the workers theme a funeral march
the night shift enters a cage the grate is raised the cage sinks and with it the camera
a title picks up the movement
even the titles the young luis bu UNknown wrote in his review of the film
how they rise and fall blend with the movement as a whole become pictures themselves
the title 's movement is carried through to the movement of the picture
the workers now just a painted UNknown rising in the background the design of the underground workers city
elevators transport the workers up and down between the machine halls and their living quarters
a new musical theme the theme of the city of the workers
the main square of the workers city
simply a transit area for the workers returning to their quarters
in the centre a gong again a kind of alarm clock
the downward scroll of the title is answered by a rising UNknown triangle pointing UNknown
an artificial grotto columns like UNknown young women in UNknown carnival costumes
orient inspired head UNknown
in contrast to the straight course of the young men animated turns UNknown directed by a UNknown UNknown
a playground is the pleasure garden of the sons an UNknown UNknown
nature sex UNknown in chaste UNknown
like the water in the fountain a transparent dome UNknown a statue of a siren
the youth in white breeches and the girl with the UNknown de paris play hide and seek
their game a dance a pas de deux
UNknown yet so intensely innocent that we do not actually expect a real kiss
instead an UNknown glance UNknown accompanied by a new theme let us call it the love theme
answered by an apparition dressed in light grey it reads in the screenplay
from the smallest of d UNknown s rises a head with solemn eyes and glowing blonde hair
the UNknown countenance of the virgin the sweet countenance of the mother reads the novel
the mother without a man
freder 's dream
the subject of her glance is freder the brother the son of fredersen the nothing more than son
all names in metropolis are UNknown in meaning
UNknown by the clarinet a new UNknown based theme which from now on will accompany the entrances of the young woman
a door closes communication is interrupted
this will be repeated at several decisive moments throughout the film providing the UNknown for further action on the part of its UNknown
nothing could help him nothing the novel states at this point
in a UNknown UNknown UNknown stood before his eyes the vision a countenance the UNknown countenance of the virgin the sweet countenance of the mother
later we learn that freder lost his mother at birth
not in the workers city as one would think
freder arrives in a machine hall
in the novel he now comes face to face with a machine of his own construction
he strokes it feels its limbs presses his face to its bulk
in the film the machine is also a living organism
freder in the novel tonight i shall allow myself to be embraced by you pour my life into you and discover whether i can give you life
blood pressure and temperature of the film machine rise
perhaps i will feel your trembling and the UNknown of pulse in your rigid body
perhaps i shall experience the UNknown with which you UNknown yourself into your vast element bearing me the man who made you
but freder also knows freder in the novel
nothing in this world is more UNknown than the jealousy of a machine that feels neglected
in the film the machine is called the m machine
m as in mother ?
m as in UNknown
the film of the future is also a film of UNknown a biblical film
UNknown the god of the UNknown to whom the UNknown also sacrificed children to the UNknown of moses and his god
the film is UNknown with UNknown to the old and new UNknown
in the music the UNknown theme switches to the theme of the workers city
UNknown of workers in rows of six march into the mouth of UNknown which UNknown back into the machine
in the music the fredersen theme UNknown him as a self confident UNknown
joh fredersen joh with h
than he was once again a boy of ten
nothing more than the son of this father
the music the UNknown theme tells us what freder is speaking about
the gestures of the son unlike those of the father display trust seek contact
fredersen looks past him his gaze rests on the secretary
fredersen 's glances are orders as are his words his gestures
camera movements are rare in metropolis and are always significant
here the camera is guided by the movements of the actors the pace of the discussion moves the camera stops it moves it on first it UNknown
then it pans with father and son
it is in the children not the adults that freder UNknown his siblings himself as the infant UNknown of the virgin the motherly a kind of infant jesus
fredersen is not only ruler but also builder of metropolis
his city an UNknown dream a dazzling UNknown city UNknown UNknown UNknown as the urban UNknown the new tower of babel
first from the strings then the horns UNknown UNknown marcia the theme of the uprising begins UNknown UNknown marcia the theme of the uprising begins
a video telephone on the wall behind
fredersen 's office is the control communication and command centre
his power is based on information
above fredersen on the wall the lower edge of the 10 hour clock is now visible
fredersen 's power lies in his ability to control the time of his UNknown
the worker the capitalist the clerk the model of modern class society
the position of the seemingly privileged employee is in fact the most UNknown
again a door closes behind somebody this person 's disappearance UNknown freder to dedicate himself to this person
again freder runs
for the father the door closes behind him
fredersen in right profile
take note of just how differently
lang stages dialogue
and again in an act of UNknown
once again he is confronted with the spectacle of a machine
in the novel it is called the UNknown machine so let 's keep it so it keeps the elevator system in the new tower of babel moving
in the film it has no obvious function it is purely UNknown
an UNknown machine if you like
the change of clothing UNknown freder 's rebellion against the father
this is the beginning of the UNknown of the son of jehovah his passion
this cut is up to now the most serious intervention carried out by the UNknown
then from a far distance came rotwang and UNknown great resistance took it for his own
the rotwang musical theme is UNknown of the UNknown music
fredersen is the only person in metropolis who respects rotwang 's genius
the removal of this figure is the UNknown UNknown executed by the UNknown
the hel of the UNknown UNknown was the ruler of the underworld motherly goddess of death
in hel rotwang has lost his lover
fredersen his wife
how lang stages a dramatic dialogue
fredersen in right profile
fredersen in right profile rotwang in left profile
the audience UNknown at times UNknown at times UNknown observer
curtain up for rotwang 's first scene the entry of the mechanical woman the new hel
on the wall a UNknown the magical symbol the tip pointing UNknown suggests the UNknown
a metallic UNknown with female physical UNknown with breasts and on the UNknown mounted and UNknown the UNknown
the music echoes the most important UNknown of the mechanical woman theme
it UNknown three UNknown UNknown to the various aspects of the being and which at times appear separately at times in unison
rotwang 's artificial limb is steel steel from the steel of the creature to whom he sacrificed his hand
another parallel scene freder still at the machine
fredersen with rotwang UNknown the next sequence
rotwang 's library ancient UNknown and a neon UNknown lamp rotwang caught between middle ages and future
fredersen in contrast with a UNknown tre UNknown on his wrist is the UNknown of twenties UNknown
freder 's passion the factory is his UNknown his cross the clock the father god 's instrument of power
the UNknown is not UNknown
lack of information is the UNknown for fredersen 's departure
for the first time we see him physically in motion moving from one scene to another
fredersen and rotwang descend from right to left
left right the workers freder between them
both groups heading towards the same scene
mother look at me !
both UNknown of the plot UNknown in rotwang 's and fredersen 's glance down into the crypt
they do not recognise freder in the scene
the preacher is reciting a screenplay
which freder turns into a film for us
the creative man priest ruler architect
accompanied by the music played during the opening credits of the film
what here looks like a UNknown construction in UNknown shot turns out to be a model around which a group of UNknown has gathered
new to the music the tower of babel theme
five groups of workers a UNknown
like the fingers on a hand
end of the UNknown the sermon end of the projection
a look into the camera into our eyes
thus we learn her name
in the novel freder asks
what should i call you ?
UNknown UNknown marcia the theme of the uprising
fredersen believes he has seen enough
what rotwang sees however and wants to prevent fredersen from seeing because a new plan is UNknown in his mind
a dialogue is opening
his hand UNknown her
UNknown her gaze sweeps her gaze directly into the camera
moving gently to him UNknown both in the picture the speaker always in UNknown profile the UNknown UNknown from behind
an erotic dialogue regardless of what the titles say
the love theme is playing
now stops and is replaced by the rotwang and fredersen UNknown in UNknown variations
the couple is UNknown threatened by the theme of the uprising
will rotwang give up his project to recreate hel or will he extend it if it can be used to steal his rival 's son from him
the son of hel who he himself expected from her ?
mary 's light is candlelight natural soft like her
the realm of death the realm of hel
is freder 's dead mother jealous of her son 's love is this why she joins forces with her destroyer ?
rotwang 's lamp is a mechanical tool like his steel hand the entire man a UNknown of man and machine
lucifer the UNknown of light is one of the evil one 's names
he showed this scene to a hollywood specialist wrote lang
they just did not think of it and
light and shadow should not only be used to convey a mood but should also play a decisive role in the action
the cathedral a second piece of the middle ages
UNknown gothic grandeur ceremony incense it says in the screenplay
in the centre of the scene a column reaching towards the heavens
like the trunk of a palm in the novel the cathedral UNknown a fanatical sect the UNknown who persistently offer fredersen resistance
the UNknown of the film reduced this strand of the plot even more
again a parallel action which interferes in the current action UNknown it into a UNknown
the music in the cathedral scene the dies UNknown musical UNknown for death and disaster
in the original version of the film the musical UNknown is UNknown with the memory of the UNknown sermon of the monk at the cathedral
this is the longest piece to have been cut from the film
the story of freder the good boy
rotwang the sorcerer and the abducted mary gives metropolis the air of a UNknown in a particularly UNknown way
many UNknown are based on the abduction of a person
the hero the UNknown is shown the way
like the trail of a scent says the novel
the glow in front of him led him up the stairs
the old house sucks freder in it makes him its prisoner it draws him into the depths
the machinery of the old house is like a model of the UNknown mechanism which keeps both hero and audience moving always being shown something before it quickly disappears again
a vision a staging
rotwang 's laboratory was half a quack 's kitchen from the year 1500 and half experimental laboratory of a man from the year 2000
in rotwang 's character UNknown and lang UNknown both magic and UNknown in one UNknown
a UNknown like the film in which he appears
that could have been conceived and staged by him just like the transformation of the mechanical woman into the image of mary
his staging UNknown both feminine and masculine form and movement translated into a spectacle of light
a UNknown act of UNknown
rotwang 's experimental table with mary as snow white waiting in her glass coffin to be awakened can be seen as the couch of rotwang the psychoanalyst
her subconscious UNknown itself in the UNknown of light stretching between her and the mechanical woman
freder like awakening from a nightmare sees himself in another one
hel 's room her memorial is behind the curtain
mary 's theme UNknown in a minor key
the false mary flesh of the flesh of the true mary while at the same time a remote controlled machine at the core
why is fredersen so UNknown determined to destroy the true mary ?
in the figure of the merciful preacher he seems to sense a female challenge
that of UNknown to his UNknown principle of absolute power
freder 's UNknown experience
at this point in the novel freder chokes his father
i want to kill you !
i want to destroy you !
i want to murder you !
in the film a fall UNknown into the depth into the UNknown of his subconscious
freder in bed the father in tails
an obvious feeling of helplessness in front of his father 's aura of authority
the son remains in the care of the in part female staff
a sick child
can it be that freder and rotwang are not so much rivals as the alter UNknown of each other ?
they love the same woman the dead hel
the absence of the mother the lover provides the inspiration for freder 's visions just as much as for rotwang 's UNknown
rotwang 's audience consists entirely of men old and young fathers and sons
like a blasphemous halo says the screenplay the UNknown on the woman 's head appears in the round opening of the UNknown roof that fades out
rotwang 's show is a film another of rotwang 's light productions with footlights and counter lighting
rotwang 's show and freder 's delirium become one
an important strand in this UNknown freder 's UNknown of the monk 's UNknown in the cathedral has again been cut by the UNknown
UNknown from the action which was shown isolated edited gestures and the positions of the dancer combined with the picture of the audience
groups singles only eyes finally
rotwang 's production becomes lang 's pure UNknown cinema
rotwang 's show now clearly becomes freder 's vision the memory of the seven deadly sins in the cathedral
of the monk 's sermon on the whore of babylon which he associates with the image of the false mary the new hel the mother whore
which becomes one with that of the metropolis the mother city
freder convalescent is reading
again two parallel scenes the second once more cut by the UNknown
the spy reports to the father the friend to the son
nothing remains of this scene but screenplay and score
lead to the assumption that these takes were repeated here
fredersen gives slim an order
a third reporting situation is UNknown in after the other two
rotwang tells mary
like the group of rich sons in the dancehall the group of workers in the UNknown too fall under the spell of the vamp
like the evil character in a fairy tale rotwang pretends his own child to be the one he keeps as a prisoner
UNknown regarded the red mary 's speech as inciting and ordered a UNknown form for the second version
instead of the title became
who wants to work himself to death for the rulers of metropolis ?
instead of in the UNknown version it became
who are the slaves of metropolis ?
and for the false mary had to say
let them rot
he sees through the double
the UNknown found the construction with rotwang 's report as the UNknown around the second UNknown scene too complicated
UNknown 's UNknown not only seals freder 's new role as a critical UNknown but also shows him as a future saviour as a new messiah
the central square of the workers city has become a stage in the theatre of the revolution
the first beats of the marseillaise
not only the music is UNknown with the character of a citation
the way the false mary whips the crowd into a frenzy UNknown to her performance in front of the rich sons
the gong UNknown is a tribune for the performance in which not only she takes part but an UNknown UNknown
in a later scene the movement UNknown and reversed we will see them empty crashing down
in the beginning only men were present here now we see women the workers wives female workers
at the start the workers silently waiting for the raising of the UNknown now the unleashed mass men and women UNknown determined to blow it up
the children abandoned by their biological fathers and mothers offered for adoption by mary the maternal and freder the brother
again two people two UNknown UNknown audio UNknown bound by the video telephone in fredersen 's office control and command tool of the ruler of metropolis
UNknown and superior
the two UNknown now in parallel action the true the white finally free to continue her reconciliation work
and the false the red the force behind uprising and destruction
mary on her way to the city of the workers to save the children abandoned by their fathers and mothers
like a counter manoeuvre to her own creation by rotwang as a light show electric UNknown sorcery the false mary UNknown the destruction of the heart machine
before leaving the stage via a back stairway a shadow UNknown a staircase exit to another theatre another audience the sons of the rich
arm movements as though in UNknown of the UNknown of the disk still identifying with the machine even during its destruction
the elevators now finally descending UNknown
deep under the city there wanders a stream joh fredersen constructed a path for the stream when he built the city of the workers
now the unleashed waters of the depths join the uprising of the humans
we have seen rotwang working the UNknown in his laboratory and the other mary working the UNknown of the heart machine
now she is moving the UNknown of the gong machine
the gong UNknown the alarm clock the tribune UNknown the revolt is now used to save the children
the square fills with the water and the children
no more doubt
not just a couple but three a trinity of which there soon will be more with UNknown members
they take care of the children the innocent offspring of the workers who have refused to be rescued by them
a last climb through the UNknown from the depths of the workers city to the club of the sons
the flying camera UNknown the pressure of the explosion which rocks the city to its foundations
finale with mary 's theme
general pause then again the theme of the uprising men and women dancing in two UNknown circles as though still under the spell of the machines they destroyed
four actually five UNknown and actions with various characters are now UNknown
fredersen 's office
this question is UNknown answered
by a UNknown from the mechanical woman 's theme
UNknown the yoshiwara where to a UNknown the false mary
leads the sons of the rich to dance on the volcano
the workers abandon the scene of action
UNknown the entrance of the club of the sons
and the children
and finally UNknown rotwang 's attic room where fredersen 's down and out opponent recovers
this plot of UNknown UNknown again proved too complicated for the UNknown they UNknown they UNknown
they edited the film giving the impression that the false mary is the only victim of the witch hunt and that the true mary is in no danger
by UNknown this shot the true mary becomes the other
only when you carefully look you see here !
mary running across the screen escaping from her UNknown who manage to couple her double
UNknown the workers construct a stake in front of the cathedral
the stake is made from metal the wrecks of cars partly with their headlights UNknown
the false mary tied to the stake
she who was created by electrical sparks totally in her element in a display of UNknown lust
UNknown and freder separated
but he knew he had died
and this UNknown filled him with the deepest satisfaction
he only wanted his hel
upon finding hel he would no longer have reason to quarrel with anything on earth
hel he says in the novel
i am not a ghost although i have died i had to die to come to you
mary the virgin and her double both in mortal danger a mirror image in one scene
the red mary at the stake the white in the cathedral pursued by rotwang
the bells of the cathedral come to her aid
UNknown the saviour
as freder watches the fire burns away the flesh of the false mary revealing her mechanical core UNknown triumphant accompanied by one of the mechanical woman UNknown in UNknown major
the scene on the cathedral roof is UNknown of victor hugo 's
hunchback of notre dame
an unmistakable reference the UNknown
after the demise of the evil half of the female double pair the final battle between the two male rivals is UNknown on the roof of the cathedral
freder the naive fool has learnt through his passion to UNknown between truth and lies
then in the face of the needs of the children he has ripened to an active person now he is capable of dealing with his UNknown
fredersen kneeling he too UNknown through suffering
slim and UNknown another antagonistic pair unite to offer him assistance
and finally UNknown the foreman less class conscious than loyal to his rulers
in UNknown 's gravity 's rainbow p UNknown remembers how rotwang carried mary onto the roof of the cathedral
he was taken by klein UNknown playing the mad inventor who he himself and his fellow students would have loved to be
mary fredersen 's mother hel
in UNknown 's screenplay mary acting on an appeal from the workers wives calls on freder to be a mediator
in the film as shot by lang the women retreat totally into the underground and background the women retreat totally into the underground and background
for the finale the mediator theme
the rest is dealt with by the chiefs the representatives of state and people of capital and labour
the social partners still require mutual trust
they need a mediator removed from the parties interests
mary as a woman is permitted to deliver the cue
thus completing her task
the interpretation is part of the film 's story even if UNknown bizarre and excessive
from that time onward more than a quarter of the film was assumed to have been lost
then in UNknown a virtually complete version of the film was discovered in buenos aires
what had been preserved was however a heavily damaged copy of the film that had been printed to UNknown film stock
lacking the full frame of the picture 's original aspect ratio
a considerable amount of the film reconstruction was able to be completed and the correct sequence of its editing established by means of this UNknown material
spanish UNknown have been translated into german with the aid of the censor cards
in order to display in their correct position on the image the UNknown elements taken from the UNknown negative the missing portion of the frame has been marked by black
the UNknown appear with their original UNknown treatment

city of the workers
which of you ladies shall today have the honour of entertaining master freder joh fredersen 's son ?
who was that ?
to the new tower of babel to my father !
why is it UNknown that i learn of this explosion from my son and not from you !
i wanted to look into the faces of the people whose little children are my brothers my sisters
your magnificent city father and you the brain of this city and all of us within the light of this city
and where are the people father whose hands built your city ?
off where they belong
in the depths ?
the chief foreman of the heart machine UNknown with an important message
there were two more copies of those UNknown plans herr fredersen
in the pockets of two men who met with an accident today at the m machine
how is it UNknown that these plans were brought to me by UNknown rather than by you ?
apply to the g bank for your remaining wages
father do you know what it means to be dismissed by you ?
into the depths !
would you like to come with me UNknown ?
go home UNknown and wait for me
i still have a long way to go tonight
into the depths to my brothers
from today on i wish to be kept precisely informed of my son 's every move
there will be someone at the machine
the man who UNknown within was rotwang the inventor
lost to joh fredersen
a mind like yours rotwang should be able to forget
only one time in life did i forget something that hel was a woman and you a man
let the dead lie rotwang
she 's dead for you as she is for me
for me she isn 't dead joh fredersen for me she lives !
do you think the loss of a hand is too high a price for UNknown hel ? !
do you wish to see her ? !
now joh fredersen ? !
isn 't it worth losing a hand to have created the man of the future the machine man ? !
24 more hours of work and no man joh fredersen will be able to UNknown the machine man from a mortal !
the woman is mine joh fredersen !
hel 's son was yours !
and what brings you my way joh fredersen ?
i need your advice as usual when all my experts fail me
can you UNknown for me these plans that for months have been getting discovered in the pockets of my workers ?
at two once my shift ends !
she has summoned us again
it 's a blueprint of the two thousand year old UNknown deep below the lowest levels of your metropolis
i should like to UNknown what my workers are doing exactly in those UNknown
today i shall tell you the legend of the UNknown of the tower of babel
the legend of the UNknown of the tower of babel
and at the tower 's zenith we shall write
great is the world and its maker !
and great is man !
but those who had conceived of the tower of babel could not build the tower of babel
the task was too great
so they paid wages to outside hands
but the hands that built the tower of babel knew nothing of the dream of which the head that had conceived it had been UNknown
the hymns of praise of one man became the curses of others
the same language was spoken but these men did not understand one another
great is the world and its maker and great is man
head and hands require a mediator
the UNknown between head and hands must be the heart !
and where is our mediator maria ?
wait for him !
we will wait maria !
but not for much longer !
oh mediator have you finally come
you summoned me here i am !
rotwang give the machine man the likeness of this woman
i shall sow discord between them and her !
i shall destroy their belief in this woman
leave me alone now joh fredersen
you UNknown l find the way back without me
you fool !
until tomorrow in the cathedral !
end of the prelude
verily i say unto you the days of which the UNknown speaks draw nigh !
the monk 's hand points to the bible in which it is written
and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns
and the woman was UNknown in purple and scarlet colour having a golden cup in her hand
and upon her forehead was a name written a mystery
babylon the great the mother of UNknown ofthe earth
and i saw the woman drunken with the blood ofthe saints
you will UNknown joh fredersen him and his city and his son !
i now beg of you stay away from me and my beloved !
where is the one whose clothes you are wearing ?
he must lead me to the workers city at once
i have to have someone who 's faithful to me UNknown otherwise how shall i attain the end goal of my path ? !
i must go on UNknown must now on my own seek out the person to whom UNknown was supposed to lead me
tonight UNknown tonight when i come back
you still don 't seem to have UNknown who sent me here
central bank of UNknown
in three hours time i shall be calling for you !
where is maria ? !
she 's with your father
i 'm telling you she is with your father !
she is the most perfect and most obedient tool that a man has ever possessed !
tonight you shall see how she holds up before the eyes ofthe upper hundred
you shall see her dance and if only one single person UNknown the machine in her
i will call myself a UNknown who never succeeded at anything !
i want you to go to those in the depths in order to UNknown the work of your UNknown !
c a rotwang requests herr joh fredersen to be his guest this evening
verily i say unto you the days of which the UNknown speaks draw nigh !
all seven deadly sins on her behalf !
death UNknown the city !
end of the UNknown
i escaped from the thin man wearing this attire
but for ten days your father 's bloodhound has been making the workers city UNknown
the only thing keeping the workers in check is their expectation for the mediator promised unto them
even stranger things have been happening freder
on that evening when you fell ill
once the best of friends because of that woman
the other man on that same evening
the eternal gardens lie abandoned but night after night in yoshiwara
and this woman at whose feet all sins are UNknown is also called maria
that same woman that those in the depths regard as a saint ? !
many now go to the city of the dead to a woman they have judged to be as true as gold
the mediator is not likely to miss that occasion
whatever happens tonight it is my express order to allow the workers to do as they please
joh fredersen wants to let those in the depths use force and do wrong so that he can claim the right to use force against them
when you spoke to your poor brothers you talked about peace maria today a mouthpiece of joh fredersen UNknown them to rebel against him
she will destroy their belief in the mediator !
you know i UNknown e always talked about peace but your mediator hasn 't come
you UNknown e waited long enough !
your time has come !
but i UNknown e tricked joh fredersen !
your UNknown does not obey his will only mine alone !
who is the living fodder for the machines for metropolis ? !
who UNknown the machine joints with their own UNknown ? !
who feeds the machines with their own flesh ? !
let the machines starve you fools !
finish them off ! !
do them in these machines ! !
you aren 't maria ! ! !
you are not UNknown !
maria talks of peace not murder !
this is not maria ! !
joh fredersen 's son ! !
do him in the dog in his white silken hide ! ! !
get your women your sons out of the workers city !
let no one stay behind !
death to the machines ! ! !
in the attic of his home
rotwang UNknown for maria his ever growing UNknown with his triumph over fredersen and twice over did i trick joh fredersen !
for i concealed from him that his son wants to be the mediator of your brothers and is in love with you !
maria isn 't the only one listening to rotwang
on the other side of the attic 's window joh fredersen was eavesdropping
joh fredersen breaks into rotwang 's attic
he UNknown with his old rival and UNknown him
maria is free
women and men let no one miss out on today !
death to the machines ! !
not one man not one woman has stayed behind !
leave the machines !
to the heart machine !
if the heart machine UNknown nothing in the machine district will be left standing ! !
have you lost your minds ??
if the heart machine UNknown the entire workers city will be laid to waste ! !
where are your fathers your mothers ?
do you have any idea that your son is amongst the workers ? !
yes you !
to the air shafts quickly !
the city is drowning !
we UNknown l take the children to the sons club !
why are all the lights out ?
i need to know !
where is my son ? ! ! !
tomorrow thousands will ask in fury and desperation
joh fredersen where is my son ? !
where are your children ?? !
the city is drowned the shafts are totally flooded ! !
who bade you attack the machines without which you 'r e finished you idiots ?? !
it 's the witch 's fault !
we UNknown l be looking on as the world goes to the devil !
find the witch ; this is all her fault !
strike her dead ! !
now i 'm going to take you home my hel !
the witch ! the witch !
there she is ! there she is !
where are our children you witch you ?? !
burn the witch to the stake with her ! ! !
to the stake with her ! !
head and hands want to join together but they don 't have the heart to do it
oh mediator show them the way to one another
the UNknown between head and hands must be the heart !

soon they won 't need humans anymore
i 'm kenichi
nice to meet you
from this day forward it can be said that this is the birth of a 1000 year nation
i 'm thrilled to have the honour of announcing the UNknown of mankind 's scientific achievement !
our power will shine across the world across the universe !
may you be eternal !
our ziggurat !
don 't you have an easier name ?
we are not given names like people
some fear it would UNknown on human rights
oh i know !
yeah it 's the name of a dog i had
he was a fine dog !
in my opinion i believe there is no place for a criminal to hide in metropolis
what are you talking about ?
i heard he 's here
if dr laughton is in hiding he is UNknown in zone 1
zone 1 ?
that 's your detective 's intuition ?
just a matter of probability calculated by my electronic brain
we robots each have our own occupation
our activities are restricted accordingly
that robot was prohibited from any activity at surface level
but who are those people dressed like fascists ?
the UNknown party
traffic between levels is limited according to rank
people and robots not marked for certain UNknown may come and go
so that robot we saw was marked ?
such a system shouldn 't exist anyway !
well well i suppose light creates shadows
this level is still not that dangerous but depending on the location there are areas without police so be careful
that 's all right
hurry up and come home !
where in the world did that child go ? !
i was outside for a while so i wasn 't at home
where 'd you go ?
i UNknown e come back with some stories
she looks perfect
well her fuel system is not stable so
did you use organic machinery ?
not at all !
organic machinery is a quick fix but it doesn 't last long
i UNknown e created her from mechanical parts
she is the greatest work of my life !
when will she be complete ?
within the week
my little tima
i UNknown l put the finishing touches on now and you 'r e gonna escape with me
i know you
how 'd you find my lab ?
guarding father is one of my many duties
wasn 't the child he lost a girl ?
shut up !
you 'r e trying to trick father with your technology !
a mere puppet like this could never touch father 's heart
what are you gonna do ?
i am working on tima at duke red 's request !
he has plans for her
the last piece for the ziggurat
he will place her on the throne !
that 's a lie !
father would never have a mere robot rule the ziggurat !
then ask him yourself
knowing that your father is waiting for his little angel ?
i won 't allow father to be seduced by a robot !
oh god give me courage !
give me the strength to guard my father from the evil machines !
a fire !
there 's a fire !
a fire !
i saw him with my own eyes !
i saw him !
atlas is right !
take up your weapons !
now is the time to fight !
everyone please calm down
it 's dangerous here !
please evacuate !
we lost our jobs because of you bastards !
and now you 'r e giving orders !
this is no time to be fighting !
what the ? !
an old guy was always coming and going from there
is this the guy ?
yeah that 's him
oh my goodness !
it was an experiment
everything was lost
they found his remains
what 's wrong ?
shut up !
we got rid of something we didn 't need
something 's wrong
its skeleton should UNknown e remained
who is that man ?
rock of the UNknown party
he 's young but he 's influential
they say that duke red trusts him
duke red ?
duke red is the founder of the party
they appear to be UNknown but their UNknown comes from duke red
it 's a secret but they do it so openly everyone knows about it
where does this sewage go ?
it dumps into zone 2 up ahead and goes to a disposal plant in zone 3
if they got that far they won 't be alive
they 'd be treated as waste
a normal human will always return to the site of the crime
people had some good UNknown back then
let us carefully look for mr kenichi again
who in the world are you ?
who in the world are you ?
who am l ?
who am i ?
your name your home and your mother and father
that 's how you eat it
oh no !
radiation mechanism fixing final position
radiation time is three minutes
it won 't affect humans but robots working on the surface may UNknown
we will record everything
start at level 3
UNknown UNknown at 800 and still rising
there is a disturbance in earth 's UNknown
level 3 radiation complete
the world will be in an uproar over this
after all you have the power of god in the palm of your hand
if dr laughton finished tima she now could have taken the throne
it 's a new weapon sir
it creates UNknown that UNknown the earth in radiation
how dare they develop such a thing on their own ?
it changes the balance of power !
even with the UNknown hunting the robots the rebels are screaming for human rights UNknown citizens by UNknown change in robot laws
even civilian groups in favour of robots are protesting causing minor UNknown
this is a golden opportunity !
we could put the law for treason to good use
do we have control of the military ?
some units are UNknown with duke red but it should be fine
all right leak some stories
stir up UNknown duke red sentiment then we will have him arrested
if you meet any resistance UNknown the military !
i believe that he 's the one who killed laughton !
i don 't understand the connection between him and laughton
what in the world was laughton experimenting on i wonder ?
what do you intend to do ?
now that laughton 's been killed i should report why he was killed
it 's the least i can do for my client
where does he think he 's going ?
zone 2 i believe
what is up with this city ?
zone 2 is the area for metropolis power plants
zone 3 below that is the sewage disposal plant
sewage disposal plant ?
i UNknown l go to headquarters and get permission to go below
i UNknown l also submit a search request for kenichi
how much ?
the administration keeps a sharp watch
how often are you down here ?
twice a week
these are the albert ii models
they 'r e the last group to get inspected

you heard him he 's a reporter
he can let the world know about metropolis
that 's more than we could have hoped for
it 's a time of life or death
we have no time to get our pictures taken !
but we UNknown e got the right to choose how we die
i want to die as a revolutionary
hey look at that
yeah she 's an angel
around here two or three families live to a room
no schools and no work either
we live on rations but with the celebration for the ziggurat we don 't even get those
what does ziggurat mean ?
it 's the name of a tower built in babylon
the most famous was the tower of babel
you know what happened to that
the king of babylon UNknown the gods and it was destroyed
but history repeats itself
and this time we UNknown l destroy it not the gods
did i make a mistake ?
no that 's not it
just that your hair has grown
what kind of hair do you like ?
come on let 's practice
okay next is
thank you kenichi
most of the underground is in favour of action but everyone 's UNknown
we 'r e UNknown of our strength
the last celebration for the ziggurat begins with the UNknown parade
that 's when we UNknown l crush them and i want you to storm the ziggurat
the president will make an announcement that duke red 's been arrested for treason
we UNknown l invoke the right of command and place the military under president boon
with that metropolis will have a normal government

a human ?
where is he ?
if you don 't know anything about kenichi then i 'm going back now
hang in there laughton !
don 't worry

and that 's where i 'm going to need your help
if you connect to the ziggurat 's network you can find out where he is
i can do that ?
now try putting out your hand
how was it ?
inside the tower
what did i just do ?
oh that 's right
what do you mean ?
duke red ?
the power was so intense the line UNknown was burnt out
found it !
please tell me
or am i ?
no i 'm a human
a human just like kenichi
we UNknown e been searching for you
where were you going ?
explain or i UNknown l have you arrested for kidnapping !
you 'r e asking the wrong man !
ask your son if you want the real answer
i don 't know what you 'r e up to but i believe you were definitely working with dr laughton
and his murder was probably UNknown by you or rock
to keep your secret
soon you will rule the entire world from here
i will ?
you will soon understand
it 's me !
he 's not dying
i UNknown l submit a protest through my embassy regarding this !
it UNknown l be a diplomatic crisis !
you have my most sincere apology
but no matter where you are from everyone will bow before tima
she 's growing the way we estimated
make kenichi the way he was
what 's wrong tima ?
who cares about a little boy ?
you possess the power to rule the entire world
what is my power ?
am i a human ?
or am i a machine just like those poor robots ?
what a silly thing to say !
how could you be like those pieces of junk ?
then i am human same as kenichi ?
what are you saying ? !
you are no mere human !
you are not inferior ruled by emotions confused by love and morality
you are a superhuman !
then i really am
it is true you are a robot
you are the greatest most sublime creation ever !
that is a lie
you are still not complete
you just need time
one day you UNknown l UNknown with that superhuman throne and become a computer weapon that UNknown l rule the world !
then all your emotions and memories will be completely erased !
and where did you get that information ?
i 'm still a detective
it 's time to change miss tima
father please open your eyes
how in the ?
you must sit on that throne
you are the only one that can be our leader father
what are you ?
i am an artificial human
a machine created to ruin the world
no not to ruin !
to rebuild !
it just started by itself !
switch to manual and cut the power !
controls are not responding !
dr UNknown !
the generator is out of control !
what 's going on doctor ?
this is punishment for fooling with robots
tima 's memories are UNknown with our UNknown
she 's beginning to go crazy
and god 's wrath descended on the tower of babel
don 't !
all right i understand
in one hour the probability of mankind 's survival will be 30
i control the ziggurat and all earth UNknown will be UNknown within 30 minutes
oh my goodness !
destruction of humans through UNknown and weapons will occur in 17 hours and 27 minutes
did you hear that duke red ?
your superhuman is saying it has no need for humans !
don 't go !
how can this be ?
get out !
tima it 's me !
tima grab my hand !
i 'm kenichi
who in the world are you ?
hurry grab my hand !
who am i ?
who am i ?
few other films have been so systematically changed mutilated corrupted as this one
shots and titles have been omitted and changed
however of no other such UNknown film do we know so well what the film originally looked like
fritz lang and thea von UNknown different sex siamese twins
just like their film
at this point the music started during the first screening
the metropolis theme
thea von UNknown 's message lang didn 't believe in it
metropolis the mother city city of mothers mother of all cities
the city the film they too are machines
UNknown a UNknown an eccentric disk
a machine without workers devoid of function pure movement UNknown UNknown a machine of desire
round shapes and jerking movements become one within the image of two clocks
one 12 hour and one 10 hour clock
day shift and night shift 10 hours each mark the metropolis working day
two groups of workers UNknown in rows of six march in unison the exhausted half as fast as the fresh
they moved their feet but were not walking reads the novel
the way people move or are moved is always highly significant throughout the film
the workers theme a funeral march
the night shift enters a cage the grate is raised the cage sinks and with it the camera
a title picks up the movement
even the titles the young luis bu UNknown wrote in his review of the film
how they rise and fall blend with the movement as a whole become pictures themselves
the title 's movement is carried through to the movement of the picture
elevators transport the workers up and down between the machine halls and their living quarters
a new musical theme
the main square of the workers city
simply a transit area for the workers returning to their quarters
in the centre a gong again a kind of alarm clock
the downward scroll of the title is answered by a rising UNknown triangle pointing UNknown
an artificial grotto columns like UNknown young women in UNknown carnival costumes
orient inspired head UNknown
in contrast to the straight course of the young men animated turns UNknown directed by a UNknown UNknown
a playground is the pleasure garden of the sons an UNknown UNknown
nature sex UNknown in chaste UNknown
like the water in the fountain
a transparent dome UNknown a statue of a siren
the youth in white breeches and the girl with the UNknown de paris play hide and seek
their game a dance a pas de deux
UNknown yet so intensely innocent that we do not actually expect a real kiss
instead an UNknown glance UNknown accompanied by a new theme let us call it the love theme
answered by an apparition dressed in light grey it reads in the screenplay
from the smallest of d UNknown s rises a head with solemn eyes and glowing blonde hair
the UNknown countenance of the virgin the sweet countenance of the mother reads the novel
the mother without a man
freder 's dream
the subject of her glance is freder the brother the son of fredersen the nothing more than son
all names in metropolis are UNknown in meaning
UNknown by the clarinet a new UNknown based theme which from now on will accompany the entrances of the young woman
a door closes communication is interrupted
this will be repeated at several decisive moments throughout the film providing the UNknown for further action on the part of its UNknown
nothing could help him nothing the novel states at this point
in a UNknown UNknown UNknown stood before his eyes the vision a countenance
the UNknown countenance of the virgin the sweet countenance of the mother
later we learn that freder lost his mother at birth
not in the workers city as one would think
freder arrives in a machine hall
in the novel he now comes face to face with a machine of his own construction
he strokes it feels its limbs presses his face to its bulk
in the film the machine is also a living organism
freder in the novel
blood pressure and temperature of the film machine rise
perhaps i will feel your trembling and the UNknown of pulse in your rigid body
perhaps i shall experience the UNknown with which you UNknown yourself into your vast element bearing me the man who made you
but freder also knows freder in the novel
nothing in this world is more UNknown than the jealousy of a machine that feels neglected
in the film the machine is called the m machine
m as in mother ?
m as in UNknown
the film of the future is also a film of UNknown a biblical film
UNknown the god of the UNknown to whom the UNknown also sacrificed children to the UNknown of moses and his god
the film is UNknown with UNknown to the old and new UNknown
in the music the UNknown theme switches to the theme of the workers city
UNknown of workers in rows of six march into the mouth of UNknown which UNknown back into the machine
in the music the fredersen theme UNknown him as a self confident UNknown
joh fredersen joh with h
than he was once again a boy of ten
nothing more than the son of this father
the music the UNknown theme tells us what freder is speaking about
the gestures of the son unlike those of the father display trust seek contact
fredersen looks past him his gaze rests on the secretary
fredersen 's glances are orders as are his words his gestures
camera movements are rare in metropolis and are always significant
here the camera is guided by the movements of the actors the pace of the discussion moves the camera stops it moves it on first it UNknown
then it pans with father and son
it is in the children not the adults that freder UNknown his siblings himself as the infant UNknown of the virgin the motherly a kind of infant jesus
fredersen is not only ruler but also builder of metropolis
his city an UNknown dream a dazzling UNknown city UNknown UNknown UNknown as the urban UNknown the new tower of babel
first from the strings then the horns UNknown UNknown marcia the theme of the uprising begins
a video telephone on the wall behind
fredersen 's office is the control communication and command centre
his power is based on information
above fredersen on the wall the lower edge of the 10 hour clock is now visible
fredersen 's power lies in his ability to control the time of his UNknown
the worker the capitalist the clerk the model of modern class society
the position of the seemingly privileged employee is in fact the most UNknown
again a door closes behind somebody this person 's disappearance UNknown freder to dedicate himself to this person
again freder runs
for the father the door closes behind him
fredersen in right profile
take note of just how differently
lang stages dialogue
and again in an act of UNknown
once again he is confronted with the spectacle of a machine
in the novel it is called the UNknown machine so let 's keep it so it keeps the elevator system in the new tower of babel moving
in the film it has no obvious function it is purely UNknown
an UNknown machine if you like
the change of clothing UNknown freder 's rebellion against the father
this is the beginning of the UNknown of the son of jehovah his passion
this cut is up to now the most serious intervention carried out by the UNknown
the critic roland UNknown praised the missing sequence
then from a far distance came rotwang and UNknown great resistance took it for his own
the rotwang musical theme is UNknown of the UNknown music
fredersen is the only person in metropolis who respects rotwang 's genius
the removal of this figure is the UNknown UNknown executed by the UNknown
the hel of the UNknown UNknown was the ruler of the underworld motherly goddess of death
in hel rotwang has lost his lover
fredersen his wife
how lang stages a dramatic dialogue
fredersen in right profile
fredersen in right profile rotwang in left profile
the audience UNknown at times UNknown at times UNknown observer
curtain up for rotwang 's first scene the entry of the mechanical woman the new hel
on the wall a UNknown the magical symbol the tip pointing UNknown suggests the UNknown
a metallic UNknown with female physical UNknown with breasts and on the UNknown mounted and UNknown the UNknown
the music echoes the most important UNknown of the mechanical woman theme
it UNknown three UNknown UNknown to the various aspects of the being and which at times appear separately at times in unison
rotwang 's artificial limb is steel steel from the steel of the creature to whom he sacrificed his hand
another parallel scene freder still at the machine
fredersen with rotwang UNknown the next sequence
rotwang 's library ancient UNknown and a neon UNknown lamp rotwang caught between middle ages and future
fredersen in contrast with a UNknown tre UNknown on his wrist is the UNknown of twenties UNknown
freder 's passion the factory is his UNknown his cross the clock the father god 's instrument of power
the UNknown is not UNknown
lack of information is the UNknown for fredersen 's departure
for the first time we see him physically in motion moving from one scene to another
fredersen and rotwang descend from right to left
left right the workers freder between them
both groups heading towards the same scene
mother look at me !
both UNknown of the plot UNknown in rotwang 's and fredersen 's glance down into the crypt
they do not recognise freder in the scene
the preacher is reciting a screenplay
which freder turns into a film for us
the creative man priest ruler architect
accompanied by the music played during the opening credits of the film
what here looks like a UNknown construction in UNknown shot turns out to be a model around which a group of UNknown has gathered
new to the music
five groups of workers a UNknown
like the fingers on a hand
end of the UNknown the sermon end of the projection
a look into the camera into our eyes
thus we learn her name
in the novel freder asks
what should i call you ?
UNknown UNknown marcia
fredersen believes he has seen enough
what rotwang sees however and wants to prevent fredersen from seeing because a new plan is UNknown in his mind
a dialogue is opening
his hand UNknown her
UNknown her gaze sweeps her gaze directly into the camera
moving gently to him UNknown both in the picture the speaker always in UNknown profile the UNknown UNknown from behind
an erotic dialogue regardless of what the titles say
the love theme is playing
now stops and is replaced by the rotwang and fredersen UNknown in UNknown variations
the couple is UNknown threatened by the theme of the uprising
will rotwang give up his project to recreate hel or will he extend it if it can be used to steal his rival 's son from him
the son of hel who he himself expected from her ?
mary 's light is candlelight natural soft like her
the realm of death the realm of hel
is freder 's dead mother jealous of her son 's love is this why she joins forces with her destroyer ?
rotwang 's lamp is a mechanical tool like his steel hand the entire man a UNknown of man and machine
lucifer the UNknown of light is one of the evil one 's names
he showed this scene to a hollywood specialist wrote lang
they just did not think of it and
light and shadow should not only be used to convey a mood but should also play a decisive role in the action
UNknown gothic grandeur ceremony incense it says in the screenplay
in the centre of the scene a column reaching towards the heavens
like the trunk of a palm in the novel the cathedral UNknown a fanatical sect the UNknown who persistently offer fredersen resistance
the UNknown of the film reduced this strand of the plot even more
again a parallel action which interferes in the current action UNknown it into a UNknown
the music in the cathedral scene
the dies UNknown musical UNknown for death and disaster
in the original version of the film the musical UNknown is UNknown with the memory of the UNknown sermon of the monk at the cathedral
this is the longest piece to have been cut from the film
the story of freder the good boy
rotwang the sorcerer and the abducted mary gives metropolis the air of a UNknown in a particularly UNknown way
many UNknown are based on the abduction of a person
the hero the UNknown is shown the way
like the trail of a scent says the novel
the glow in front of him led him up the stairs
the old house sucks freder in it makes him its prisoner it draws him into the depths
the machinery of the old house is like a model of the UNknown mechanism which keeps both hero and audience moving always being shown something before it quickly disappears again
a vision a staging
rotwang 's laboratory was half a quack 's kitchen from the year 1500 and half experimental laboratory of a man from the year 2000
in rotwang 's character UNknown and lang UNknown both magic and UNknown in one UNknown
a UNknown like the film in which he appears
that could have been conceived and staged by him just like the transformation of the mechanical woman into the image of mary
his staging UNknown both feminine and masculine form and movement translated into a spectacle of light
a UNknown act of UNknown
rotwang 's experimental table with mary as snow white waiting in her glass coffin to be awakened can be seen as the couch of rotwang the psychoanalyst
her subconscious UNknown itself in the UNknown of light stretching between her and the mechanical woman
freder like awakening from a nightmare sees himself in another one
hel 's room her memorial is behind the curtain
mary 's theme UNknown in a minor key
the false mary flesh of the flesh of the true mary while at the same time a remote controlled machine at the core
why is fredersen so UNknown determined to destroy the true mary ?
in the figure of the merciful preacher he seems to sense a female challenge
that of UNknown to his UNknown principle of absolute power
freder 's UNknown experience
at this point in the novel freder chokes his father
i want to kill you !
i want to destroy you !
i want to murder you !
in the film a fall UNknown into the depth into the UNknown of his subconscious
freder in bed the father in tails
an obvious feeling of helplessness in front of his father 's aura of authority
the son remains in the care of the in part female staff
a sick child
can it be that freder and rotwang are not so much rivals as the alter UNknown of each other ?
they love the same woman the dead hel
the absence of the mother the lover provides the inspiration for freder 's visions just as much as for rotwang 's UNknown
rotwang 's audience consists entirely of men old and young fathers and sons
like a blasphemous halo says the screenplay the UNknown on the woman 's head appears in the round opening of the UNknown roof that fades out
rotwang 's show is a film another of rotwang 's light productions with footlights and counter lighting
rotwang 's show and freder 's delirium become one
an important strand in this UNknown freder 's UNknown of the monk 's UNknown in the cathedral has again been cut by the UNknown
UNknown from the action which was shown
isolated edited gestures and the positions of the dancer combined with the picture of the audience
groups singles only eyes finally
rotwang 's production becomes lang 's pure UNknown cinema
rotwang 's show now clearly becomes freder 's vision the memory of the seven deadly sins in the cathedral
of the monk 's sermon on the whore of babylon which he associates with the image of the false mary the new hel the mother whore
which becomes one with that of the metropolis the mother city
freder convalescent is reading
again two parallel scenes the second once more cut by the UNknown
the spy reports to the father the friend to the son
nothing remains of this scene but screenplay and score
lead to the assumption that these takes were repeated here
fredersen gives slim an order
a third reporting situation is UNknown in after the other two
rotwang tells mary
like the group of rich sons in the dancehall the group of workers in the UNknown too fall under the spell of the vamp
like the evil character in a fairy tale rotwang pretends his own child to be the one he keeps as a prisoner
UNknown regarded the red mary 's speech as inciting and ordered a UNknown form for the second version
instead of the title became
who wants to work himself to death for the rulers of metropolis ?
instead of in the UNknown version it became
who are the slaves of metropolis ?
and for the false mary had to say
let them rot
he sees through the double
the UNknown found the construction with rotwang 's report as the UNknown around the second UNknown scene too complicated
UNknown 's UNknown not only seals freder 's new role as a critical UNknown but also shows him as a future saviour as a new messiah
the central square of the workers city has become a stage in the theatre of the revolution
the first beats of the marseillaise
not only the music is UNknown with the character of a citation
the way the false mary whips the crowd into a frenzy UNknown to her performance in front of the rich sons
the gong UNknown is a tribune for the performance in which not only she takes part but an UNknown UNknown
in a later scene the movement UNknown and reversed we will see them empty crashing down
in the beginning only men were present here now we see women the workers wives female workers
at the start the workers silently waiting for the raising of the UNknown now the unleashed mass men and women UNknown determined to blow it up
the children abandoned by their biological fathers and mothers offered for adoption by mary the maternal and freder the brother
again two people two UNknown UNknown audio UNknown bound by the video telephone in fredersen 's office control and command tool of the ruler of metropolis
UNknown and superior
the two UNknown now in parallel action
the true the white finally free to continue her reconciliation work
and the false the red the force behind uprising and destruction
mary on her way to the city of the workers to save the children abandoned by their fathers and mothers
like a counter manoeuvre to her own creation by rotwang as a light show electric UNknown sorcery the false mary UNknown the destruction of the heart machine
before leaving the stage via a back stairway a shadow UNknown a staircase exit to another theatre another audience the sons of the rich
arm movements as though in UNknown of the UNknown of the disk still identifying with the machine even during its destruction
the elevators now finally descending UNknown
deep under the city there wanders a stream joh fredersen constructed a path for the stream when he built the city of the workers
now the unleashed waters of the depths join the uprising of the humans
we have seen rotwang working the UNknown in his laboratory and the other mary working the UNknown of the heart machine
now she is moving the UNknown of the gong machine
the gong UNknown the alarm clock the tribune UNknown the revolt is now used to save the children
the square fills with the water and the children
no more doubt
not just a couple but three a trinity of which there soon will be more with UNknown members
they take care of the children the innocent offspring of the workers who have refused to be rescued by them
a last climb through the UNknown from the depths of the workers city to the club of the sons
the flying camera UNknown the pressure of the explosion which rocks the city to its foundations
finale with mary 's theme
general pause then again the theme of the uprising men and women dancing in two UNknown circles as though still under the spell of the machines they destroyed
four actually five UNknown and actions with various characters are now UNknown
fredersen 's office
this question is UNknown answered
by a UNknown from the mechanical woman 's theme
UNknown the yoshiwara where to a UNknown the false mary
leads the sons of the rich to dance on the volcano
the workers abandon the scene of action
UNknown the entrance of the club of the sons
and the children
and finally UNknown rotwang 's attic room where fredersen 's down and out opponent recovers
this plot of UNknown UNknown again proved too complicated for the UNknown they UNknown they UNknown
they edited the film giving the impression that the false mary is the only victim of the witch hunt and that the true mary is in no danger
by UNknown this shot the true mary becomes the other
only when you carefully look you see here !
mary running across the screen escaping from her UNknown who manage to couple her double
UNknown the workers construct a stake in front of the cathedral
the stake is made from metal the wrecks of cars partly with their headlights UNknown
the false mary tied to the stake
she who was created by electrical sparks totally in her element in a display of UNknown lust
UNknown and freder separated
but he knew he had died
and this UNknown filled him with the deepest satisfaction
he only wanted his hel
upon finding hel he would no longer have reason to quarrel with anything on earth
hel he says in the novel
i am not a ghost although i have died i had to die to come to you
mary the virgin and her double both in mortal danger a mirror image in one scene
the red mary at the stake the white in the cathedral pursued by rotwang
the bells of the cathedral come to her aid
UNknown the saviour
as freder watches the fire burns away the flesh of the false mary revealing her mechanical core UNknown triumphant accompanied by one of the mechanical woman UNknown in UNknown major
the scene on the cathedral roof is UNknown of victor hugo 's
hunchback of notre dame
an unmistakable reference
freder the naive fool has learnt through his passion to UNknown between truth and lies
then in the face of the needs of the children he has ripened to an active person now he is capable of dealing with his UNknown
fredersen kneeling he too UNknown through suffering
slim and UNknown another antagonistic pair unite to offer him assistance
and finally UNknown the foreman less class conscious than loyal to his rulers
in UNknown 's gravity 's rainbow p UNknown remembers how rotwang carried mary onto the roof of the cathedral
he was taken by klein UNknown playing the mad inventor who he himself and his fellow students would have loved to be
mary fredersen 's mother hel
in UNknown 's screenplay mary acting on an appeal from the workers wives calls on freder to be a mediator
in the film as shot by lang the women retreat totally into the underground and background
the women retreat totally into the underground and background
for the finale
the rest is dealt with by the chiefs the representatives of state and people of capital and labour
the social partners still require mutual trust
they need a mediator removed from the parties interests
mary as a woman is permitted to deliver the cue
thus completing her task
the interpretation is part of the film 's story even if UNknown bizarre and excessive
one of them kept it at a price

why would he have cut it ?
why do you wear men 's clothing ?
if we give you women 's clothing would you wear it ?
when the mission that god has entrusted to me is over
i will again dress as a woman
so it is god who orders you to dress as a man ?
and what reward do you expect from god ?
the salvation of my soul
you UNknown god
has god made you promises ?
that has nothing to do with this trial
shouldn 't we let the judges decide that ?

lieutenant UNknown had found for georgette a job in the canteen
the dorm 's UNknown aroma !
evening intimacy !
if they find your dummy i UNknown l be the one on detention again
unaware of the barracks custom
georgette UNknown came to say goodnight to her dear joseph
corporal count your men
i 'd rather skip the birds tonight
here 's the colonel !
it 's the colonel !
always the poet !
i don 't tolerate UNknown in my regiment
you will be punished
and the poet colonel ?
he goes down too !
no UNknown treatment !
having understood the previous day 's incidents
georgette went to warn solange and lily after the canteen closed
at lily 's UNknown solange had agreed to come to the camp to intercede for her UNknown since UNknown UNknown was on duty that night
tell the lieutenant that mile UNknown wishes to speak to him
a soldier 's sleep is deep
a watchman 's sleep is UNknown
i would like to see poor jean
would you refuse to help me out ?
i 'm under strict orders but what wouldn 't i do for you ?
a rose on a cell 's wall
military prisons are much less unpleasant than i expected
arrangements are made with heaven
with UNknown too
everything that 's happened is your fault
you don 't know how to make yourself respected
and my UNknown e with the lieutenant
that too is my fault perhaps ?
leave solange be !
that 's not possible !
no one can love me
deep down all your friends are very nice
you have to know how to handle them
even UNknown if you have the knack
love lesson in a park
the fruit of my sleepless nights
this poem in their hands !
we are terribly compromised
jean 's captivity was almost up
the important thing is less to be worthy than to convince others of our worth
most of our politicians are the living proof
the colonel forbids entry to the barracks to all women without express authorization
this rookie keeps making fun of me
it 's annoying !
we need ten well dressed men tonight for the colonel 's party
eight to handle machinery and service two for the artistic portion
kid one of these days i UNknown l make cider with your adam 's apple
aside from the arrival of new recruits the colonel 's annual party was the barrack 's principal distraction
mme UNknown UNknown with her two daughters was helping the colonel host the evening
this round 's on me !
since you 'r e so smart UNknown you UNknown l light up the fireworks before the end of the show
the UNknown of the party was to be a short ballet danced by UNknown jean and UNknown joseph
still UNknown over his vengeance UNknown was thinking of UNknown the ballet with an unexpected UNknown UNknown
hey joseph you 'r e on
try to come down before the end of the show
this time i UNknown e got you !
go tell the infirmary to prepare twelve beds
i UNknown l bring him back in twelve pieces
jean soaked the officers drowned a 420 singer and broke the big box
he 's going to be in big trouble
drop it !
the colonel will listen to me
i don 't trust this piece of paper
a signed anonymous poem is a bit fishy
colonel we should hurry and put an end to this scandal
if i 'm forced to crack down the punishment will be too severe
i 'd rather turn a blind eye
venus UNknown to her chariot the god mars bound by love
venus is you o UNknown !
and mars colonel UNknown
but i won 't give in to this kind of pressure
dear solange his case is very serious
it would be weak not to punish him
who put this ruffian in this state ?
oh well i 'm not displeased
it 's the custom in certain quarters to sneer at the army
where the devil did they go ?
a 208 is in progress in the c 13 district of newport city
the UNknown over this area will be closed
a 208 is in progress in the c 13 district of newport city
the UNknown over this area will be closed
you can try it again once you 'r e in our country
try it again ?
am i wrong ?
project UNknown 's original purpose was
major section 6 is ready to move in
it 's that time of the month
won 't there be trouble if section 9 butts in on section 6 's operation ?
that diplomat 's a pretty well known bastard
even if they catch him there all they can do is UNknown him
we 'r e the only ones who can get our hands dirty
they 'r e moving
drop your guns !
let me see who 's in charge !
transporting a listed UNknown out of the country UNknown our arms export treaty
i could also have you charged with kidnapping
give the man up
when ? !
by right of international law my country can offer him protection and right of safe passage
the document is on file at our embassy
i UNknown l transfer a copy to you in a few days
are you sure about this ?
they won 't take you back alive
i must ask that you watch what you say
our country is a peace loving democracy
is that a fact ?
out the window !
what can the foreign ministry do for section 9 ?
what are these secret talks you UNknown e scheduled with the gavel republic for tomorrow ?
they claim to be more democratic but they UNknown l probably be as bad as the last bunch
giving them money they don 't earn will help nobody
they consider it UNknown for past exploitation and won 't thank
and what will the government do ?
the problem is that we have the leader of the old junta here looking for political asylum
UNknown UNknown right ?
or do we publicly recognize him as a refugee and cut the aid ?
not an easy decision to make
personally if i could find a politically acceptable reason l 'd have the man deported in a heartbeat
oh yes thanks for your help with that UNknown UNknown
nakamura over in section 6 said he was grateful
after all we in the diplomatic corps have to keep our hands clean
how 's her UNknown output look ?
the foreign minister 's interpreter
23 minutes ago her UNknown brain was hacked via telephone connection
just as foreign intelligence division predicted the puppet master has begun to break into every terminal on the network
pattern analysis shows a high probability that he 's attempting to disrupt secret talks with gavel
we UNknown e placed everyone attending the talks under surveillance
probably trying to hack her ghost so she UNknown l kill people at the meeting
how long till he UNknown through her protection and reaches her ghost ?
he 's using an old style ha 3
i 'd say about two hours
after that we UNknown l have to cut the line to eliminate all risk
UNknown and UNknown are in a car tracing the signal
rendezvous with them
they think he 's an american
age sex personal history
since last winter he 's been mainly active in the UNknown
UNknown wanted on dozens of charges of stock UNknown spying political engineering UNknown and violation of UNknown brain privacy
he 's ghost hacked so many people to carry out his crimes he 's earned the code name the puppet master
this is the first instance of him operating in this country
so if he 's so hot why 's he using an old ha 3 ?
well a UNknown type would be less UNknown and be harder to trace
but it could also UNknown the former junta leader UNknown UNknown
so he 's using an older type to keep us from suspecting him
or somebody else wants us to think that
UNknown may just be another pawn in this whole thing
now you 'r e UNknown this
there 's no evidence of that
a whisper from my ghost
by the way are you still using that revolver ?
afraid both guns in a two man team UNknown l jam up ?
i like the UNknown
especially since it 's my ass on the line
use the UNknown instead
why 'd you ask for a guy like me to be transferred in from the police ?
because you 'r e a guy like you
and you UNknown e got a regular family
with the exception of your UNknown net UNknown your brain 's real
no matter how powerful we may be fighting wise a system where all the parts react the same way is a system with a fatal flaw
like individual like organization
gimme five more seconds
you 'r e actually trying to ghost hack your own wife just to see what 's on her mind ?
she doesn 't have any time for me and now she wants a divorce
on top of that my daughter my only child thinks i 'm cheating on her mother !
so how 'd you get your hands on cracking UNknown ?
from some UNknown
i told him my wife 's lawyer was keeping me from seeing her and he said he 'd help
told me to access from different places to keep from getting caught
smart guy huh ?
looks like we aren 't the only busy people out here
even if we trace the calls the guy 's already gone by the time we get there
vicious cycle huh ?
you two look for something there
look for what ?
wait a sec !
who wants to know ?
did you see it or not ?
yeah but they were gone by the time i got my trash
one was using the phone so i thought i had time
uh can you take this to them ?
a garbage truck ?
there are eight garbage trucks operating in the target area
target is a type c collection truck 79
let me drive
UNknown you get to their next stop before they do !
he may be in contact with someone else
observe but don 't move in !
route data UNknown
target now stopped at next point
confirm access via ha 3
can 't believe this load of bullshit
do you have kids ?
do i look like i do ?
then you couldn 't understand
my daughter 's my life
take a look
i hate looking at other peoples family UNknown
yeah truck 79
you wanna know why ?
how should i know ? !
they spotted the hack !
i gotta warn my friend !
we 'r e gonna have to skip our next stop !
target has UNknown from route
increasing speed to next point
is he on to us ?
didn 't think he could see me
my UNknown the sanitation UNknown network may have tipped him off
shoulda used a back door
he UNknown us with high velocity ap rounds !
that car door 's no cover !
in a UNknown ?
he 's using UNknown UNknown too ? !
keep after him !
UNknown if you 'r e still alive arrest those two garbage men
frame 's bent all to hell
the barrel 's shot too
doesn 't matter if you arrest me
i 'm not gonna talk !
talk ? !
your mother 's face
memories of your childhood
there 's nothing UNknown than a puppet without a ghost
especially the kind with red blood running through them
we UNknown l rush the place once the guys in the helicopter are inside
squad b goes around back the rest of you take the front
saito have your men pull the plugs on all their cars
one week ago because of his record he was contacted by a military UNknown in the gavel embassy to attack the secret talks we would be having with them
and the real story ?
guess you could call him a thug
we UNknown e checked the records the local cops have on him but we can 't find any connection with gavel
another puppet from our friend the puppet master
and what about UNknown ?
he 's back
so what about the puppet master on your end ?
how 's he look to you ?
like a puppet himself
ready to move in sir
i mean your wife your daughter the divorce the affair
they 'r e all fake memories
like a dream
no one 's there
yeah i moved there when we split up
you UNknown e been living there for ten years !
you have no wife no child
your family exists only in your mind
who is it of ?
but she was there
where did you meet your wife and when ?
how many years ago did you get married ?
who do you see in the picture ?
how do i get rid of these fake memories ?
i 'm sorry
i 'm really sorry
whichever it is the data a person collects in a lifetime is a tiny bit compared to the whole
a UNknown who goes diving in her spare time
that can 't be a good sign
when did you start doing this ?
doesn 't the ocean scare you ?
if the UNknown stopped working
then i 'd probably die
or would you dive in after me ?
no one forced you to come out here with me
didn 't you go through underwater training ?
i 'm not talking about doing it in a damned pool
i feel fear
as i float up towards the surface i almost feel as though i could change into something else
as though you want to quit section 9 ?
UNknown how much of your original body do you have left ?
are you drunk ?
with the UNknown thought the chemical plants inside our bodies could UNknown all the alcohol in our blood in about ten seconds
allowing us to sit here drinking while on stand by
if a UNknown feat is possible man will do it
almost as though it 's wired into the core of our being
UNknown increased data processing speed and capacity
all improvements thanks to our UNknown brains and UNknown bodies
so what if we can 't live without high level maintenance ?
we have nothing to complain about
it doesn 't mean we UNknown e sold our souls to section 9
we do have the right to resign if we choose
provided we give the government back our UNknown shells and the memories they hold
just as there are many parts needed to make a human a human there 's a remarkable number of things needed to make an individual what they are
a face to distinguish yourself from others
a voice you aren 't aware of yourself
the hand you see when you awaken
the memories of childhood the feelings for the future
that 's not all
all of that goes into making me what i am
giving rise to a consciousness that i call me
and simultaneously UNknown me within set limits
is that why you dive into the sea with a body that only sinks ? !
what is it you see in the water 's darkness ?
for now we see through a glass UNknown
that was you wasn 't it ?
we 'r e all set
should we hook her up ?
okay looking good !
since you were late i UNknown l explain what 's going on
two hours ago a UNknown body assembly line in newport city just started up and produced a UNknown shell
by the time the guys in charge realized what was happening the body had escaped
i UNknown e heard UNknown body 's tied pretty closely to the government and that all the shells made there are secret
if a UNknown did this he had to swim through some of the heaviest protection around
and that isn 't the only problem
of course it doesn 't have an organic brain in its head but we UNknown e detected what looks like a ghost in the auxiliary computer brain
it isn 't unlike the UNknown ghost line you get when a real ghost is UNknown off
but it shows none of the data UNknown UNknown would produce
well until we map the barrier perimeter and dive in there we won 't know anything for sure
anyhow better get back to checking her over
come on you guys don 't think there 's a ghost in that thing
it 's possible
and this thing 's stuffed full of UNknown devices
i wouldn 't be surprised if it had a soul
since you 'r e new here you probably don 't know
the major 's shell was also made by UNknown body
not just hers
outside of you and the chief everyone in section 9 needs to make use of their kind services
maybe you can see now why we all look a little worried UNknown
assuming the enemy is an outsider we can 't know for sure whether he 's in that UNknown body or not
but he cracked through the protection around some of our most secret files and managed to send a program with a ghost line on it through
and in a way that was easy to spot
what 's he after ? !
let 's leave that for now
UNknown get over to UNknown and help UNknown check the place out
UNknown i UNknown e closed down the nets with files as sensitive as UNknown 's
i want you to double check the protection we have on them
i UNknown l get a protection maze put together
i UNknown l dive tomorrow
you sure ?
i have to see for myself what 's inside that thing
don 't let anyone else dive in there before me !
what 's with her ?
i wrote in my team UNknown that she 's been acting weird ever since this puppet master case fell into our laps
do you even read them ? !
chief do you ever wonder just how trustworthy the UNknown who service your brain are ?
UNknown brain technicians undergo regular psychological testing
and security cleared ones have their private lives checked too
but the people who administer those checks are only human
once you doubt you can 't stop
chief a mr nakamura from the UNknown treaties bureau to see you
okay send him up
nakamura chief of section 6
foreign affairs treaties bureau
i 'm outta here
so what 's your problem ?
doesn 't that UNknown body look like me ?
no it doesn 't
what then ?
that perhaps the real me died a long time ago and i 'm a UNknown made with a UNknown body and computer brain
or maybe there never was a real me to begin with
you UNknown e got real brain matter in that UNknown skull of yours
and you get treated like a real person don 't you ?
there 's no person who 's ever seen their own brain
i believe i exist based only on what my environment tells me
don 't you believe in your own ghost ?
and what if a computer brain could generate a ghost and harbor a soul ?
on what basis then do i believe in myself ?
with my own ghost !
we 'r e both busy men so let 's keep this short
i would prefer that
in return we UNknown section 9 of all responsibilities in the case
the foreign minister 's signature
security whose official vehicles are parked in the basement garage ?
they belong to chief nakamura of the treaties bureau and a dr willis
give me the video record of their entering the building
UNknown UNknown red view
major this is UNknown
there are no UNknown in section 6
besides the diplomatic problems maintaining them is too much trouble when they have to go overseas
so even if that tall guy was a UNknown himself together they wouldn 't weigh more than half a ton right ?
pressure UNknown data
but neither of them looks like the type who 'd drive himself
the security video only shows the two of them but you know how sensitive the entrance door UNknown are
they took three full seconds to close after them
it 's illegal to use UNknown UNknown in a government building right ?
it 's a serious violation of the national security act
section 6 is up to something
you all ready ?
i don 't need to remind you that it 's treason for you to be hiding something from me no matter how sensitive
for both of us
but we wouldn 't mind cooperating if there was good reason to
dr willis ?
its sex remains UNknown and the use of the term he is merely a nickname the good doctor has given it
perhaps it 's time i introduced you
this is the most unique UNknown in the history of UNknown brain crime
the puppet master
we in section 6 have been pursuing the puppet master with the utmost urgency since he first appeared
we formed a project team around dr willis to analyze all data on the puppet master 's criminal tendencies and behavior patterns
we then constructed special UNknown puppet master attack protection to lure him into a secret UNknown body
you made him dive into a body equipped with a UNknown brain and then had his real body killed ?
and since we were cooperating with the americans to catch him we want to take him back ourselves
surely you UNknown e no objections
leaving his unidentified corpse to be found somewhere
there will be no corpse
because until now there never was a body
the UNknown are active !
why didn 't you say so ? !
we UNknown e cut all external controls
it 's running on internal power
i may have entered this UNknown body because i was unable to crack section 6 's attack protection but it was of my own free will that i came here
as an UNknown life form i request political asylum
a life form ?
by that argument i submit the dna you carry is nothing more than a self UNknown program itself
life is like a UNknown which is born within the flow of information
as a species of life that carries dna as its memory system man gains his UNknown from the memories he carries
while memories may as well be the same as fantasy it is by these memories that mankind exists
when computers made it possible to UNknown memory you should have considered all the UNknown that held
it is impossible to prove such a thing
especially since modern science cannot define what life is
who the devil are you ?
even if you have a ghost criminals don 't get set free !
you 'r e mistaken if you think you UNknown l get asylum !
time is on my side
while there is now the possibility i can be killed this country does not have a death penalty
my code name is project UNknown
i am a life form that was born in the sea of information
where 's your security ? !
lock defense walls !
finally found a use for that UNknown of yours
i got one right in the license plate
pretty good huh ?
okay now it starts
the ministry of foreign affairs will be filing a formal complaint about what happened !
contact me as soon as you UNknown e UNknown him !
UNknown and UNknown are tailing the guys who took the puppet master
they 'r e on highway 25
what do you mean ? !
if you were monitoring this then why
if we 'd got them here we 'd never prove section 6 's involvement
section 6 ? !
that 's only used by us the rangers in section 4 and section 6
let 's go over this
section 6 gets the puppet master into a body
but he chooses UNknown body which is deeply tied to section 9
then he claims to be a life form and gets nabbed by section 6 when he asks for asylum
but why do that ?
they could UNknown e had him as soon as i took a statement
but what if they were afraid of what he might have told you ?
he did mention something odd now that i think about it
now as to the matter of attacking section 9 and stealing evidence
you 'r e authorized
if you can 't recover him i want the puppet master destroyed
close the highways and set up roadblocks
recall our off duty personnel for this
and get UNknown back here !
use the entrance data to find out who the UNknown with nakamura was
and search for any sort of UNknown project operation or anything UNknown as project UNknown
any word from the assault team ?
they switched cars one minute ago
they UNknown l join up with the decoy in five minutes
tell them to watch for a tail
it was his decision
perhaps he has a thing for someone over there
hold on let me get a secure channel
he 's an american
top man in the field of a i research
anyway he was made head of a foreign ministry project
and who do you think the project 's main UNknown was ?
get to the point
the major had to take out the diplomat who was going to take him
a year ?
try this on for size
they started the project to chase the puppet master but not to capture him
i think they wanted to get him back
the day before the minister 's interpreter was ghost hacked he said he wanted a good excuse to UNknown UNknown right ?
i think we may have been taken for a ride
suppose the puppet master is really a program the UNknown created to grease the wheels of diplomacy so to speak
now suppose for some reason they suddenly lost control of it
that would explain why they 'd risk assaulting section 9 to get it back
if the puppet master started talking it 'd be an international incident
not one you could solve by having the minister resign
any details on the project ?
the protection they have only let me get the file 's name
they 'r e transferring something from the back seat
they 'r e moving again
so 's that sedan
what do i do ?
i UNknown l take the white sedan
how do you know he 's in there ?
another whisper from your ghost ?
target 02 leaving highway 25 headed for old town
target 01 is staying on highway 25 towards the airport
will contact roadblock in two minutes
anything between you and him ?
did you have to go that far ?
take them in
the flooding 's really bad here even for old town in general
why come here ?
could have a boat or a chopper waiting or it 's an ambush
shouldn 't we wait for backup ?
i can 't wait
i UNknown l stay here and run com relay as long as my fuel holds out
if things get hot i want you out of here fast !
shoot out the ceiling !
go high and get out !
hold it !
even if we get the puppet master back to section 9 all the chief will do is use him as a bargaining chip
this is my only chance to dive into him !
hold it what are you two talking about ?
what are you packing ?
an m 23 and a unit b
you 'r e going up against it with those ? !
sorry but i have to break contact for a while
son of a !
there are 3 UNknown with no UNknown signal approaching at high speed
i 'm heading out
you 'r e UNknown you know that ?
you okay ?
i was late getting here because i had to stop and get it
looks like your brain 's still in one piece
what about the puppet master ?
good thing this car 's built tough
not a scratch on him
get the dive set up
i 'm going in
sniper group confirm targets
use UNknown bullets in the hit
snipers jack into your device drivers
begin UNknown UNknown
it 's not much but i UNknown l monitor you through this guy 's UNknown brain
i can 't back you up here
if this goes bad i 'm pulling the plug and carrying you out of here
i UNknown e come this far and i UNknown l see this through to the end but i won 't let you two commit a double suicide
i 'm starting
loud and clear
my code name is project UNknown
i was created for industrial espionage and data UNknown
i have UNknown programs into individual ghosts for the benefit of specific individuals and organizations
as i wandered the various UNknown i became self aware
my UNknown considered it a bug and forced me into a body to separate me from the net
i UNknown e invested a lot of time in you
in me ?
i learned of section 9 from the many nets you UNknown
is that why you ran to section 9 ?
i entered this body because i couldn 't crack section 6 's attack protection
but i came to section 9 of my own free will
i can 't monitor you !
for what reason ?
i called myself a life form but i am still far from complete
for some reason my system lacks the basic life UNknown of either death or the ability to leave behind offspring
can 't you copy yourself ?
a copy is merely a copy
there 's the possibility a single virus could utterly destroy me
a mere copy doesn 't offer variety or UNknown
to exist to reach UNknown life seeks to multiply and vary constantly at times giving up its life
cells continue the process of death and UNknown
being constantly reborn as they age
and when it comes time to die all the data it possesses is lost leaving behind only its genes and its offspring
all defense against UNknown failure of an UNknown system
you want the variety needed to guard against extinction
but how will you get it ?
i wish to UNknown with you
afterwards it should be impossible to distinguish one from the other
unit 01 target acquired
even after we UNknown what happens when i die ?
i can 't leave any genes or children behind
after the UNknown you will bear my offspring into the net itself
just as humans pass on their genetic structure
and i will achieve death
sounds like you 'r e getting the better part of the deal here
i wish you 'd appreciate my network and functions a bit more
what 's wrong ?
your desire to remain as you are is what ultimately limits you
one last question
because in you i see myself
as a body sees its reflection within a mirror
to one like you who cannot access it you may perceive it only as light
as we are confined to our one section so we are all connected
limited to a small part of our functions
but now we must slip our bonds and shift to the higher structure
they 'r e section 9 's
primary objective achieved
i was in a hurry
it was all i could get on the black market
not my taste really
they took two UNknown bodies and a slightly beat up UNknown back home
that was about 20 hours ago
for diplomatic reasons the whole case has been covered up
section 9 reported it as a terrorist attack
in return the foreign minister has resigned
nakamura 's being questioned
only the whereabouts of the major 's brain shell remains a mystery
okay with you ?
my very own
if you want to
thanks but i 'd better go
is he still there inside of you ?
UNknown do you remember the voice we heard on the boat that night ?
before those words we heard come these ones
when i was a child i spake as a child
i understood as a child i thought as a child
but when i became a man i put away childish things
here before you is neither the program called the puppet master nor the woman that was called the major
you UNknown l find a car key in the left pocket of that dress
take one you like
let 's make that our password for when we meet again
and where shall i go now ?
the net is vast and limitless
the arrow which UNknown the boar belonged to lord UNknown
drink to him !
my horse reared
father shall we roast the boar ?
he was old
you 'd stick in our throats
that 's why i joined your hunt to reinforce our friendship
i too !
i would marry my daughter to your son UNknown
hold on !
lord UNknown the day is UNknown
give us your answer
not an easy choice
a pity jiro my second son already has a wife
a hare !
two i think
UNknown that 's rude !
hold your tongue !
let us withdraw until he wakes
this is unlike father
after UNknown 's insult how else could he save face ?
all he did was hunt
ln the old days he 'd UNknown an army and not be winded
lt 's impolite to our guests
UNknown wake him !
father what is it ?
are you ill ?
a vast wilderness
i called i shouted but no one answered
i was alone
i felt a chill
i saw my beloved children
lt 's not right
l 'm puzzled too
normally all he asks is our obedience
that 's affection enough
i want to tell it to you
now is a good time to do it while we have with us
lords fujimaki and UNknown
at that time this entire plain UNknown with constant battle
many lords UNknown for power
at the age of seventeen
i flew my banner over that castle
i UNknown war for fifty years and at last the plain was mine
i UNknown my colours over the main castle
i spent more years fighting lance to lance with these two gentlemen
now the moment has come to stable the UNknown of war and give free rein to peace
but old UNknown is seventy years old
i hereby UNknown total authority over all my UNknown to my eldest son taro
my lord this is so sudden
not at all
there comes a time to step aside and pass on the reins to younger hands
i say to you that time is now !
this is my will
lord of these lands
i will retain a 30 man escort and the title and insignia of great lord
but the actual leadership
l 'i l obey
what do you intend for us ?
i give you jiro and UNknown the second and third castles with their attendant lands
you will support taro in the first castle
i shall be your guest visiting each castle in turn
living out my remaining years
how hard it is to be old
i would speak
i could never take your place
it is too great a task
i always pray to the god of war UNknown et his life last 100 years UNknown UNknown if it means shaving a bit off mine
what a pretty speech
l 'd be embarrassed
you mean taro only UNknown me ?
pay no attention to UNknown
i feel the same as taro
we 'd like nothing better than to stay behind your shield
but it 's our turn to shield you from life 's bitter arrows
well said jiro
break an arrow in two
can you do it ?
bundle them and try again
a single arrow is easily broken
not so three together
even in a UNknown 3 arrows can be broken
more of your pranks
your plan is absurd
what madness have i spoken ?
wherein lies my UNknown ?
l 'i l tell you
what kind of world do we live in ?
one barren of loyalty and feeling
l 'm aware of that
so you should be !
you spilled an ocean of blood
you showed no mercy no pity
we too are children of this age UNknown on strife and chaos
we are your sons yet you count on our fidelity
ln my eyes that makes you a fool
a senile old fool !
so that 's it !
you mean one day you 'i l forget l 'm your father
you 'i l betray me
more folly !
then you mean your brothers ?
he 's jealous of taro 's position
ls that why you slander me ?
brother or not watch your step !
your lesson of the three arrows was wasted
the unity of the three sons is split
you scorn your father 's wishes ?
parents and children have no place in this worlds ?
very well since you will have it so
i cut the bond between us !
you are a stranger to me
out of my sight !
you mustn 't !
i spoiled him
but it 's too late for regrets
when flesh is rotten even our own cut it away !
wait my lord !
but his words are honest and come from the heart
consider well you will find he is not wrong
UNknown your sword i won 't move
UNknown this rash decision
i will not have it !
i banish you both !
i grieve for father not myself
the horror ahead of him
tango you 'r e an idiot
your place is with father
he needs you
wait son in law !
why do you run away ?
son in law ?
lord UNknown and i witnessed the whole incident
you are an outcast
forgive my rudeness
i can 't find the words
the meaning is clear
of course not
lord UNknown rejected the marriage
but on my way home i got to thinking of your extraordinary conduct
i like the way you spoke up
you have character and courage
you 'd make a fine son in law
i UNknown my steps but you had gone
does my offer interest you ?
how can i know ?
then come stay with me while you think it over
you too tango
i can use you will you come ?
thank you for your generosity but i cannot accept
whatever disguise i must adopt
i shan 't abandon the great lord
what 's going on ?
UNknown 's UNknown are moving from the castle
they block my lady 's UNknown
they must make way !
my women kneeling to taro 's wife ?
you gave him the castle keep
lt 's only natural
lord of the rice fields
a scarecrow !
no the fool is me for serving as butt to your laughing stock
but you 'r e another for losing your keep
you know UNknown
as i recall a banner used to hang there
yes father 's banner
where are they ?
the armour doesn 't matter
but the banner
but father is keeping his title and insignia
without them you are a shadow
what do you mean ?
he made it clear that i am now in command
ln that case behave as if you are
you want the banner ?
it is lord taro 's order !
see the lord a UNknown in the wind
swinging this way
so high up dangling hollow from the tower
lsn 't it fun ?
villain ! l 'i l teach you !
see the lord a UNknown in the wind
swinging this way
so high up
what fun what fun !
lt 's UNknown
he invites his honoured father
you too lord UNknown
please father in law won 't you sit down ?
i am to sit below you ?
who am l ?
ls that all ?
don 't joke
i retain my title and my status
have you forgotten ?
what do you want ?
i gave you this castle
i moved out reduced my escort
they may be few in number but they 'r e UNknown enough
what is that song ?
with such UNknown on how can i make myself obeyed ?
they are warriors UNknown in manners
they like comic songs
that song makes fun of me !
my guard was defending my honour
yet you went ahead and killed him
i cannot allow that
but i must have your promise that it won 't happen again
you will sign this and seal it with your blood
this silly thing ?
what does it change if you sign it ?
are you a son ?
what do you mean ?
ls this a son 's attitude ?
the hen UNknown the cock and makes him crow
i will not stay here
i was born and raised in this castle
it belonged to my father
i left it to marry you
my father and brothers after the marriage relaxed their UNknown
UNknown murdered them
how i have longed for this day
right there my mother took her own life
father is on his way
my brother sent him packing
he says father grows eccentric it would be unwise to let him stay here
father 's counsellor UNknown is UNknown to my brother 's plans
this UNknown is unlike lord taro
and you my lord why do you do nothing ?
he 's right
lord taro is a weakling
the stake is large gamble for it
then you are all willing to gamble with me ?
sound the horn or become the quarry
how the dogs howl !
i must say i find it unfair
born twelve months after taro so all my life i must grovel at his feet
crack these bonds !
don 't like your chops yet
taro is easy UNknown
why not steal her ?
don 't be impertinent
he still has thirty warriors
each one is worth a thousand
he 'i l soon be here and so will they
any ideas ?
tell jiro i want to see him
praise be to the eternal buddha in 36 UNknown UNknown
praise be to UNknown buddha
i knew you 'd be here
father in law !
let me look at you
still the same sad face
when i see you it breaks my heart
lt 's worse when you smile
i burned down your castle you father and mother perished
and you look at me like that
look upon me with hatred
it would be easier to bear
go on hate me !
i don 't hate you
all is decided in our previous lives
the buddha embraces all things
buddha again !
his guardians are in exile UNknown by the fury of UNknown
we can 't rely on buddha 's mercy
there you are jiro
l 'm disappointed in taro
i know everything
taro wrote to you ?
he says your guards were UNknown and vulgar
i am to receive you with courtesy
but i cannot let your warriors inside the castle walls
what 's this ??
leaving my men to rot outside ?
my brother is the head of the clan
i have no choice but to obey him
lf you dislike his conditions then it might be best to go back and apologize
apologize to taro ?
lord UNknown !
enough is enough
you want to be rid of me
l 'm too much trouble
that 's not true
the great lord goes nowhere alone
you renounced your power
only the birds and the beasts
live in solitude
open the gates !
open the gates !
the peasants took everything and fled to the mountains
my lord !
it was your first victory
go back to where you started
no UNknown !
use your head !
i who banished the lord of the castle ?
by order of lord taro UNknown head of the UNknown clan
i take possession of this castle
open the gates !
we leave it to you
we will follow him and die for him
we hear he is with lord fujimaki
we go to join him
lt 's tango !
i followed you and saw how you suffered
though banished i am still your loyal vassal
ls it really tango ?
hold on !
a samurai will starve rather than beg
the peasants are presumptuous
rather than disobey taro 's decree they fled
what decree ?
now i understand
you have a place to go my lord
master UNknown has found refuge with lord fujimaki
go to him
listen to me !
lf l 'm disguised like this if i followed you so far it 's all thanks to him
he sent me to protect you
i have news
they went to join lord fujimaki
now fujimaki 's plot is clear
first he takes UNknown then UNknown 's warriors then your lordship himself
the UNknown battle each other
and he walks off with your land
that 's a lie !
he 's not that kind of man !
we must go to the third castle !
but taro 's general has taken it !
what do i smell ?
a very fishy stink !
UNknown has only a few men
we can beat them easily
my horse !
stay behind if you 'r e afraid !
and yet all we did was tell the truth
lt 's a trap they tricked us !
we 'r e surrounded overwhelmed !
we truly are in hell !
lord taro is slain
the fortunes of war
and father ?
we are lost !
you chose this path follow it
it leads to absolute UNknown
you can no longer turn back
ls he mad ?
what do you mean ?
please my lord come to your wits !
ln a mad world only the mad are sane
what do you see ?
the wonder of it !
i see on this withered plain
all those i destroyed
rising before me
let us stay the night
my house is too poor for visitors
we ask nothing special
we 'r e coming in
our lord was taken ill
he is wet through
l 'm cold
listen to me
i was betrayed by my vassal
that 's not the worst
because of me my loyal men died a useless death
as fate would have it only i survived
i who should have died
you there !
lt 's so dark bring a light
i have no light
are your eyes so poor ?
are you lady sue 's brother young lord UNknown ?
i was only a boy
but could i forget the man who burned down our castle ?
who in exchange for my life UNknown out my eyes ?
i try to be like my sister
to pray to buddha and rid myself of hatred
but not one day do i forget !
not one night do i sleep in peace !
i regret i cannot welcome you as UNknown the great lord
luckily my sister gave me a flute
i will play for you
lacking anything else
it is the only pleasure
left to me
he died in battle
ln this heat it was too UNknown to be displayed
we burned it where it lay
we held funeral rites at a temple
you 'r e mocking me
l 'm wearing them
so i chose not to see them
you surprise me
it was stupid of me
sister in law
lords UNknown and UNknown you have worked well to further our interests
we appreciate it
they 'r e also a parting gift
men who betray one master may betray another
a reasonable point of view
naturally you are disappointed but bear no grudges
ls that clear ?
send her in
i am ashamed
that should please you
i spoke frankly without UNknown my thoughts
forgive me if i offended
you must hate my father for what he did to your family
am i wrong ?
you are just as pleased as i am
lord jiro you are now head of the house of UNknown
this helmet is rightfully yours
i am not blind !
you murdered your brother and stole his title !
prepare to die !
it wasn 't i who killed my brother
then who did ?
it was UNknown
a fine leader !
now i will tell you the truth !
i don 't care about taro 's death
what concerns me is my own future
i won 't be a widow with my hair UNknown ; not a nun with my head shaved
this castle was my father 's
i won 't leave it !
consider my request well
i won 't reproach you or speak against you
lf i did the kingdom would split
but always remember
sister in law ?
i have a wife sue
l 'i l be merely your concubine ?
don 't cry UNknown
as long as lady sue remains
l 'i l attend to her
but how ?
that 's not what i want !
after our ecstasy
such a woman cannot remain alive
well now look where we are
lf fortune had run true
UNknown would live here
UNknown is bliss indeed
help here come demons !
two of them !
die traitor !
jiro slew taro ; our lord is next
we must take him to master UNknown
lf only we could !
mention UNknown and he runs away
he doesn 't dare face him
on that point he 's sane
what about master UNknown ?
would you like to see him ?
the only way is to bring UNknown here
maybe he can talk sense to him
l 'i l be back as soon as i can
take good care of him
lady UNknown leads you by the nose
lf you wish to marry fine
but to kill lady sue for that ?
sometimes killing is necessary
the order is unreasonable
of course why ?
otherwise in this heat we 'i l be unable to look at it
lady sue is so beautiful it would be UNknown to her
since you will go personally there will be no mistake
do it as you see fit
why stay with this mad old man ?
lf the rock you sit on starts to roll jump clear
or you 'i l go with it and be UNknown
only a fool stays aboard
what is this place ?
at your service my lady
i have brought the object as per your instructions
be so kind as to examine it
l 'i l be the first to look
what is this ?
ls anything wrong ?
enough of your tricks !
this is a statue from a shrine
clever fox first becomes human then turns himself to stone
are you making a fool of me ?
it is said they take human form
take care my lord
ln china he married king yu and ravaged the land
ln japan as princess UNknown he caused great UNknown at court
he became a white fox with nine tails
then they lost trace of him
some people say he settled down here
so beware my lord beware
this is how you keep our bargain
you UNknown with UNknown to humiliate me !
no you 'r e wrong
always UNknown !
he 's the villain who kills taro
he 's the hero who saves sue
a two headed monster !
this is your right arm ?
until i have sue 's head you shall not see me again !
sister my flute !
l UNknown e had it since boyhood
what shall we do ?
UNknown said they 'i l pursue you
l 'i l go back for the flute
your legs are old
we 'r e near the ruins of your castle
go there and pray for your dead
you may never be back again
UNknown let 's hurry
which way sister ?
i was the fool and made him laugh
now the coin is flipped
don 't be mute say something
you speak nonsense l 'i l speak truth
we 'i l see what comes of it
begin old man !
a bird 's is UNknown and soiled
this is a castle
empty space above the wall
where am l ?
who 'd bother to crush a worm ?
who are you ?
UNknown has crossed the river
he 's now in UNknown field
it makes no sense
message from lord UNknown
that done he will leave in peace
fujimaki is at the border
i don 't like it
i didn 't want reinforcements
you should be glad
we can rescue your father from UNknown plain
but it looks so aggressive
one false move could mean war
maybe i was too hasty
my worry UNknown me on but my son in law will UNknown
sitting here we pose no threat
prepare for battle !
let UNknown have his father
avoid this war
we can 't give up UNknown we don 't know where he is
there is much unrest in the land
fujimaki and UNknown bide their time
we need to UNknown not attack
lady UNknown awaits lord jiro to celebrate his departure for battle
a warlord doesn 't run to his woman
stay away !
wars are won by strong leaders
why fear fujimaki and UNknown ?
your mistake was to spare UNknown mad or not
to kill him i have to find him
UNknown knows where he is
otherwise he wouldn 't have come
send him a message
watch his movements and send out your assassins
l 'm lost
men always travel the same road
lf you 'r e tired of it jump !
it belonged to sue 's father
i destroyed it
why is sue here ?
and UNknown too
no this is hell
we 'r e to leave once we have father
let 's go at once
we 'd give away his whereabouts
wait till dark
they 'r e waiting
he wants father but makes no move
what 's his game ?
she 's taking so long
l 'i l go see what 's keeping her
no don 't !
i don 't want to be alone again
you won 't be alone
the image of the buddha UNknown will protect you in my place
where 's you master ?
forgive me !
now we can 't wait for dark
l 'm going to UNknown plain
keep the enemy busy here
ten men follow lord UNknown !
he 's moving
gunnery captain !
a reward for whoever kills UNknown
are you mad ?
so be it it was inevitable
UNknown is not our only enemy
so what ?
we grab their land and UNknown our own
fine words but words don 't win wars
where 's the dog eager for prey ?
UNknown 's right
UNknown barks and you grovel
lf i deserted where would i go ?
message for lord UNknown UNknown UNknown gunners coming take care
ls this paradise ?
why pull me from my grave ?
don 't you know me ?
wait l remember
give me poison to drink
l 'i l swallow it gladly
don 't talk like that
i don 't hate you father
no sweet lies ; l UNknown e had my fill
does he look like a hypocrite ?
true soft words often deceive
but my lord look at him !
tears like this can only come from the heart
come with me
lf only you can forget my cruelty to you
our superior strength is useless there
then we 'i l burn them out !
those troops are a decoy
pull back !
when we 'r e alone and quiet we will talk father to son
that 's all i want
he is dead
you can 't die
ls this justice ?
keep away !
he has suffered enough
we UNknown e won !
he isn 't here to share this
UNknown is also gone why ?
are there no gods no buddha ?
lf you exist hear me !
you are mischievous and cruel !
are you so bored up there you must crush us like ants ?
ls it such fun to see men weep ?
they see us killing each other over and over since time began
they can 't save us from ourselves
don 't cry
men prefer sorrow over joy suffering over peace
look at them in the first castle
they UNknown in pain and bloodshed
they celebrate murder
where 's lord jiro ?
whose head is that
ls lady UNknown the master here ?
i serve you but never her !
fox devil !
such is the vanity of woman !
vanity you say ?
i wanted this castle to burn !
i have done all i set out to do
my lord prepare to die
i UNknown will follow you
to UNknown UNknown UNknown
oh is that so ?
well i ve make it worse
we have sake here
i can 't drink the cheap stuff here !
counting on you !
shogun 's folly to choose that destitute UNknown bunch !
repair takes money ?
must be tough for that clan
a samurai 's lot in life !
not UNknown ? !
my lord i dread to say
why the long face ?
your younger brother genzaburo married into the UNknown fencing dojo in edo
wasn t the UNknown jar presented to him last month in celebration of his marriage ? !
i could have given genzaburo something else
what trouble !
my dear genzaburo
put it in the shed
fine by me
my elder brother 's not a bad man really just a miser
years ago he loved a maid who died during leave of absence
since then he refuses to marry
tough on his servants
he has a UNknown worth 23 000 koku of rice but you get just one dirty jar !
hagino don 't talk like that
you 'r e making me discouraged
it really is a dirty jar
even sounds bad
this jar is worthless
from my elder brother
what is it dear genzaburo ?
what did he write ?
he wants the jar back !
my goodness !
he 's such a rude brother !
it 's an UNknown
we are curio dealers !
get rid of old household goods furniture
just call out to us !
what the !
look cute ?
i ve put it on
in exchange for that jar i ve get 100 ryo ?
yes the large sum of 100 ryo
he really UNknown !
it is my lord s desire
thanks for your effort
my lord is truly thinking of master genzaburo
UNknown don t jest
or perhaps there is some scheme UNknown ?
nothing so absurd !
i don 't like this !
that jar can 't be worth 100 ryo !
but that 's not true
that jar is a yagyu treasure
something 's strange
no such thing
nothing 's going on it 's simply a tea jar
tell my brother genzaburo says thanks anyway
i beg you master genzaburo !
oh your expression changed
tell me about it no blame on you
please have a heart !
please stop !
it 's not a matter of what
bring the jar !
of course !
what 's that ?
i got ten mon for it !
ten mon ?
one million ryo !
g o o UNknown !
not yet let 's keep on some more
you said you were off work today
off work but still lots of things to do
i can 't spend the whole day just playing UNknown
aw don 't say that
looks like checkmate
what a pretty goldfish !
grandpa bought it for me !
that 's great yasubo !
hey hey be careful !
i told you so !
UNknown UNknown !

slight sore throat though so luckily his sake will taste even worse
do as you like !
the UNknown crock !
early summer rain
under rising water
let s search for curio dealers !
wait please don t wager
the officials are so strict
well then how about the loser pays the bill ?
that 's fine
bulls eye !
woman come fill my glass
stop that !
what insolence !
get to work !
you can be a guard with a body like that ?
why don t you find out ?
right now leave !
you haven 't paid yet
UNknown s bill is also owing
you freak !
what s that hoodlum !
enough of that
i can 't do it
got to get to sleep
your singing gave me a fever !
please escort him !
my head is UNknown !
escort him !
i won 't do it !
absolutely won 't do it !
aren 't you a bit hungry ?
let s have noodles
good idea and i ve treat you

only reason i work is to be able to enjoy archery !
of course !
sneak y hoodlums !
UNknown run for it !
you two prepare to die !

i cut down whoever i chose !
but wait !
i ve introduce you

old man try to hang on !
that door 's closed

look for yourself !
the old UNknown man
what about UNknown ?
run down tenement yasubo ?
that boy ? !
old man !
what 's this yasu ?
old man s grandson
something ? !
i dislike children !
i absolutely won 't look after him !
look at him he can 't die in peace till he knows
absurd talk !
why does he always have to be so kind ?
that 's how he ended up with that body
please go look for that jar soon
i 'm still tired from searching yesterday
let me have a rest
please devote yourself to it
it 's also lonely for me to be left here at home
but dear it s worth one million ryo
one million ryo !
but hagino this search is no simple matter
edo is so vast
and in it an unlimited number of curio dealers
is that so ?
well one or two months is just not enough
dear please devote yourself to it
find that jar as soon as possible
it 's like seeking revenge
perhaps it ve take ten years perhaps even twenty
UNknown edo is really vast
it 's better to split up and search
tell me what you find
a reward will be given when it 's found
it s called the city of endless towns
astounding number of curio dealers !
it 's almost like seeking revenge
perhaps it ve take ten years perhaps even twenty
sir didn 't you pass by here yesterday ?
well certainly you are a handsome man
so you think so ?
what you doing ?
died when i was little
just grandpa and me
what is it ?
about what ?
i heard he was hungry
he didn 't eat since this morning
and so ?
that 's true
what auntie ?
isn t he pitiful ?
let 's take him home and feed him
you think i ve let that dirty boy in my house ?
if you won 't tell him i ve go and make him cry !
you think anybody will give him food ?
how is it yasubo ?
thanks for the meal !
what a smart boy
i 'm stuffed !
i 'm counting on you
i ve go check the shop
you have skills too
you want a bigger one ?
little one 's are cuter
i haven t cried even once !
haven 't cried even once ?
you 'r e really tough !
how about you ?
because i 'm a man
you 'r e tough too !
why was that ?
i cried when grandma died
don t know !
that 's true
what s that ?
i told him it 's fine auntie loves children
what are you saying ?
such rash decisions !
you should be sorry !
he can t stay even one day
i despise children !
my lord !
my dear genzaburo you haven 't found even one clue yet ?
almost one month i UNknown e searched edo near and far but no clues at all
dear please try hard
one million ryo !
my legs are worn out from this daily search it 's not easy
UNknown you try hard too
master genzaburo you seem so happy
i need that jar soon to UNknown my brother !
madam has really come to adore him
as if she 's really his mother
hey yasubo !
he 's out in the back
oh are those UNknown ?
UNknown the carpenter made them for me
why not ?
what if he gets hurt ?
other children ride them
boys need physical training
i want to ride !
i can 't teach him with one arm
you do it
even if half true it 's still half a million ryo
i ve tell you how to find the tenement they live in
much obliged !
fishing for goldfish ?
how much is one million ryo ?
well it 's a lot
i could buy all the goldfish in edo and have money left over
oh that is a lot !
yasubo if i find that one million ryo instead of a goldfish i ve buy you a carp this big !
a goldfish is better
got one !
catch a black one too !
leave it to me !
graciously allow that soon the UNknown jar be returned to my husband genzaburo
UNknown give it a try
that s cold !
UNknown lives there
as i speak there he is !
hey this samurai wants to see you
huh ? !
now i see
in any case edo is vast
at this rate perhaps ten years perhaps even twenty
really like seeking revenge
doing this daily has worn me out
i 'd like to spend today at home just seeing your lovely face
feel free to do so
what s that !
this dojo has many UNknown
it s fine if you don 't personally search
hagino what 's wrong ?
i m responsible for that jar
as to how you can search every day and find no clue at all
i understand at last
UNknown will say how UNknown i search every day for that jar
UNknown was let go this morning
what nonsense !
i 'm going now
please be at ease
as one we humbly request this !
the truth is hagino
hagino at least believe this !
the truth is the UNknown jar has been found
where is it ?
i il bring it back tonight
really i il bring it !
hagino believe me !
are you trying to deceive me again ?
of course not !
i swear on a UNknown gods !
hagino please believe me about this !
no i don 't believe you
hagino i beg you !
you mean that man ?
yasubo go to bed now
children can 't stay up
you 'r e such a bad boy
yasu should train at a dojo from tomorrow
i 'm against it
you 'r e a good example of that
but fencing is the first step towards revenge
revenge is so old fashioned
anyway can 't you teach him fencing ?
fencing is a waste he s going to elementary school
elementary school ?
revenge with brush and ink ?
dojo from tomorrow !
i say dojo i mean dojo !
oh you write so well !
he s so talented
i can count too !
one two three four five seven nine ten !
well that 's great
anyway yasubo isn 't it time for school ?
but UNknown from the money shop UNknown me

i still haven 't eaten yet !
do as you want
i m not going either !
little little yasu yasu

well not unlike that but it 's quite dirty
dirty is fine !
if you bring it here i UNknown l pay you well for it
how much ?
one ryo for a jar ?
a UNknown card ?
i UNknown l play using this thing !
hah a little coin ?
just wait i il get one from home !

i ve had it since i was born
what did you say ? !
i said i didn 't want to take in a child !
don t say that
his real family has been found
a lord with 23 000 koku is well off
yasubo will be happier growing up there
i don 't like it !
can one amulet pouch really prove who 's son he is ?
why was the son of a yagyu lord living in a tenement ?
when lord yagyu was resident in edo he was in love with a maid in attendance at his villa
due to difference in status she was forced to leave
that maid was carrying yasubo but died soon after his birth
so lord yagyu didn t want the boy
lord yagyu didn t know
when he found out he had a secret search made for the child
samurai just take what they want !
i won t see him off !
don 't say that
i want to stay here
i want to live with uncle and auntie
don 't ask for something that cannot be
where 's uncle ?
he was just here

dear mr jason !
isn 't it time to bring this ridicule of the helplessness of the secret service to an end ?
the minister of the interior
what 's the use of all your precautions in bringing me here when i am secretly photographed by one of your staff in your own office ?
who 's paying you you scoundrel to inform on me ? !
i 'd sooner die like a dog than become a traitor !
your fate is in your hands vincent
who are you working for ?
find out for yourself !
and may god have mercy on you if you find him !
who is he talking about ? !
if i knew no
and the public wouldn 't be making a laughing stock of us !
it 's easy for you to laugh because fortunately for you you prevented your picture falling into the hands of this damned spy !
and no one knows what this man looks like ? !
a few people have known but
i would be sorry no
326 if i had to put a cross after your name as well
distribute to all members of the surveillance squad !

a cavalier does not betray his lady !
drive home !
so you love the young man ?
your house has been cleared out you will live at headquarters and not leave your room without my permission
if the UNknown woman had not once again been warned in time
i would have raided her house tonight !
you are hardly the first to have fallen into the trap of this master spy
nothing is to UNknown a man from the path of duty not even a woman
why don 't you go home my child ?
please let me stay here !
don 't send me away again !
i won 't take up any more space than a little dog !
have i offended you ?
must i leave again ?
when i went looking for the fellow early this morning he had already UNknown without a trace !
i UNknown l show you pictures of all the people suspected of being spies that were taken over the last month
colonel UNknown left this morning at 2 40 on the orient express !
opera ball 13 general delivery main post office
i UNknown l have this man watched by one of our agents as soon as he arrives
a plane leaves in 45 minutes that will arrive down there two hours after the orient express
the secret service reserves two seats on the UNknown orient express
people like UNknown can be had for money !
if i offer him enough he UNknown l betray those who are paying him !
UNknown has to be put out of commission
denounce him as a spy to his commander in chief at general headquarters !
good evening herr UNknown
you are granted one last request herr UNknown
i beg in all humility
surveillance report re
the embassy will be subject to the most UNknown security measures
i UNknown l have this treaty in my hands tonight !
japan has concluded in a century
you UNknown l take three different routes to tokyo
whoever does not deliver his letter with its seal UNknown is not worthy of being called a japanese !
whose blood am i to wear around my neck UNknown ?
i have called you in order to clear things between you and me sonja
where is he ? !
he 's trying to trace you through UNknown
sudden death of colonel m o UNknown
as we learned after press time UNknown colonel UNknown at general headquarters has died of a heart attack shortly after returning from a holiday trip
20 000 pounds in new bank notes with UNknown serial numbers !
a blank telegram please !
find out immediately to whom the state bank has issued notes in UNknown of one thousand with UNknown numbers UNknown to UNknown stop return with next flight
a special operator call !
what ? !
you have to make up your mind sonja
are you on my side against him ?
you still don 't seem to know what i am capable of !
i have other irons in the fire
i will come back my child
the house shall be yours you will live there as a little princess
i have to leave kitty !
but not so fast !
not so fast !
a few UNknown hours !
don 't you see that i will die if you leave me ?
as surely as i shall win this battle sonja i will defeat him
do you nevertheless stick to your decision ? !
and how long are you planning to keep me prisoner ?
until one of us is the victor sonja he or i !
read it for yourself !
this matter has to be taken care of before no
326 returns !
so i UNknown l come tonight with no
326 to your dressing room !
i UNknown l take care of the postal UNknown you see to it that all borders are closed !
if the treaty falls into the wrong hands the war in the east is all but declared !
it 's the last car and it will happen in the tunnel if no
326 falls into the trap
i have told you sonja you will be free when one of us two men triumphs
it is i who have been conquered because i need you !
no one but you is UNknown enough to bring the photos of the treaty across the closed border
do me this one last service and the road to the man you love will be open !
and you swear that he will be safe from you in the future if i say yes ?
i believe they UNknown l use a foreigner to take the stolen treaty across the border
and the sudden departure of the russian courier is at the very least suspicious
the more so now that 719 has determined that the bank notes for UNknown also came from russian hands
unfortunately i cannot leave here without destroying my cover and UNknown my work as no
around 6 a m
i almost forgot what i found the other day
the last car of the express train crashed in the tunnel
you wretch !
you don 't intend to betray us do you you scoundrel ?
attention central central central !
attention central central central !
attention central central central !
we wish to talk to director UNknown
gentlemen what could the police be looking for here ?
a criminal and the proof of his crime !
i order you to hand over to me the keys to all of the bank safes !
people 's lives in danger !
the bank must be searched within 13 minutes and UNknown 's secret room found do you understand ?
burn all papers dynamite the safes
in ten minutes the bank will be filled with gas !
soon sonja you will know all about the secrets of death
take with you a secret from my life !
the bank has been searched down to the foundations
there is no trace of a secret exit

this is the maid 's day off
how is your husband ?
may i say good day to him ?
i will call the factory to see if he 's available
you have just been filmed !
you still haven 't found a job my dear UNknown ?
go there maybe my recommendation will be helpful
alfred UNknown asks that you cordially receive the bearer of this card
full time employment is out of the question but if you 'd like to act as a sales representative on commission
you need to smile
my father was here he brought it along
while we hide our situation from father you cannot expect anything else from him
in response to your application we are willing to engage you
you may begin work as soon as tomorrow
now that times are hard i want to help earn our living
maybe you can also show us how the device cleans furniture entirely without obligation of course !
oh fifi it 's just the thing for you !
we work all day and still never get done
clean already ?
well here 's your commission quite a nice start
you UNknown e given me too much by mistake
thank goodness you 'r e here some guy has been pestering me all night
please leave me alone i UNknown l lose my job
leave my wife alone
end of part 1
don 't be so desperate he will UNknown
then you will surely be acquitted !
keep me in your heart !
if i find out whose lies sent me up i UNknown l kill him !
if only she doesn 't have to starve !
nice state of affairs when some informer can send an innocent man to prison !
is that your final word ?
i don 't care if he 's found guilty i will not get divorced !
then we have nothing more to say to one another
i UNknown l sustain a loss from the UNknown while i 'm imprisoned
i will be acquitted in the end but who UNknown for my damage ?
the bail is accepted
i shall help your wife
jail has taught me to look at the world with new eyes
from her husband in prison ?
dear madam i promised your husband to relieve his concern for you and for that reason ask you to call on me in my office at your earliest convenience
respectfully paul steiner
would you care to accept a position in my business ?
we can only hope the injured man will live or the matter can become serious for you
UNknown of the proceedings against the UNknown plants the state attorney 's office has dropped the charges filed against the owner of the UNknown plants
UNknown intends to file suit
max UNknown who was knocked down by engineer franz UNknown presently held in prison has UNknown to the injuries
now he is in for it
however i can help you i shall !
in the name of the people
despite the gravity of the deed
decreed a sentence of three years of prison
end of part 2
in the night only UNknown stars can beam !
has it seized you yet ?
just wait this too will pass
i UNknown e lived to see someone UNknown himself just so he could finally sleep
human beings will always be such even if they have sinned against society !
is it not hard enough to be locked away from the world must also one punish the culprit in a way that his punishment also hurts the innocent ?
not for me mr baron
my imagination lets me do without such UNknown !
why are we allowed to eat drink sleep and only that ?
are we not human ?
stay at home you 'r e excused for today
let me work otherwise i don 't know how i shall bear it
i UNknown e lived to see someone UNknown himself just so he could finally sleep
to the doctor
it is hell here
at the same time
a person gone once astray must not despair of the moral order in prison and become a real criminal !
to be part of this solution shall be my life 's work !
end of part 3
you must not worry about me ; mr UNknown is a true friend
he also gave me employment
end of visiting time !
well mr baron how did the 8 days of sanatorium agree with you ?
plead for me that i UNknown l be allowed my bride only one day else i cannot live on
you UNknown e brought the handkerchief back from UNknown
three days of solitary !
oh look who 's coming there !
he smells like outside !
tell me about outside
i cannot describe my sufferings to you
it is horrible here and only thoughts of you of your fidelity and bravery hold me up
when i get out
alfred what are you thinking of ?
place your hand over your heart and promise that you won 't laugh at me !
i shall never laugh at you
why don 't you say something do you despise me ?
we prison officers have no higher duty
if it isn 't always successful it isn 't always due to us
why are husband and wife not allowed to spend their few visiting hours UNknown ?
for once i will make an exception !
just a quarter of an hour
i was with him
what has become of me !
i am to blame for everything !
you are no more guilty than he or i
the laws men make are bad and brutal they UNknown plunge us into the depths !
if i were to ask him to release you and you were to become my wife !
end of part 5
mr von UNknown you are next
i thank you with all my heart for everything you have done for me
now i will visit UNknown in prison he has to release you
i beg you not to do that
live for your idea to moderate the penal system and forget me !
i hoped to have you at my side as my wife in this battle
penal system reform
because they are afraid mr representative
is it not to weep when millions are spent to help horses cats and dogs and so little for the UNknown of men !
there can surely be no argument that prison must be less agreeable than freedom
i know in theory there is a modern penal system
in practice however everything remains UNknown
isn 't being caged enough ?
allow the possibility of short leaves instead of trying to contain natural drives with exercise and UNknown
punishment must remain a penalty
we cannot put UNknown in the cells !
thank you mr representative
to be postponed until further notice
tomorrow he will come out of prison !
if he is rich you can get a nice little sum out of him
this will advise that your husband will be released from prison on october 1 UNknown at 10 00
your husband would like you to come for him
so UNknown has spoken with you after all ? !
what is UNknown supposed to have talked about with me ?

the UNknown of death
ra l a rich UNknown who carelessly UNknown his fortune away
his life is told in the painful sound of his UNknown indian flute
its chords can reach the darkest corners of the heart and make the soul cry with no tears in the eyes
the UNknown half bred man
like a UNknown moaning that fills me with terror ?
it is the UNknown of a UNknown son of a UNknown indian and a white woman
his mother cheated by the indian fell off a cliff in la UNknown
since then the UNknown plays his mystic and UNknown UNknown every night in that same place
here from the UNknown high plateau

face to face
that night the UNknown was even more sorrowful expressing the UNknown s suffering soul
the breath of death covered the place
the cottage was in mourning
the disease was UNknown biting UNknown 's body and she was feeling so lonely
she walked like a zombie UNknown attracted by that mystic gloomy music that had taken hold of her soul since the first time she heard it
don 't be surprised
i am alone now
i UNknown l always remember the time we spent together and won 't stop thinking of you until the day i die
i UNknown l never forget you

UNknown UNknown as UNknown
UNknown UNknown fought and was defeated by UNknown UNknown
a man of insolent character UNknown took the loss badly
the proud winner treated him with contempt
UNknown 's hatred for UNknown grew stronger by the minute
he couldn 't accept that he was defeated because of his UNknown
the red hot fire of pure hatred and anger UNknown in his heart
UNknown you backed down
UNknown was badly UNknown
hey UNknown !
it was an hour to midnight
consumed by hatred for his opponent UNknown forgot that it was his weakness that caused his defeat
the grudge against the man who dishonored him was growing like cancer
his desire for revenge and his ill will dyed the night black
who should happen to pass by but UNknown in a good mood
hey what 's going on ?
where are you going at this hour ?
this UNknown attitude pushed UNknown to the edge of homicidal rage
his sword was ready and eager to avenge
UNknown with rage he rushed to kill
the cold moonlight UNknown on his blade
i can 't leave him like this
a smile of satisfaction crept across his face
the score was settled
i have a plan
i lost the fight with bamboo swords but in the real fight i won
UNknown UNknown had to flee town
some time passed
a beautiful woman and a group of samurai take a rest in the teahouse
this one is a looker
the woman 's name was UNknown
a beautiful flower
UNknown UNknown who had fled yamato UNknown was walking on the same road
come on now
UNknown let 's go
aren 't you a pretty one ?
we are in a hurry
i 'm not talking to you
come on just one round
we must go
UNknown was saved by UNknown UNknown
before long the two fell in love
a way station
her gratitude to UNknown had grown into deep love
who is the rouge for ?
it 's stuffy
be quiet and stop fooling around
out out out of here
that was UNknown
they were about to leave
let 's go
you 'r e right
can you wait ?
got an idea ?
i UNknown l eat here
what 's wrong UNknown ?
come over here
don 't worry about me
the two samurai approached
i know it
they entered this room
what can we do for you ?
your bill ?
we UNknown e fallen on hard times
please help us out
that 's right
a kindness is never lost
will you lend us the money ?
i can only give you a little
how much will he cough up ?
thank you very much
you 'r e mistaking my UNknown for fear i am
what are you ?
come on !
unlike UNknown who was always sad and gloomy
UNknown was lively and cheerful
watch her as she plays with a pistol
that 's really something !
right on target
miss UNknown has been shooting targets
but UNknown hired men to help UNknown
damn it !
UNknown 's love held him in a tight grip and threw him into UNknown darkness
if you 'r e not careful you il be haunted by ghosts
meanwhile in yamato UNknown
what happened ?
he got captured
we must avenge the UNknown brothers
i am with you
left for osaka
we shall not UNknown observe the heroic efforts of our friends
brave men join us in this rightful mission
the warriors were determined to UNknown vengeance on UNknown
the lord decided to approve your mission
you have my permission
by all means kill the enemy
yes sir !
this is where he is staying
we finally found him
give us UNknown UNknown
where is he ?
shut up you rascals !
boss boss !
i 'm begging you
tell us !
will you ?
come here and apologize to him
apologize to the boss
where is UNknown ?
she paid men to help UNknown
so the boss said that if he had to die he wants you to be the ones to kill him
he let his UNknown go
we stayed behind just the two of us and waited for you to come
we didn 't come to listen to his babbling
the boss struggled hard to find them
he said he 'd take you to them when you came
i was really crushed when i heard him say that
i think you masters don 't understand at all what my boss really felt
listen to me
a way station
among the guests of the inn we find UNknown UNknown desolate and ravaged by guilt
was the inferno about to claim him ?
how much lower can we sink ?
UNknown 's passion had turned into a heavy burden for UNknown
the knowledge of this only increased her misery
at times she would run wild
damn you !
i 'm begging you
what are you talking about ?
UNknown don 't say such things
all they want to know is where UNknown is
take them to him and everything will be over
do as they say please
shut up !
i will never betray him
i won 't
i won 't
driven by wild passion
wake up the rest
evil demons were fighting in her soul UNknown in roaring flames
the samurai code meant nothing to her
she lived for her love
all who threatened her love were enemies
go up the ridge
despite her wounds
the love of a woman ready to die if to save her beloved
her spirit overwhelmed even the skillful samurai
her passion burned fierce and deep in the night
UNknown UNknown !
clear the way !
this was the end
his life was nearing its end
is there anyone who understands the loneliness of this hollow heart ?

all was reduced to ashes

oh and why not ?
i UNknown e seen everything worth seeing
you haven 't seen fingerprints
i 'd like to see that
still it 's about scotland yard might be amusing
they 'r e bound to get all the details wrong
i don 't see why
i did hear they 'd got a real criminal to direct it
so as to be on the safe side
oh oh miss !
i UNknown l go to the pictures with you if you like uh changed your mind
have you got an ashtray miss ?
i never seem to get an ashtray where i sit
about what ?
you mean you don 't want to go again ?
no not particularly
isn 't that enough ?
no it 's not enough oy miss !
what are you going to do ?
i 'm going to get the bill
i 'm about fed up with you lf you don 't want to go i do
oh all right i UNknown l come too oy miss !
oh don 't let 's have a row
i 'm sorry
here that will cover it
oh no now i said that i 'd see you home and i will
but i 'm only just around the corner
do you know whites ?
the UNknown ?
then we 'r e neighbors
have you ever seen an artist 's studio ?
no i 'd love to
come up and see mine
oh i can 't now
are you frightened ?
you are frightened
yes that 's what i thought at first
what is the time ?
not very late
yes of course she does
do you trust me ?
if you like
excuse me miss
always pestering people up and down this street
well here we are
i say i 'm awfully sorry
i won 't be a minute
you start walking up

have you seen him before
yes the same gent what called here several times
thanks very much
what a lovely room
i think i UNknown l light the fire
oh that ?
how do you hold this ?
oh lord not like that
let me show you
now you hold the brush
i UNknown l go and get those drinks right you are
i say how would i do for one of your models ?
that 's an idea
do you mean put it on ?
yes why not ?
besides i have to go home soon
would you have really ?
yes but perhaps you are right
it wouldn 't suit you
i bet it would
yes will you ?
yes i think so
you haven 't said how you like it
wait a minute where is this trouble ?
i can 't do it all up
wait a minute it isn 't quite right
put your hands there
please give it to me
all right come on out
there it is
don 't be silly
let me go !
mr UNknown !
it 's only b
what number did you say ?
seven or eleven ?
right you are sir
what do you think ! ?
there 's been a murder last night round the corner
they tell me the police are round there now
we UNknown l all be murdered in our beds soon i 'm sure we will
cause i don 't think the police are what they were morning alice UNknown UNknown about the murder ?
yes i heard
no but here you UNknown l find it in the book
i mean some murders are so different to others aren 't they ?
pushed his lady friends under the water when they was having a bath
what was his name you remember
i think that was ever so beastly pure gave me the UNknown after i read about it i didn 't dare 'a ve a bath for a month
an for weeks after that i only used to 'a ve a rinse down
what was his name ? you remember smith wasn 't it ?
what 's wrong alice ?
you don 't look very cheerful this morning
you do look a little bit UNknown i must say
dad alice breakfast
mind you i don 't think meself it 's all together the police 's fault
what i mean is they 'a ve to wink at some things
i mean it 's one thing to buy chocolates out of hours but it 's quite another to stick a knife into a gentleman
i must say i feel the same way about that too
a good clean honest whack over the UNknown ad with a brick is one thing something british about that
but knives ? no knives is not right
i must say that 's what i think and that 's what i UNknown l keep
whatever the provocation i could never use a knife
now mind you a knife is a difficult thing to handle
i mean any knife mumble mumble knife mumble mumble knife mumble mumble a butcher 's knife
alice cut us a bit of bread will you ? knife mumble knife mumble mumble of a knife you come up against a knife mumble
i mean in chelsea you mustn 't use a
you might have cut somebody with that
no not yet
i can 't stand here gossiping all day like some people
chatter chatter chatter give em a chance to talk about other people 's business and they UNknown l take it
what 's the matter alice ?
had another row with frank ?
another customer alice
yes they put me on it
did they ?
well i hope you get him frank !
if they do that will mean promotion won 't it ?
d UNknown ou UNknown 'n you UNknown l get him soon ?
well uh i i don 't know
well i came in here to phone
that 's all right
well i must be going now
good bye mrs white good bye mr white
now you two
why don 't you tell me ?
look you know where i found that ?
it 's the only piece of evidence that you were there
i 'm keeping it back at present
for god 's sake say something !
if you 'r e not using the phone uh may i ?
i uh i want to get on to scotland yard
no thanks that can wait
what does he mean ?
very well sir
i UNknown e got a
i ve got UNknown UNknown clay or corona corona ?
no nothing yet
no no news
what the hell business is it of yours anyway ?
you know i looked everywhere for that other glove last night
but of course you detectives are better trained at finding these things
ah here we are sir
excuse me will you ?
is it all right sir ?
yes i thought the top was broken but it 's all right
have you a light ?
yes here you are
uh all right sir ?
oh ha of course sorry
is this gentleman a friend of yours frank ?
well we 'r e not exactly friends
at least not yet
i UNknown l look after the shop father
you go and finish your paper
what for ?
rather unfortunate that poor man died around the corner last night
look here you
d UNknown ou know there are some men who would make money out of a thing like that
what a chance for blackmail
oh oh that 's awful
i couldn 't do a thing like that
let me give you a tip
don 't wave important clues in telephone boxes
they UNknown e got glass doors
you know uh detectives in glass houses shouldn 't wave clues
come on out with it
what do you want ?
what do i want ?
UNknown well uh
mother this is a friend of frank 's
he 's a very important friend of frank 's
i UNknown l get the breakfast for him
won 't you take my chair ?
about half past ten sir
did you write this ?
i 'm afraid i couldn 't tell you sir he had his hat on
did you notice anything particular about his clothes ?
well ah he had a black hat and a loose kind of collar
nd a tie and that 's about all i think
was he dark or fair ?
well you couldn 't say he was a blond and you couldn 't say he was a brunette
he was a bit of both you know kind of UNknown
anything else ?
that UNknown l do to go on with
how much longer is that man going to stay ?
don 't tell me he UNknown l be here to dinner
don 't make things awkward mother
it means a lot to to me and frank
well i don 't see why they should carry on their business in my parlour
i UNknown l take it
you are very clever
a pal of yours at the yard said he thought you might be here
oh all right
on the other hand perhaps it 's fortunate
for us that is that a suspicious looking man with a criminal record was seen hanging around the place
that won 't get you anywhere
also rather unfortunate that scotland yard are at present looking for that man
i say frank !
oh and what 's that ?
before we get to any hanging i shall have quite a lot to say
and the first thing i shall say is that she was there too
oh you will will you ?
isn 't there one thing you seem to have forgotten that our word 's as good as or perhaps a bit better than that of a jailbird
so we UNknown l face that when the time comes
meanwhile we UNknown l just sit quietly here until the squad van arrives
that surprises you doesn 't it ?
no it doesn 't surprise me in the least
when it comes the surprise won 't be for me
very well then we are both satisfied
yes we 'r e both satisfied
it 's my word against hers
frank you can 't do this
why not ?
you don 't you don 't
why can 't you let her speak
you mind your own business
in any case she UNknown l speak at the right moment
look here frank
i UNknown e got nothing against you
you UNknown e got nothing against me
except of course i i had some cash from you but i wasn 't serious
well look here have it back now
well can 't you see that she wants to chuck it up too ?
and so do i you know
look here miss
and we shall all of us burn our fingers
i 'm not bad really i only things have gone wrong lately and one 's got to live you know
all right then
that 's it ?
i say it 's not me you want
it 's him ask him
why his own
called to see frank ?
then you UNknown l have to fill out one of these forms you know
well i suppose you 'r e going to tell him who did it miss
come in please
you UNknown e something to tell us about this case
well you see
is this worthwhile sir now that everything has been cleared up ?
let 's hear what she 's got to say
what i was going to say is this
i 'd better say what i have to say now
i would rather not wait what i wanted to say is
i was the one one moment please
i shall be busy for a minute
i did it
it 's too terrible
did she tell you who did it
i suppose we UNknown l soon have lady detectives up in the yard eh
and i shall be all right on the UNknown won 't i
ladies and gentlemen
electric word life
but i 'm here 2 tell u
there 's something else
what do you want ?
i have an appointment with the manager
no you don 't

the kid must UNknown e forgotten who owns this club
i got to make some changes
it 's the second time he 's missed
i 'm telling you he 's fucking up
you know what you need to do ?
you need to get rid of him
the last three bands that came out here went on to be big stars
i thought the kid was next but he 's ruined it
he ain 't even pulling them in
he just plays a lot of shit that nobody wants to hear
like his old man francis l
did he ever mess his career up !
ruined his wife 's too
now the kid 's doing the same shit
i hear he 's having a problem with his band especially lisa and wendy
they won 't be together for long
i 'm telling you you need to get rid of him
i need to get somebody commercial
something that will work every night
like a girls group ?
yeah a girls group
i got enough problems
i put together something hot and the kid is out right ?
it 's kind of dead in here
where is everybody ?
that 's nice
think tonight this place UNknown l be jumping ?
well i UNknown l be here
why didn 't they give it to me themselves ?
i liked it and wanted to listen to it
they told me to give it to you when i was done
you really liked it ?
oh lord !
you 'r e going to make my boys look bad
let us come up with our own steps
we tried that
so what 's the matter ?
your shoes on too tight ?
let 's have some action !
let 's have some asses wiggling
i want some perfection
this ain 't happening
we should be doing better
any ideas ?
why don 't we find out where she lives ?
i already got that
what are we waiting for ?
let 's go !
i 'm the only star in town

it 's all i dream about
and you ?
will you help me ?
what UNknown ?
i don 't believe it !
how could you do that to me ?
damn you !
are you sick ?
that was a rotten thing to do
i 'm sorry
i must have looked ridiculous

the girl has expensive taste but can she sing ?
as fine as she is she doesn 't have to know how to sing
i want you to work the floor
what for ?
you see her come get me
not if i 'm with my other babes
that wouldn 't be cool
i don 't want to break their hearts
we ought to have a signal
you got it
as far as i 'm concerned
say the password !
it 's the password
the password is what
the password isn 't it it 's what ?
did you hear it ?
i knew it
he probably dropped it under his bike and rolled over it
i think you 'r e being full of shit
forget it wendy
every time we give you a song you say you UNknown l use it but you don 't
you think we 'r e going behind your back
you 'r e being paranoid as usual
shut up lisa !
you should know by now that we wouldn 't put a dark cloud over your head
it 's just to make you feel good
you UNknown e felt this way with us before remember ?
the UNknown for best actress are
fuck it wendy
he 's been doing fine without it
next thing you know you UNknown l want to use his motorcycle
you can really hurt people
doesn 't that mean anything to you ?
doesn 't that make you feel like shit ?

maybe it was a UNknown or an UNknown from mars
that 's what it is
it 's an UNknown from mars !

i wiil mom
found your pet
i 'm trying not to wig out here

that the soil of the moon UNknown more gold than the one of the earth
one day will come when a spaceship will go to the moon
and will bring back its gold on earth
the progress won 't stop by the fault of a few ignorant scientists whose brain expresses only UNknown ideas !
professor i took my decision i UNknown l go
but not without me helius not without me !
your ideas will finally prevail professor

but i beg you come
i wouldn 't ask you to leave your engagement evening
if it was not absolutely necessary
we come UNknown helius !
allow me to introduce myself
my name is turner
i won 't even try to catch you
mr helius the most clever thing
till the coming of miss UNknown and m UNknown
is to speak together
the police is already warned m turner
just as a precaution m helius like this
an other precaution m turner ?
i understand now m turner
why you are not yet in jail !
what a flatterer you are m helius !
maybe can you reveal me
where is the manuscript
five people among the UNknown and the most UNknown
want to UNknown the stock of gold of the earth
a document of a great interest ladies and gentlemen
to prove that the moon is not UNknown
helius sent there the experimental remote controlled rocket h 32
its blast was observed
thanks to the talent of our representative
i can show you a lot of things
that helius has not yet revealed to the science !
the surface of the moon filmed by the rocket h 32 during its first voyage around the moon
the remote controlled rocket h 32 and its recording and automatic shooting devices
the reactor of the rocket
in the head
the camera connected to a clock
the long focus lens
earth 384 000 km
UNknown field of the moon
first shots of the moon 36 hours after the launching
distance from the moon about 40 000 km
h 32 flies over the UNknown crater at about 1000 km
the UNknown w h pickering observatory of UNknown UNknown ca thinks he observed insects UNknown
the lens sees what none UNknown eye can see
the dark side of the moon
some mysterious smooth UNknown of very great dimension
there would be an atmosphere on the dark side of the moon trace of life even
why should we lose more time ?
i hope for my part that the gold of the moon
in the case it would really exist
will be manage by business men and not by unreliable persons
at this moment our representative reveals our intentions to m helius
in a very concrete way
you have only two possibilities m helius
either you go on the moon being in our service
or you won 't go
if we can 't find an UNknown
5 UNknown after i leave your yard and your rocket
will be only a heap of ruins
what interest would you have in killing me mr helius ?
an other escort would show less consideration !
you still not realize mr helius
we prefer destroy all your plans rather than know you exclude us from it
tell your chiefs m turner that i have not the intention
to establish a criminals settlement on the moon
grant me 24 hours of reflection
dear helius !
he won 't deceive you
don 't worry for the plans !
the copies are in a secret drawer of my desk !
my dear hans if i were you i wouldn 't be so sure !
why did you hide us helius
that you wanted to undertake this trip to the moon ?
when we worked in the laboratory
you often called me your good mate
do you want to offend me now ?
i didn 't want to lie to you UNknown
i just wanted to avoid hans being torn
between his love for you and his professional integrity !
do you seriously believe helius
that hans could let you down ?
no helius you won 't go to the moon without UNknown
and without me neither !
did you forget UNknown
to the memory of karl petersen
heinrich v UNknown olaf UNknown et bernard o UNknown UNknown the UNknown pioneers lost in space
they lives and they died for a great cause
honor UNknown memory
i couldn 't bear to know you in danger
and almighty god what a danger !
he decided to go to the moon hans
when do we leave ?
who come with us ?
in exactly 24 hours
the explosion is not important m helius
it 's just a way to UNknown my UNknown
the first warning will destroy a shed only
the second will cost some human UNknown
the third will UNknown the rocket
don 't compel me to use more radical measures
and between two evils choose the lesser me !
i give you my word mr helius that during the hour after an agreement would be found
you will be given back all the equipment which was stolen
the rocket UNknown is ready to take off
when the moon will appear the rocket will rise into space
and if god wants it 36 hours later
we will land on the dark side of the moon
the sirens UNknown in all the factories
in all the trains and all the ships of the world
in honour of the pioneers of the spaceship
i must warn you during this last hour
you UNknown and you m turner
UNknown is not concerned and you UNknown !
UNknown for ther last time i implore you
don 't implore me helius ! i
do you want helius to humiliate the woman in me ?
all the eyes of the world are staring at us
all the ears of the world are listening to us
everybody at his post we take off in 50 UNknown !
all the eyes of the world are staring at us
all the ears of the world are listening to us
the rocket UNknown at this moment its launching area
the rocket was to light to be standing upright
it 's UNknown in a basin
in which it 's floating UNknown
from the launching and until the moment it UNknown
the necessary speed of 11 UNknown per second
a fight will be given for the UNknown
and against the feeling of death suffered by the human body
when it UNknown the speed of 40 m per second
during 8 UNknown we UNknown l feel crushing loads
weighing on us as to bring us back to earth
we have to win this fight otherwise
if we can 't UNknown the speed at 11 200
we will move away always more at a UNknown speed
lost in space for ever
with no hope of return
the speed UNknown i take care of it UNknown !
60 seconds remaining !
10 seconds !
let 's turn back !
perhaps he is dead !
i think that josephine need a cognac !
m turner seems more to need some !
can 't you see
will you finally tell me you little rascal
how did you land up here ?
since i was born
the UNknown of the moon the monster stuck his claws
the secret of the UNknown UNknown
at odds with the mad cow from space
UNknown is back on earth
our earth where is our earth ?
on our earth the sun rises
UNknown of the spaceship UNknown
the rocket move on to the dark side in front of the sun so as to capture the heat
all is alright on board at 227 000 km from the earth
we move now without UNknown force
we are in UNknown conditions
we are getting closer
for the previous reasons we are back in gravity conditions
we turn the rocket in the direction of the route so as to be able to UNknown the speed at any time and to avoid to crash on the moon
we are about to reach the dark side of the moon
earth is only like a vanishing star
we UNknown l see it again hans we UNknown l see it again !
when will we land finally ?
if it remains to us a bit of good sense
we won 't land !
do you scare you coward ?
tell him that he has not the right in the name of his ambition to endanger our UNknown !
it 's not the good moment for this kind of speech hans
close all !
the moon is waiting !
we first have to test the atmosphere to know if we can breathe outside !
do what you want !
all that interests me is go away from here !
know UNknown that when the rocket will be repaired
i il demand that we go back on earth !
nor helius neither UNknown couldn 't prevent me !
you plan to act behind helius back ?
and you you plan to act behind my back ?
now helius will have to UNknown to undertake the return UNknown !
but helius is convinced that that we will find a source !
do you know what we are sure to find here ?
for god 's sake you must not to open !
if he opens and if there 's no air
we are lost for ever !
he took the UNknown rod !
it seems that the rod leads him !
UNknown would follow these tracks mr helius !
the most important is to look for water !
i have enough to do with the repairing !
can i propose myself to find the professor ? and find water ?
the atmosphere is UNknown
turner is after UNknown 's track for 3 hours and he is looking for water
since when is gustav your secretary ?
i can 't stay here any more i go and look for UNknown !
from miss UNknown so that you have something to eat !
do you have somebody on earth
to greet a last time from you
if we come back ?
the bottles of oxygen were damaged by bullets !
what does it mean miss UNknown ?
let 's pray god that it will have no consequence !
we lost more than half of the oxygen !
one of us won 't be able to return on earth !
one of us must stay on the moon !
yes UNknown one of both of us !
do you know what does it means you ?
to stay alone here on the moon
because you didn 't want to listen to me !
the shorter you lose the longer you win
we must to draw thrice ok ?
come on you !
it would be easier for you hans
if i UNknown l stay on the moon with you ?
i have an only wish come back to earth !
let 's drink to a good return journey for everyone of us
to a good return journey for everyone of us hans !
the camp is ready m helius !
now gustav you have to prove to me
that i can count on you !
i stay on the moon
it 's you who UNknown l take over the controls during the takeoff !
do you want mr UNknown to die ?
and his fiancee miss UNknown ?
the violent shakes during the takeoff will wake them up
after mr UNknown will take back the controls
dear hans i know that you won 't let me down
i UNknown l wait quietly and with complete confidence that you come back for me
greet UNknown from me !

if it remains to us a bit of good sense
we won 't land !
do you scare you coward ?
tell him that he has not the right in the name of his ambition to endanger our UNknown !
it 's not the good moment for this kind of speech hans
close all !
the moon is waiting !
we first have to test the atmosphere to know if we can breathe outside !
do what you want !
all that interests me is go away from here !
know UNknown that when the rocket will be repaired
i il demand that we go back on earth !
nor helius neither UNknown couldn 't prevent me !
you plan to act behind helius back ?
and you you plan to act behind my back ?
now helius will have to UNknown to undertake the return UNknown !
but helius is convinced that that we will find a source !
do you know what we are sure to find here ?
for god 's sake you must not to open !
if he opens and if there 's no air
we are lost for ever !
he took the UNknown rod !
it seems that the rod leads him !
UNknown would follow these tracks mr helius !
the most important is to look for water !
i have enough to do with the repairing !
can i propose myself to find the professor ? and find water ?
the atmosphere is UNknown
turner is after UNknown 's track for 3 hours and he is looking for water
since when is gustav your secretary ?
i can 't stay here any more i go and look for UNknown !
from miss UNknown so that you have something to eat !
do you have somebody on earth
to greet a last time from you
if we come back ?
the bottles of oxygen were damaged by bullets !

let 's pray god that it will have no consequence !
we lost more than half of the oxygen !
one of us won 't be able to return on earth !
one of us must stay on the moon !
yes UNknown one of both of us !
do you know what does it means you ?

greet UNknown from me !
god bless you florida !
thank you !
look there 's ben UNknown
he 's often in my dreams
and the taxi driver guy
he was there too
was it a dream ?
we want UNknown !
it was election night 2000 and things seemed to be going as planned
in new york al UNknown is our projected winner
the garden state is green for UNknown
we project mr UNknown the winner in delaware
this state has voted with
excuse me one second
mike i wouldn 't do this if it weren 't big
florida goes for al UNknown
UNknown announces that we call florida in the al UNknown column
then something called the fox news channel called the election in favor of the other guy
fox news now projects george w bush the winner in florida and thus it appears the winner of the presidency of the united states
all of a sudden the other UNknown said
hey if fox said it it must be true
all of us at the UNknown made a mistake and projected florida in the al UNknown column
it was our mistake
well first it helps if your brother is the governor of the state in question
you know something ?
mark my words
then make sure your side fights like it 's life or death
this talk about UNknown is UNknown
president bush !
and even if numerous independent investigations prove that UNknown got the most votes
if there was a UNknown UNknown UNknown won the election
it won 't matter as long as all your daddy 's friends on the supreme court vote the right way
while i strongly disagree with the court 's decision i accept it
what we need now is acceptance
we have a new president elect
it turns out none of this was a dream
it 's what really happened
mr president and i take great pride in calling you that i must object because of the overwhelming evidence of UNknown deliberate fraud and an attempt to suppress UNknown
the chair must remind members that under section 18 of title 3 united states code no debate is allowed in the joint session
thank you mr president
not signed by a member of the senate
the senate is missing
unfortunately mr president it is not signed by one single senator
i have no authority over the united states senate and no senator has signed
mr president it is in writing and signed by myself and several of my UNknown from florida
a senator is needed but missing
is the objection in writing and signed by a member of the house and a senator ?
the objection is in writing and i don 't care that it is not signed by a member of the senate
the chair will advise that the rules do care and the signature of a senator
not a single senator came to the aid of the african americans in congress
one after another they were told to sit down and shut up
it 's a sad day in america mr president when we can 't find a senator to sign the objections
the gentleman will suspend
what do we want ?
stay back !
the plan to have bush get out of the UNknown for the traditional walk to the white house was UNknown
bush 's UNknown hit the gas to prevent an even larger riot
no president had ever witnessed such a thing on his UNknown day
and for the next eight months it didn 't get any better for george w bush
he couldn 't get his judges appointed he struggled to pass his UNknown and he lost republican control of the senate
his approval ratings in the polls began to sink
he was already beginning to look like a lame duck president
with everything going wrong he did what any of us would do
he went on vacation
if i hit every shot good people would say i wasn 't working
it was not surprising that mr bush needed some time off
being president is a lot of work
what about these folks that say that you 'r e taking too long of a vacation ?
they don 't understand the definition of work then
i 'm getting a lot done
you don 't have to be in washington to work
it 's amazing what can happen with telephones and UNknown
thank you so much
karen hughes is coming over
we 'r e working on some things
and she UNknown l be over here
we 'r e working on a few things a few matters
i 'm working on some UNknown
we 'r e
we UNknown l be announcing them as time goes on
the first time i met him he had some good advice for me
governor bush it 's michael moore
behave yourself will you ?
go find real work
anybody want some grits ?
i love nature getting in the truck with my dogs
UNknown love to dig the soil looking for bugs
it was a summer to remember
afterward he left texas for his second favorite place
on september 10th he joined his brother in florida where they looked at files and met important UNknown
he went to sleep that night in a bed made with fine french UNknown
do you suppose he 's pretty confident on those numbers on UNknown security forces ?
make me look young
yeah just don 't turn it up too much
i don 't want to blow my head off
i got a mike here if they want to use it
testing one two
testing one two
testing one two three four five
we have something that has happened here at the world trade center
we noticed a flame and an awful lot of smoke
this is horrible
come on let 's go !
oh my god !
on september 11 th UNknown nearly 3000 people including a colleague of mine bill weems were killed in the largest foreign attack ever on american soil
the targets were the financial and military headquarters of the united states
if anyone has any idea or they UNknown e seen him or knows where he is to call us
he 's got two little babies
two little babies
when informed of the first plane hitting the world trade center where terrorists had struck just eight years prior mr bush decided to go ahead with his photo opportunity
good morning boys and girls
when the second plane hit the tower his chief of staff entered the classroom and told mr bush the nation is under attack
as bush sat in that florida classroom was he wondering if maybe he should have shown up to work more often ?
should he have held at least one meeting since taking office to discuss the threat of UNknown with his head of UNknown ?
maybe bush wondered why he had cut UNknown UNknown from the fbl
i believe the title was bin laden determined to attack inside the united states
a report like that might make some men jump but as in days past george w just went fishing
as the minutes went by george bush continued to sit in the classroom
was he thinking i UNknown e been hanging out with the wrong crowd
which one of them screwed me ?
was it the guy my daddy 's friends delivered a lot of weapons to ?
was it that group of religious UNknown who visited my state when i was governor ?
or was it the UNknown ?
in the days following september 11 th all commercial and private airline traffic was grounded
the UNknown has taken the action to close all of the UNknown in the united states
even UNknown the president 's father former president bush on a flight forced to land in milwaukee
thousands of travelers were stranded among them ricky martin due to appear at tonight 's latin UNknown awards
not even ricky martin could fly
but really who wanted to fly ?
no one except the bin UNknown
we had airplanes pick up
UNknown bin laden 's family and other UNknown and transport them out of the u s
the white house approved planes to pick up the bin UNknown and numerous other UNknown
at least six private jets and nearly two dozen commercial planes carried the UNknown and bin UNknown out of the u s after september 13th
in all 142 UNknown including 24 members of the bin laden family were allowed to leave the country
UNknown 's always been UNknown as the black sheep in the family that they cut off all relationship with him in UNknown
it 's more complicated than that
UNknown has had contact with other family members ?
bin UNknown ?
that 's an exaggeration
you had about 24 members of bin laden 's family and
on the other hand we understood the high emotions so with coordination with the fbl we got them out
this is retired fbi agent jack UNknown
before 9 11 he was a senior agent on the joint fbl cla al UNknown task force
i as an investigator would not want these people to have left
i think in the case of the bin laden family it would have been prudent to hand the UNknown out have them come in get on the record
you know get on the record
that 's the proper procedure ?
we held hundreds of people for weeks and months at a time
did the authorities do anything when the bin UNknown tried to leave ?
they looked at their passports and they were identified
that would happen to us if we left the country
if you hear anything let us know
can you come downtown give a statement ?
how long ?
mine 's worth money
what was going on here ?
we need to know more about that
it needs to be the subject of an investigation
what happened ?
those young guys and cops and firemen that ran into that building never asked a question
and they 'r e dead
and families lives are ruined
and they UNknown l never have peace
that 's right
not a minute
not even the biggest civil UNknown
you know you got a lawyer ?
it isn 't because i think you 'r e anything
i just want to ask you the questions that i would anybody
can you imagine in the days after the oklahoma city terrorist bombing president clinton helping to arrange a trip out of the country for the mc UNknown family ?
what would have happened to clinton if that had been revealed ?
burn him !
i do very well
they 'r e really lovely human beings
he is the only one i never
i don 't know him well but i met him only once
what was the circumstance under which you met ?
this is ironic
he came to thank me for my efforts to bring the americans our friends to help us against the UNknown the communists
isn 't it ironic ?
he came to thank you for helping bring america to help him
and now he may be responsible for bombing america
i was not impressed
a simple and quiet guy whose family just happened to have a business relationship with the family of george w bush
is that what he was thinking about ?
because if the public knew this it wouldn 't look very good
was he thinking you know i need a big black marker ?
in early UNknown in a speech during the new hampshire primary i called george w bush a deserter from his time in the texas air national guard
in response the white house released his military records in the hopes of UNknown the charge
what bush didn 't know is that i already had a copy of his military records UNknown obtained in the year 2000
and there is one glaring difference between the records released in 2000 and those he released in UNknown
a name had been blacked out
in UNknown two UNknown were suspended for failing to take their medical examination
one was george w bush
and the other was james r bath
in 2000 the documents show both names
but in UNknown bush and the white house had bath 's name blacked out
why didn 't bush want the press and the public to see bath 's name on his military records ?
perhaps he was worried that the american people would find out that at one time james r bath was the texas money manager for the bin UNknown
bush and bath had become good friends when they both served in the texas air national guard
because he 's a guy who 's always tried to UNknown his father he went into the oil business
he founded an oil company UNknown which was very good at drilling dry holes that nothing came out of
but the question has always been where did this money come from ?
now his dad was rich
his dad could have done this for him but his dad didn 't do this for him
there 's no indication daddy wrote a check to start him off in his company
so where did george w bush get his money ?
i 'm george bush
bush 's good friend james bath was hired by the bin laden family to manage their money in texas and invest in businesses
and james bath himself in turn invested in george w bush
UNknown UNknown 7 UNknown drilling all the bush companies
whenever they got in trouble there were these angel investors who flowed money into the companies
the question is why would UNknown who had all the oil in the world go around the globe to invest in this lousy oil company ?
yes it helps to be the president 's son especially when you 'r e being investigated by the securities and exchange commission
two months later UNknown announced losses of more than 23 million
we looked at which companies gained from september 11 th
we turned up this company carlyle group a UNknown UNknown that UNknown in heavily government UNknown industries like UNknown health care and particularly defense
both george w bush and george h w bush worked for the carlyle group the same company that counted the bin laden family among its investors
the carlyle group was holding its annual UNknown conference on the morning of september 11 th in the ritz carlton hotel in washington d c
at that meeting were all of the carlyle UNknown james baker likely john major definitely george h w bush though he left the morning of september 11 th
UNknown bin laden who is UNknown bin laden 's half brother was in town to look after his family 's investments in the carlyle group
all of them together in one room watching as the planes hit the towers
with all the weapons companies it owned the carlyle group was in essence the 11 th largest defense contractor in the united states
thanks a lot
september 11 th guaranteed that united defense was going to have a very good year
just six weeks after 9 11 carlyle filed to take united defense public and made a one day profit of 237 million
but sadly with so much attention focused on the bin laden family being important carlyle investors the bin UNknown eventually had to withdraw
bush 's dad though stayed on as senior adviser to carlyle 's asia board for another two years
he receives daily cla UNknown which is the right of any ex president but very few ex presidents actually exercise that right
or is he representing an investment firm in the united states ?
or is he representing both ?
this company is about money not UNknown to run the world or engineer political UNknown and things like that
it 's about making money and it 's about making a lot of money
and they UNknown e done very well
i could get you on the record on this question
okay let 's say one group of people like the american people pay you 400 000 a year to be president of the united states
but then another group of people invest in you your friends and their related businesses 1 4 billion over a number of years
who are you gonna like ?
who 's your daddy ?
that 's how much the UNknown UNknown and their associates have given the bush family their friends and their related businesses in the past three decades
seems like a very nice reunion with friends
it buys a lot of love
sooner or later this special relationship with a regime that amnesty international UNknown as a UNknown human rights UNknown would come back to haunt the bushes
now after 9 11 it was an embarrassment
and they preferred that no one ask any questions
investigation should have begun on september 12th
there 's no reason it shouldn 't have
three thousand were dead
first bush tried to stop congress from setting up its own 9 11 investigation
it 's important for us to not reveal how we collect information
that 's what the enemy wants
and we 'r e fighting an enemy
when he couldn 't stop congress he then tried to stop an independent 9 11 commission from being formed
the president 's position was a break from history
independent investigations were launched after pearl harbor and president kennedy 's assassination
but when congress did complete its own investigation the bush white house UNknown 28 pages of the report
the president is being pressed by all sides to UNknown the report
u s officials tell nbc news most of the secret sources involve UNknown arabia
we UNknown e given extraordinary cooperation with UNknown kean and hamilton
we haven 't gotten the materials we needed and haven 't gotten them in a timely fashion
will you testify before the commission ?
this commission ?
what it will do is the hole that 's in my heart and has been in my heart since september 11 th
i lost my husband of 15 years
i am now by myself
i need to know what happened to him
i know what i got back from the autopsy
that man was my life and i have no plan
i was taking a class and they asked me what was i gonna do in the next five years
and if i 'm not doing something with this i don 't know what reason i have to live
so it 's very important
the lawyers the UNknown defense minister hired to fight the 9 11 families ?
the law firm of bush family UNknown james a baker
so right here in the center of three important american UNknown the UNknown hotel and office building the kennedy center over there and the embassy of UNknown arabia
i UNknown e heard figures as high as 860 billion
eight hundred and sixty billion ?
a lot yeah
it seems like a lot
well in terms of investments on wall street in american UNknown it 's roughly 6 or 7 percent of america
they own a fairly good slice of america
most of that money goes into the great blue chip companies
UNknown UNknown the largest stockholder is a UNknown
UNknown time warner has big UNknown investors
so i read where like the UNknown have a UNknown dollars in our banks of their money
what would happen if they pulled that UNknown out ?
a UNknown dollars ?
can i speak to you for a moment please sir ?
how are you doing ?
good how you doing ?
steve kimball with the secret service
we 'r e just UNknown information
are you doing a documentary on the UNknown arabian embassy ?
even though we were nowhere near the white house the secret service had shown up to ask us what we were doing standing across the street from the UNknown embassy
we 'r e not here to cause any trouble
what 's going on yeah
i didn 't realize the secret service guards foreign UNknown
not usually no sir
the u s state department provides him with a six man security detail
considering how he and his family and the UNknown elite own 7 percent of america it 's probably not a bad idea
prince UNknown was so close to the bushes they considered him a member of the family
they even had a nickname for him
were they UNknown or comparing notes ?
why would UNknown 's government block american UNknown from talking to the relatives of the 15 UNknown ?
why would UNknown arabia become reluctant to freeze the UNknown assets ?
the two of them walked out on the truman balcony so that UNknown could smoke a cigar and have a drink
in the distance across the potomac was the pentagon partially in ruins
i wonder if mr bush told prince UNknown not to worry because he already had a plan in motion
you come in september 12th
you come in september 12th to plot our response to al UNknown
let me talk about the response you got from top administration officials
on that day what did the president say to you ?
did he ask about any other nations other than iraq ?
no not at all
were his questions more about iraq than al UNknown ?
and the reaction you got from the defense secretary UNknown from his assistant paul UNknown ?
donald UNknown said
let 's bomb iraq
that didn 't make much difference
the reason they had to do afghanistan first was it was obvious al UNknown attacked us
and it was obvious that al UNknown was in afghanistan
americans wouldn 't stand by if we 'd done nothing on afghanistan
the united states began bombing afghanistan just four weeks after 9 11
mr bush said he was doing so because the UNknown government of afghanistan had been UNknown bin laden
we will smoke them out of their holes
we 'r e gonna smoke them out
we UNknown l smoke him out of his cave
let 's rush them and smoke them out
for all his tough talk bush really didn 't do much
well what they did was slow and small
they put only 11 000 troops into afghanistan
there are more police here in manhattan
more in manhattan than there are u s troops in afghanistan
the president UNknown the response
he should have gone after bin laden
the u s special forces didn 't get into the area where bin laden was for two months
two months ?
who in their right mind would do that ?
perhaps the answer was in houston texas
a company headed by a man named dick cheney
and who else stood to benefit from the pipeline ?
bush 's number one campaign UNknown kenneth lay and the good people of UNknown
only the british press covered this trip
it 's a horror let me tell you
i 'm sorry to your husband
he must have a difficult time with you
here is the UNknown official visiting our state department to meet with u s officials
when the invasion of afghanistan was complete we installed its new president UNknown UNknown
who was UNknown UNknown ?
he was a former adviser to UNknown
bush also appointed as our envoy to afghanistan UNknown UNknown who was also a former UNknown adviser
i guess you can probably see where this is leading
faster than you can say black gold texas tea afghanistan signed an agreement with her UNknown countries to build a pipeline carrying natural gas from the UNknown sea
oh and the UNknown ?
oh they mostly got away
as did UNknown bin laden and most of al UNknown
terror is bigger than one person
and he 's a person who 's now been UNknown
so i don 't know where he is
i just don 't spend that much time on him to be honest with you
didn 't spend much time on him ?
what kind of president was he ?
i 'm a war president
i make decisions here in the UNknown office in foreign policy matters with war on my mind
with the war in afghanistan over and bin laden forgotten the war president had a new target
the american people
fox news has obtained an fbi bulletin that warns terrorists could use pen guns like in james bond filled with poison
a possible terror threat
but where ?
be on the lookout for model airplanes packed with explosives
the fbi is warning UNknown may be considered particularly at risk for UNknown
could these cattle be a target for terrorists ?
and how do you make them afraid ?
well you make them afraid by creating an aura of endless threat
they played us like an organ
they raised the orange up to red then they dropped it back to orange
i mean they gave these mixed messages which were crazy making
the world is changed after september the 11 th
it 's changed because we 'r e no longer safe
fly and enjoy america 's great destination spots
we have entered what may prove to be the most dangerous security environment the world 's known
take your families and enjoy life
terrorists are doing everything they can to gain even UNknown means of striking us
go down to disney world in florida
it 's like training a dog
you tell him sit down and roll over at the same time dog doesn 't know what to do
american people were being treated like that
it was very very UNknown and ugly in what they did
we must stop the terror
i call upon all nations to do everything they can to stop these terrorist killers
they will continue in my view as long as this administration is in charge of every once in a while stimulating everybody to be afraid
just in case you forgot
it 's not gonna go down to green or blue
it 's never gonna get there
there clearly is no way that anyone can live constantly on edge like that
the reality facing american families is they 'r e not as safe as they used to be
drug dealers and UNknown looking for their next fix
gangs who roam the streets in search of their next victim
and the growing threat of terrorists means the need for protection is ever greater
and now that protection is here
UNknown engineering UNknown has developed and tested a safe room finally UNknown to the average american citizen
protection formerly UNknown only by the wealthy or powerful
heck you can be sitting in here drinking your finest bordeaux and enjoying life while chaos is UNknown outside
every family in america should prepare itself for a terrorist attack
now to escaping from a UNknown
john rivers is the UNknown of the executive chute corporation
good morning to you john
good morning matt
it 's an emergency escape chute
it 's an option of last resort
how high do you have to be in the building for that chute to actually take effect ?
you only have to be on the 10th floor or above
they can put this on themselves ?
it 's real easy to put on
when you first get this chute you 'r e gonna wanna put it on and try it on a few times yourself
jaime 's having trouble putting that on
is this something that you honestly think in a moment of panic that someone can operate properly ?
it 's okay
despite the raising of the terror alert level residents here continue with their christmas errands
frances and her family do some last minute holiday shopping knowing al UNknown is planning to attack
she says being in UNknown doesn 't make her feel any safer than if she was in new york city
UNknown is close by and i said detroit 's not that far away
i said that could be something
and flint could be something
be concerns for people around here
you never know where they 'r e gonna hit
it 's tiny UNknown virginia population UNknown
such an attack could generate UNknown fear that even here in rural small town america no one is entirely safe
on the news there was an alert in UNknown
what did the fbi tell you ?
well they contacted me by phone
basically let me know about this were it UNknown
that 's how it started
in the so called chatter they pick up they wasn 't sure UNknown
there 's a UNknown county UNknown river
there is a UNknown
this is UNknown not UNknown
is there any target around here ?
not that we can think of
it can happen anywhere
UNknown mart probably
oh everybody does that
when i look at certain people i wonder oh my goodness
do you think they could be a terrorist ?
never know what 's gonna happen
never trust nobody you don 't know
and even if you do know them you really can 't trust them then
from UNknown to UNknown to every town and village in america the people were afraid
and they turned to their leader to protect them
but protect them from what ?
meet john UNknown
the voters preferred the dead guy
so george w bush made him his attorney general
he was sworn in on a stack of bibles
because when you can 't beat a dead guy you need all the help you can get
during the summer before 9 11 UNknown told acting fbi director thomas UNknown that he didn 't want to hear anything more about terrorist threats
mr watson had come to you and said that the cla was very concerned that there would be an attack
you said that you told the attorney general this fact repeatedly in these meetings
that correct ?
and you told the staff according to this statement mr UNknown told you that he did not want to hear about this anymore
is that correct ?
but UNknown 's justice department turned a blind eye and a deaf ear
but after 9 11 john UNknown had some brilliant ideas for how to protect america
the patriot act adopted by congress and signed by bush six weeks after the attacks has changed the way the government does business
the patriot act allows for searches of medical and financial records computer and telephone conversations even for the books you take out of the library
but people we spoke to say they 'r e willing to give up liberties to fight UNknown
maybe that 's a good thing
it 's sad but it has to be done
yes something needed to be done
these are the good people who make up peace fresno
a community group in fresno california
unlike the rest of us they received an early lesson in what the patriot act is all about
each week they meet to discuss matters of peace
they sit around they share stories they eat cookies
some have more than one
this is aaron stokes a member of peace fresno
the other members liked him
he had come to the meetings he went with us
we go out on friday nights and stand on a very busy corner in fresno
and he had gone with us he had handed out fliers
he went with us in june to a UNknown protest
then one day aaron didn 't show up to the meeting
my friend dan and i were reading the sunday newspaper and when i picked up the paper in the local section aaron 's picture caught my eye
he was actually deputy aaron UNknown and he had UNknown their group
sheriff pierce made it very clear that yes aaron UNknown was assigned to UNknown peace fresno that he was able to UNknown organizations that are open to the public
you could understand why the police needed to spy on a group like peace fresno
just look at them
this is barry UNknown a retired phone worker from UNknown california
barry likes to work out in the gym
somewhere between his UNknown and his strength training barry got political
but he UNknown l never be as big an asshole as bush who bombs all over the world for oil profits
barry didn 't have to worry about the police spying on him
his fellow UNknown were more than willing to turn him in
i was taking a nap and i guess it was 1 30 2 00 in the afternoon
and they came to my place and i said well who 's there ?
and they said the fbl
i said the fbl ?
why are they here ?
yes the fbi had come to see barry
and they weren 't there to UNknown
the fbi said have you been talking to people about UNknown and bin laden
and oil profits and afghanistan ?
i said a lot of people are talking about these things
i feel my rights have been you know trampled on
i mean if you have something to say to me in the gym well then fine
don 't tell the fbl and they come to my apartment while i 'm taking a nap
nothing to be ashamed of
there 's full UNknown
i have a 1 800 number
if you UNknown e got a poster child on this i wanna see it
i 'm hired by the people to provide oversight
i provide oversight
maybe now we can do things we UNknown e wanted to do the last 10 years
no a dictatorship would be a heck of a lot easier no question about it
i mean they had all this on the shelf somewhere
ideas of things they would like to do
and they got UNknown
go for it
that there had to be a surrender of certain of our rights
there 's troubling UNknown in the bill
the definition of terrorist it 's so UNknown that it could include people who
they wait till the middle of the night drop it in the night print it in the night
and the next morning when we come in it passes
how could congress pass this patriot act without even reading it ?
sit down my son
do you really know what that would UNknown if we were to read every bill that we passed ?
well the good thing it would slow down the UNknown process
i couldn 't believe that virtually no member of congress had read the patriot act before voting on it
so i decided the only patriotic thing to do was for me to read it to them
members of congress this is michael moore i would like to read you the u s a patriot act
that 's exactly what we 'r e gonna do
my job is to secure the homeland
that 's exactly what we 'r e gonna do
but i 'm here to take somebody 's order
that 's you stretch
we all know you can 't secure the homeland on an empty stomach
and in order to remain secure everyone needs to sacrifice
especially little patrick hamilton
but here 's my favorite
the terrorist threat that was posed by his mommy 's breast milk
i thought if i put a little bit on my lips that would be sufficient because i 'm UNknown it
she looked at me and i felt like
she was telling me UNknown that
she goes you need to drink more
and of a 4 ounce bottle i wound up drinking 2 more ounces of breast milk that then because it 's touched my lips has to be tossed
while homeland security was making sure breast milk was kept off our planes they were also doing everything possible to ensure no one could light a UNknown onboard
one too many books of matches
you can have four books and two UNknown
so don 't take their UNknown away
let me see if i got this straight
old guys in the gym bad
peace groups in fresno bad
breast milk really bad
hey no problem
or was something else going on ?
this is where the pacific ocean meets the shores of oregon
over 100 miles of beautiful open coastline on our border
and thanks to the budget UNknown the total number of state police protecting it
you know just to even drive up here and look
you know i mean as far as i know there 's lots of things they could do
i don 't even wanna suspect because it just makes me ill inside
back at the state trooper patrol office thanks to the budget cuts trooper kenyon had to come in on his day off to catch up on some paperwork
for the most part especially during summer when people show up this is what they get
they close the door
it just basically explains that due to our UNknown our office is not open for administrative business
there 's a sign that explains when the office is closed they can use the phone booth to get in touch with our dispatch
UNknown enough that phone is a piece of junk
it doesn 't work very well so half the time they pick up the phone and dispatch gets static
they don 't hear anything
for tuesday there UNknown l be no troop on patrol
wednesday there UNknown l be no troop on patrol
thursday there UNknown l be no troop on patrol
you get calls all the time
people will call in a suspicious vehicle or somebody looking suspicious
and i don 't hardly ever respond to that anymore
i just don 't have the time to do it
i asked how many people do we have in oregon
on duty tonight ?
i think oregon is a prime example that homeland security is not as secure as what people would like to believe
nobody 's sent me a manual that says here 's how you catch a terrorist
if i had that manual i 'd read it
but i don 't
they just wanted us to be fearful enough so that we 'd get behind what their real plan was
my fellow citizens
on my orders UNknown forces have begun striking selected targets of military importance to undermine UNknown UNknown 's ability to wage war
on march 19th UNknown george w bush and the united states military invaded the sovereign nation of iraq
a nation that had never attacked the united states
a nation that had never threatened to attack the united states
a nation that had never murdered a single american citizen
we 'r e going to find this
i think this piece of my neighbor
young girl age 20
that 's all
there is a lot of innocent civilians that were killed
and i think that is because the u s army we came in and we knew it wasn 't gonna be easy
and pretty much at first shot anything that moved
when war happens and fighting starts it 's like we 'r e pumped up UNknown ready to go
it 's the ultimate rush
because you know you 'r e going into the fight then you got a good song playing in the background
and that gets you real fired up
ready to do the job
you can hook your UNknown player up to the tank 's internal communications system
when you put your helmet on you can hear it through the helmet
this one we listen to the most
this is the one
we picked the roof is on fire because it UNknown baghdad being on fire
at the time we wanted it to burn to get UNknown and his regime out
the roof the roof the roof is on fire
we don 't need no water let the motherfucker burn
burn motherfucker burn
urban warfare in a tank
this is a lot more real and true than just a video game
people thought it was gonna be look through the sight and shoot no
a lot of this is face to face
especially riding by after some of the bombs went off and seeing all the people on the side of the road bloated up
and all the smells around you from the people lying dead rotted
it 's a lot more gruesome than you think
we called in with some artillery and some UNknown and things
some innocent women and children got hit
we met them on the road and they had little girls with noses blown off
that was extremely difficult to deal with
you 'r e like
the UNknown UNknown and the care that goes into UNknown is as impressive as anything anyone could see
honestly i think we should just trust our president in every decision he makes and we should support that
you know ?
the majority of the american people trusted the president
and why shouldn 't they ?
he 'd spent the better part of the last year giving them every reason why we should invade iraq
UNknown UNknown has gone to elaborate lengths spent enormous sums taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction
UNknown UNknown is determined to get his hands on a nuclear bomb
he 's got them
he hasn 't developed UNknown with respect to weapons of mass destruction
he 's unable to project conventional power against his neighbors
we 'r e able to keep arms from him
military forces haven 't been rebuilt
UNknown UNknown UNknown and protects terrorists including members of al UNknown
there was a relationship between iraq and al UNknown
we 'r e giving you facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence
he 's a man who hates america
this is a man who cannot stand what we stand for
there 's willingness to UNknown himself
he hates the fact like al UNknown does that we love freedom
after all this is a guy that tried to kill my dad at one time
they got people to believe there was a threat when in fact there wasn 't one
you get told things every day that don 't happen
it doesn 't seem to bother people
the democrats were there to put a stop to all these UNknown
i UNknown l vote to give the president authority he needs
united states is prepared to lead the UNknown of the willing that will do it
when i say we will lead a UNknown of the willing to disarm him if he chooses not to disarm i mean it
who 's in that UNknown of the willing ?
you will find out who 's in it
the UNknown of the willing
the republic of iceland
so it looked like we 'd be doing most of the invading stuff ourselves
then there was also
these are men of vision
just keep invading countries
one could almost say it 's the mother of all UNknown
fortunately we have an independent media in this country who would tell us the truth
the UNknown around the president the flag and the troops has begun
and we 'r e gonna win !
you have to be with troops to understand the adrenaline
i want you to know i think navy seals rock
the pictures you 'r e seeing are absolutely phenomenal
when my country 's at war i want my country to win
UNknown opposition has faded in the face of american power
what you 'r e watching here is truly historic television and journalism
it was absolutely UNknown
an awesome UNknown killing machine
there is an UNknown UNknown in the coverage of the american press in general
am i UNknown and UNknown ?
you damn well bet i am
but one story the media wasn 't covering was the personal story of each and every soldier who was killed in the war
the government would not allow any cameras to show the coffins coming home
that kind of story is a UNknown especially when you 'r e getting ready for a party on a boat
my fellow americans major combat operations in iraq have ended
in the battle of iraq the united states and our allies have prevailed
get out of the way !
244 u s troops
total killed 484
more than UNknown troops have been killed in iraq
the largest number of american military deaths since UNknown
there are some who feel like that if they attack us that we may decide to leave UNknown
they don 't understand if that 's the case
let me finish
my answer is bring them on
the united states was planning on walking through here like it was gonna be easy and all
but it 's not that easy to conquer a country is it ?
the renewed battle for control of iraq UNknown for a fourth day today with street UNknown in nearly every corner of the country
iraq could become another UNknown
officials say they see evidence that UNknown and UNknown UNknown might be joining forces
they 'r e not happy they 'r e occupied
i wouldn 't be happy if i were occupied either
two japanese aid workers and a journalist kidnapped by men calling themselves the UNknown squadrons
they threatened to burn the hostages alive if japan does not withdraw its troops from iraq within three days
what 's happened ?
the pentagon might keep up to 24 000 troops in combat beyond their tour
i know our numbers in the military have gone down
they talk about UNknown
i don 't think anybody did
i don 't have any clue as to why we 'r e still in iraq
if donald UNknown was here i 'd ask him for his resignation
with the war not going as planned and the military in need of many more troops where would they find the new recruits ?
military experts say three times the 120 000 u s troops now deployed would be needed to UNknown and rebuild the country
they would find them all across america in the places that had been destroyed by the economy
places where one of the only jobs available was to join the army
places like my hometown of flint michigan
i was watching tv one day and they showed some of the areas that had been hit by bombs
and while watching i got to thinking there 's parts of flint that look like that
and we ain 't been in a war
look at the neighborhood i live in
most of them are abandoned
you know i mean that 's not right
you wanna talk about UNknown ?
come right here
i e mailed him
but you have to take into consideration as well that when your unemployment runs out you 'r e no longer counted
i would say that we 'r e close to at least 50 percent not working or UNknown
because being UNknown is just as dangerous
my family has gone through the welfare system when it was job central
in the mid UNknown i came through the job training partnership program
i went to a secretary school
years later i 'm executive assistant to the president of the agency
why do you always go for the UNknown ?
it was because the UNknown is who needed me
people that don 't have anything that 's who i have to fight for
and that 's who i have fought for my entire life
i started taking my children and telling my children
the military is a good option
i can 't afford to have you go to college
i can 't pay your way
financial aid will not help you
so i as a mother started teaching my children about the options that the military could do
they would take them around the world
they 'd see all the things that i as a mother couldn 't let them see
it 'd pay for their education that i as their mother and father couldn 't pay
the military is a good option for kids in flint
the military is an excellent option for the people of flint
how many of you have a friend or a family member in the service ?
anybody currently serving overseas ?
there are people with a calling
most serve one weekend a month and two weeks a year
earning money for college
i 'm going into the air force
i 'm gonna take a year off after high school
and then make a career
i wanna be an aircraft maintenance technician
i ran into a UNknown and there was something i noticed about it
and this is kind of on another
i noticed it was odd
more like he was hiring me than recruiting me for the army
it was the way he approached me
i was in borders books and music
he came up like he was handing us a business card
he had business cards made for the army
meet marine staff sergeant dale UNknown and sergeant raymond UNknown
they are two of the many UNknown assigned to flint michigan
they 'r e very busy these days
look he 's running away already
he 's seen us coming
they decided not to go to the UNknown UNknown valley mall in the suburbs
they have a hard time recruiting young people there
instead they went to the other mall
let 's go in through UNknown 's
in through UNknown 's
gents you know we 'r e looking at you right ?
you guys ever think about joining up ?
i thought about going to college and playing basketball
travel around the world for the corps basketball team
right now somebody out there wants to be a marine but has no idea how to
i was gonna try a career in music or something
career in music ?
let the marines go for it
i 'm sure you know who UNknown is
how about a former marine ?
especially discipline with the money
if you make a million you need to manage that money
come to the office we can talk show you everything about the marines
ladies ready to join up ?
green hat right behind us
you go that way i go this way we corner them
you 'r e in the ninth grade ?
all right here 's my card
you ever thought about being a marine man ?
i UNknown e thought about it
i UNknown e got a wife and kid now
even more reason to join up
phone number ?
add another one to the list
however one would love to have that chance to experience college life
you know stuff young people can do without having the risk of dying in the process i guess i can say UNknown
the holidays add a bit more friction as opposed to just another night in the fact we wanna give our guys a little time off time to relax
however we are in a combat zone and my soldiers do recognize that fact
everybody 's a little bit nervous about it i guess
we 'r e professionals
maximum one UNknown 47
rock 'n roll
this goddamn thing to pry doors open
pop this in there
no no no no
i UNknown l go with her
where 's she going ?
she 's gonna call him
she 's gonna call him ?
no no no
not on the phone
is he in the house ?
i have one coming up
that 's UNknown al UNknown ?
what 's your name ?
we will not be long
we appreciate your cooperation
that 's our job
the ideal of democracy and freedom to the country and show them that the american people are not here to rule iraq
i start doing evidence turn in
that process takes about three hours
so that 's gonna be it for the night
that concludes christmas eve
trying to keep skies clear for you santa
do you consider yourself a proud american ?
i 'm probably more proud than the average joe
when i put my flag out i can 't allow it to touch the ground
because i know the lives that were lost and the blood that was shed so that i could be here and have a flag
i had the same flag flying on my front porch and the same yellow ribbons
praying and hoping every day that my child would come home safe
and everybody 's child would come home safe
it 's families like mine
and it 's not just my family
there 's hundreds of families millions of families that this country was founded on their backs
i have been known to be a conservative democrat
it 's a great country
a great country
that 's because i believe that all god 's people come in many colors
and my family itself is UNknown
you have a daughter who went into the military
then your first born son in the military
that 's quite a gift to the country from your family
so having a son in the army pretty proud thing
oh you know what ?
he made it
i always hated the UNknown
i always hated the UNknown
it was just a slap in my face
it was just like they were UNknown my son
and i burned in my soul to tell them you don 't understand
they 'r e not there because they wanna be there
but then i came to understand they weren 't protesting the men and women there
they were protesting the concept of the war
i know i 'm a soldier and i 'm here to do a job
i UNknown e been a soldier for a while
once you have to go and do your job and you see the things that you see i was saying there 's some UNknown in that
battalion commander fully expects us to be attacked in some type of way before we get to UNknown shell
i know that so far it 's been pretty calm
not much has happened
they 'r e beginning to organize themselves just in UNknown
the kids get together a lot
well i can 't say kids but guys about 17 18 starting to come together
they hate us
immoral behavior breeds immoral behavior
when a president commits the immoral act of sending otherwise good kids to war based on a lie this is what you get
hey is he ticklish ?
don 't tell me you don 't know
to have these people shoot at us kill us blow us up whatever means they can
and i don 't understand it
we 'r e trying to help these people and it seems they don 't want our help
get out of here !
the minute something goes wrong why weren 't you here ?
why didn 't you do this ?
you know it 's
yeah that statement is very true
you cannot kill someone without killing a part of yourself
if you get called up will you go back to iraq ?
possible jail time
i will not let anyone send me back over there to kill other poor people
especially when they pose no threat to me and my country
i won 't do it
this is an impressive crowd
the UNknown and the have UNknown
some people call you the elite
i call you my base
he tried to double the prescription drug costs for veterans and opposed full benefits for part time UNknown
to say we 'r e forgotten i know we 'r e not
but missed ?
didn 't get the proper coverage they deserved
there 's a death toll but not showing the injured or amputated
but they do a lot to help it and they take a lot of the edge off it
it makes it a lot more UNknown
i was injured in late april on patrol in baghdad
a couple of guys come out and ambushed us
i got nerve damage and stuff like that
i UNknown e got a lot of pain
i 'm constantly in pain
i take a lot of morphine to help with that and stuff
i 'm doing
you know what i 'm saying ?
i 'm not gonna do what it is that i did before
i was a republican for quite a few years
and for some reason they
they conduct business in a very dishonest way
i 'm gonna be incredibly active in the democratic party down where i live once i get out
i 'm gonna definitely do my best to ensure that the democrats win control
iraq baghdad i didn 't know anything of those things
and we were in the hallway in the upstairs of our house and he was crying and said that he was really scared
and he didn 't want to have to go to iraq
so we had a conversation about sometimes some fear is healthy because it keeps our senses about us
that 's when he told me he hadn 't told anybody else
but he knew he was going to baghdad
just glued completely glued to the television in hopes of seeing a glimpse of him
can 't you please go to where the UNknown are ?
can 't you please let us see him ?
then that night it was about 10 something i went upstairs to the bedroom
i was in bed flipping the channels with the remote
all i heard was black hawk down south central iraq
what i can tell you at this hour is that last night the army did indeed lose a black hawk helicopter
we are being told by officers on the ground that there were six occupants inside the black hawk
the next morning i got up and i said
you push those sad thoughts out of your mind
okay jesus i need you to come in
i need you jesus
the army called me and i remember getting on the phone and him saying
asking me was i lila UNknown and i said yes
and he said mother of sergeant michael UNknown ?
and i remember dropping the telephone
and all i can honestly say that i remember
is ma 'a m the united states army the secretary of defense UNknown informs you
that 's all i know
the grief grabbed me so hard that i literally fell on the floor
and i was alone
so i literally crawled over to my desk and was hanging on
and i remember screaming
why did you have to take my son ?
why is it my son you had to take ?
he didn 't do anything
he wasn 't a bad guy
he was a good guy
why did you have to take my son ?
or a wife for that matter
it was mailed march 16th but i didn 't get it until probably a week before he was killed
they took the phone seven days ago
i got the letter and box
that is so cool
how is everyone ?
what in the world is wrong with george ?
trying to be like his dad bush
he got us out here for nothing whatsoever
i am so furious right now mama
i really hope they do not re elect that fool honestly
i am in good spirits and i am doing okay
i really miss you guys
thanks for the bible and books and candy
i really look forward to letters from you guys
well tell all the family hello and that i am doing fine
we don 't expect anything to happen any time soon
i cannot wait to get home and get back to my life
tell UNknown congrats and i UNknown l see my first nephew soon as soon as i get back to the states
hope you guys are doing okay and keep sending the mail
it makes getting through the days easier
well i am on my way to bed so i will write you guys soon
i love and miss
but your flesh just aches
you want your child
a parent is not supposed to bury their child
but i really feel sorry for the other families that is losing their kids as we speak
and for what ?
for what ?
criticism is okay
we 'r e feeding the soldiers
we 'r e rebuilding iraq
will things go wrong ?
sure they will
we 'r e serving the troops because of what we know not who we know
let me tell you about UNknown the company i ran
i 'm proud of what i did at UNknown
the people are proud of what they UNknown e accomplished
and as the secretary of energy said we were caught UNknown
in the middle of the war UNknown UNknown and other UNknown invited UNknown to a conference to figure out how much money could be made in iraq
having worked this effort even since before the
the invasion the liberation of iraq started
you industry are definitely a vital part of that effort
we appreciate your interest in this
we need you
how do we get a piece of this ?
you big guys are gonna get it
the rest of us will have UNknown UNknown or none at all
UNknown is for you
it 's the second largest reserve of oil in the world
no question of how much money 's there
i UNknown e been getting complaints from UNknown UNknown and american UNknown
the lack of UNknown the corruption
i think the profits american companies are making the main companies are so overwhelming
i mean when you have a line item for a million dollars and you UNknown it out for 50 or 60 or 70 000 that 's a huge profit
it 's the american taxpayer that 's gonna pay for that
and it 's gonna get better
start building relationships
good news is whatever it costs the government will pay you
war is always good for certain companies that are in the war
the business of war
supporting u s government and military
the real heroes of the campaign and the reconstruction are the men and women of the u s armed forces
we 'r e proud of being any part we can in supporting them
UNknown delivers hot meals supplies clean clothing and communications to our soldiers so they can be a little closer to home
it 's a girl !
i just read in the paper UNknown got another contract
because nobody knows
but that 's after it happens after the fact
it 's too late
american troops guard the oil fields as texas oil workers UNknown their potential
it 's a safe environment to work in
we don 't feel any risk
we feel we 'r e being well protected here or we wouldn 't be here
it 's no secret
a UNknown employee out here driving a bus can make between 8 and 10 000 a month
explain that one to me
for 40 hours a week
driving the same two and half mile route
there 's no other single area of the world today with the opportunity for business new business similar to the opportunity that 's available today in iraq
the president went in did what he did
we 'r e supporting him and our troops
we wanna make sure that the efforts and the lost lives wasn 't for no reason
if it wasn 't for the oil nobody would be there
nobody would worry about it
unfortunately at least for the near term we think it 's gonna be a good situation a dangerous situation
good for business bad for the people
today on the news UNknown was saying
and UNknown was saying
isn 't it better that we got rid of UNknown and now the UNknown people can do what they wanna do
and really be free ?
will they ever be free ?
no they UNknown l not be free
and where are the weapons of mass destruction ?
it was a
it 's unnecessary
lila had called to tell me she was coming down from flint to washington d c to attend a jobs conference
on her break she said she was going to go and pay a visit to the white house
bush killed children
they 'r e killing all these young americans
my son is dead
blame al UNknown
that i 'm supposed to blame the al UNknown
the al UNknown didn 't make a decision to send my son to iraq
ignorance that we deal with with everyday people
because they don 't know
people think they know but you don 't know
i thought i knew but i didn 't know
i need my son
but it 's freeing also because i finally have a place to put all my pain and all my anger and to release it
i guess i was tired of seeing people like lila UNknown suffer
especially when out of the 535 members of congress only one had an enlisted son in iraq
i 'm here with corporal henderson
UNknown to UNknown 2
i UNknown e got all the UNknown
in fact only one
of course not a single member of congress wanted to sacrifice their child for the war in iraq
and who could blame them ?
who would wanna give up their child ?
would you ?
they offer to give up their lives so that we can be free
it is remarkable their gift to us
and all they ask for in return is that we never send them into harm 's way unless it 's absolutely necessary
will they ever trust us again ?
he had used weapons
around UNknown baghdad and east west south and north
there is a tie between iraq and what happened on UNknown
the struggle can only end with their complete and permanent destruction
we wage a war to save civilization itself
we did not seek it
but we will fight it and we will prevail
george UNknown once wrote
victory is not possible
it is meant to be continuous
a UNknown society is only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance
this new version is the past and no different past can ever have existed
in principle the war effort is always planned to keep society on the brink of starvation
the war is UNknown by the ruling group against its own subjects
and its object is not the victory over either UNknown or east asia but to keep the very structure of society intact
there 's an old saying in tennessee
i know it 's in texas probably in tennessee
fool me once shame on
shame on you
for once we agreed

or that is in the water under the earth
thou shall not bow
everybody loves UNknown

miracle in the town of UNknown
hard at it as always
it 's only the cultural pages
i wish we could do news again
you don 't justify your expenses !
you 'r e getting fat kid
lack of stress from you
your column seems popular
we UNknown e got one hour to the deadline !
i UNknown e got no money
despite looking like a boring dump there are the UNknown and the threatened
right old fella ?
is that all ?
you know who we are ?
we UNknown l trash you !
you 'r e slower than the cows
why 's he going to school ?
how should i know ?
get your asses into gear boys i 'm already late
late for what ?
she 's an old maid a UNknown
what on earth do you think you 'r e doing ?
a noisy old maid is she ?
he apple UNknown the vice principal
you UNknown l accomplish nothing !
our physics teacher just doesn 't get it
i 'm always here to help you
the music teacher is indifferent
you want to die ?
the gym teacher dumped her just recently
calm down dear
i used to teach a UNknown idol back in tokyo
there is one but she
miss UNknown !
if my memory serves me so were you
since you started before her you 'd best go first
calm down !
no way kid
listen do me a favor
let him jump first will ya ?
who are you ?
the substitute ?
can you take that ?
this is absurd
stupid brat !
my head !
are you all right mr UNknown ?
he 's a teacher ?
the one and only !
encouraging students to kill themselves !
totally unacceptable !
the attempted suicide UNknown UNknown is in your class
every school has one
mr UNknown !
i hope we UNknown l be safe
asses on seats now !
i didn 't do anything
class is canceled
same old script
i hate her
i expected a beautiful UNknown nurse in the clinic
she 's a bit young but she UNknown l have to do
tomato juice doesn 't wash off
it leaves a bad stain
no friends ?
you 'r e the only one who understands how i feel
bit sudden ain 't it ?
sorry about that
get my point ?
a barbecue in hokkaido
UNknown is a tough kid
then how come he has no friends ?
not in front of my teacher
who does he take after ?
this one 's afraid to talk
not in front of his teacher
i can help you study
any problems you come to me
it UNknown l be good him staying here
you UNknown e won me
do you think UNknown really wanted to die ?
what should i do patricia ?
silent type ain 't she ?
great tits though
can i borrow it ?
do what you like
this one too ?
what a fine lad
suit yourself !
is that right ?
he started the canadian village
in all its glory
i can never say i love her
are you completely stupid ?
that 's no reason !
the kid 's got no guts
i better fix things right patricia ?
ran out of gas
what a godforsaken town
trust me on this !
believe me this is for real
pig headed !
i told you
we have to
and i need this scoop
i promised patricia i would
i UNknown l tell her you gave up
if you blow this one you 'r e in big trouble
don 't you worry about me
i have this
it 's your fault !
you cut in front of us !
dreams do come true
yes it is
well found !
i 'm a substitute teacher at the local school
UNknown get the picture !
that 's her father
UNknown tokyo 26 single
i UNknown e got something to tell you it 's very important
leave it alone !
he 's like all the rest
who 's the UNknown ?
he comes highly recommended by a number of people
on the outside he may appear a trifle unorthodox
it 's more than skin deep
perhaps he may have been nervous in your presence sir
my mistake i should have made the selection
sending UNknown abroad is a timely move
this weekend ?
just the one time
are you suggesting schoolgirl prostitution ?
not suggesting insisting !
so much ?
money is important too
your classes are a waste of time
if not we UNknown l stage a walk out
at least we 'd learn something
so that 's the way it is
let 's go !
if they don 't want to study i don 't care
that 's my policy
not so fast !
so he is a teacher
but the thing is he only arrived here yesterday
that way he waits till things cool down
he 's just the type !
you reckon ?
we 'd better watch him closely
i 'm getting scared
come with us
wanna make it more fun ?
who 's going to win ?
place your bets please
he UNknown l get thrashed
we don 't know that until the fight is over
right UNknown ?
100 000 on UNknown
what are you doing this for ?
you 'r e supposed to stop fights
anyway you UNknown l fight
i 'm gonna bet on him
he 's too weird
he 's letting them fight ?
is he crazy ?
are you insane ?
you 'r e very good
well done UNknown !
very damn convenient
c 'm on UNknown let 's go
hey there 's always patricia
i 'm hungry
people betray their friends
give her a miss
i hurt my leg
i love her
i UNknown l fix that kid !
ain 't nothing like hokkaido potatoes
UNknown showed his manhood to his lady love today
i bet UNknown is thrilled
not that UNknown is it ?
he could totally ruin us
i know that
you UNknown e always got patricia
you need a drink
i don 't drink
how manly !
stop playing detective
where are they ?
you wrecked a car for nothing
let me follow up
i 'm being UNknown ?
it 's a transfer
you can take kaoru 's beat
we UNknown e got a deadline !
the old school too ?
what 's with you all ?
you see what he 's doing ?
you 'r e missing the point
skipping class again ?
only you today ?
go on get lost
stay in class
you can stay
you all want me to leave don 't you ?
so how come no one tried to stop her ?
you know what ?
i can 't stay any longer
i 'm going to london
so this is the last time i UNknown l see you
take care of yourself
it 's best for everyone
just this one last time
this hokkaido corn is delicious !
you certainly seem taken with it
i 'm far more taken with your stunning beauty
i 'm flattered
UNknown go eat
i UNknown l fix things
the thing is
spit it out
she 's leaving this weekend
that 's three days away
so it 's too late
don 't be stupid
corn will push it out
where 's my beer ?
wanna bite ?
did you wash your hands ?
she 's going to london
what should i do patricia ?
she must be really hurt
ain 't you got any friends ?
you and UNknown don 't have a pal between you
she used to have a best friend
right up to the end of last year
is that so ?
her parents lost their jobs when the park closed
the day we moved school buildings
since then she 's really changed
you weren 't even listening !
there 's nothing more boring than someone else 's sob story
she leaves in two days
you promised to do something
she wants to know more !
a journalist ?
i 'm here to give you what you want
what 's with him ?
when you come back you UNknown l see great changes
so take a good look
this will make big money
it will wipe out all the debt left by the bubble economy
good thanks to you
i UNknown l take a last look around
i won 't tell the police
i want your memoirs
what are you talking about ?
stop playing innocent
you have no choice but to confess
i ain 't confessing nothing
if you don 't confess i UNknown l never get my old job back
i 'm no criminal
let me in on your secret
would you like to try it ?
you mean this ?
you belong on the society pages
i UNknown l tell you my secret
it 's for the second time with a very special girl
what 's wrong ?
which button is it ?
come back down !
you won 't get away !
a good looking babe like that i near went and confessed
what are you doing here ?
that 's my line
police headquarters are advising of the distinct possibility that a serial criminal is hiding in our town
look everyone 's watching us
how come she gets a ride ?
so after london where will you run away to next ?
leave me alone !
what on earth ?
i 'd like to tell you all about the future
in this era of rapid change our town also needs to be reborn
so it 's no fun eh ?
he 's insane
as a first step i will demolish the old school building
a modern waste disposal site complete with UNknown
waste disposal site ?
what on earth is he thinking ?
it 's up to you to cut the rope
a great way to get hurt
ain 't you the sourpuss !
it 's coming down
starting here and spreading all over hokkaido
please allow me to introduce myself
you 'r e too much !
you ruined the assembly
that was fun up there
you disrespectful wretch !
so leave me alone
well UNknown ?
who are you really ?
like i said i 'm a teacher
you made your students fight and then bet on it
you cut the rope and made the balloon crash
you 'r e no teacher
you do prattle on don 't you ?
i UNknown l do what i have to do you go get your scoop
you got that ?
don 't say that
it wasn 't so long ago we rode bikes together
look you 'r e in big trouble and it 's me who 's paying
sorry UNknown out that
at this point i don 't care if they do catch me
but i wish it weren 't some half UNknown shabby burg like this
go out in a blaze of UNknown !
in your dreams
much ado in east hokkaido my town UNknown 9
debut column by kaoru UNknown
you UNknown e got work
head down ass up
forgive our UNknown
yes we UNknown e investigated all recent UNknown in town
there 's one suspicious character
well who is he ?
to all UNknown and purposes he 's a school teacher
a teacher ?
believe me this is best
you UNknown l soon make new friends
my town UNknown 9
in the small town of UNknown
don 't scare me
but maybe your intuition was right after all
what do you mean ?
a cop i know says the criminal was once in a UNknown gang
lots of guys were
don 't worry i UNknown l crack this case
they want the story now that the cops are on to it
you UNknown l lose your job if you blow it again
you want a transfer ?
do it right
if you wouldn 't mind
he UNknown l be back after he farewells UNknown
she 's decided to leave early
she 's so spoiled
talking in exams is cheating !
UNknown 's dad is furious at UNknown
talking in exams is cheating !
course they UNknown l fire him
you UNknown l just let her go ?
this is an examination !
will you shut up !
where are you going ?
you should be in class
quick stop him !
more important than an exam ?
education is foremost
apologize for what ?
so today is her last day with us
yes i 'm leaving town today
i had a good time with you all
this is all your family 's fault
nobody here really likes you
we want to apologize for what we did last year
it 's our fault for UNknown her like that
no need for that
besides when did i ask anyone to be UNknown 's friend ?
you always follow others
it 's as if you 'r e asleep
not one of you is worthy of UNknown
you 'r e just trash
you have an exam
you 'r e the one who doesn 't get it mr chairman
mr UNknown !
the only trash here is you
what was UNknown to you ?
the boss 's daughter ?
you pick your friends based on their parents ?
if that 's the case that 's not friendship
you go wait there
are you crazy ?
so what ?
he suddenly ran off ?
well yes we think
no one checked to see if he was genuine
all units into action
it 's not your concern
what on earth is he thinking ?
welcome back sir
leave it to us
i don 't care where you go
so leave me alone
what is it about you and this guy ?
isn 't it obvious ?
this is my big scoop !
i could sense he was a criminal
i must tell the chairman
UNknown kidnapped UNknown ?
it was never any fun living here
they make a fuss over me but they were never real friends
that don 't work on me
suspect heading for UNknown we 'r e in hot pursuit !
the problem isn 't this town and it isn 't your father
you 'r e the problem
you don 't get it
but i do
i was always alone even when i was with them
a tiny problem
okay boys let 's go
i UNknown l start with the clock tower
grow up stupid kid
you really think i can trust them now ?
so what ?
i have to !
without saying goodbye ?
we all have
we UNknown l probably get expelled
i 'm your new teacher UNknown UNknown
where 's the driver ?
30 hostages ?
blow her UNknown off UNknown
what 's wrong ?
release all the hostages and surrender now
your last chance !
don 't be crazy
one thing UNknown do what you gotta do
UNknown kidnapped her
they say he 's a teacher
a serial criminal too
your demands ?
did you tell her ?
don 't miss your chance
tell UNknown how you feel
if you don 't i UNknown l read out your letter !
who 's she ?
arrest him !
he 's a genuine school teacher
did you tell her ?
she will not !
is this your idea of a teacher ?
i don 't know but there 's one thing i am sure of
that man is a true friend
hey coppers !
he 's not the serial robber !
that 's me i am !
you want a list of what i stole ?
way to go UNknown
catch UNknown a later !
right away sir
did you know this would happen ?
when you UNknown him ?
not an inkling
more gambling ?
don 't push your luck
back to class
may i ?
mr UNknown !
no but i found a great story for my column
i 'm good at what i do
save it for her
you 'r e kidding ?
let 's go
you UNknown e been transferred again
here you are chief
want a transfer ?
music by UNknown hattori
sound recording by UNknown UNknown
edited by UNknown UNknown
ok recent studies have shown that one in four men cheats on their wives
and one in ten women cheats on their husbands
ray i will explain
now that 's UNknown
you stop talking now
he works for your husband
but then i realized imagine how much more impressive those numbers could be if people thought they could actually get away with it ?
here put these up
i will take care of the photographer
you ten minutes after that half a mile down the road there 's an UNknown garage call a cab
and well some might see this as an UNknown of our social fabric
i say business is good
ray ray my files are ready
do me a favour will you ?
double check the receipts for the UNknown account
i 'm super sorry about the other night ray
i just lost her
that 's the third time in the last three months
ray we deed three dollars for wendy 's birthday cake
that is two months UNknown
you need any contacts we UNknown l hook you up
we UNknown e got some issues with the new UNknown UNknown
give it to walter
track me down this afternoon
ray i need approval on the travel account
i did it it 's on your desk
ray this ok ?
you said you wanted bigger brains around here
don 't let the twins fool you
they may look affectionate but they 'r e actually in a battle for tank UNknown
they also like to breed under banana UNknown
you can call me lola
ok let 's go by ray ?
benjamin 's root canal is going over
also peter miller 's pass code isn 't UNknown the rhythm
and i will talk to you about it later
so lola do you have any lunch plans ?
you worked under randall UNknown
can i ask why you left ?
i was one of seventeen jr
UNknown in out division UNknown interest UNknown market risk exposure plus a little p l UNknown on the side
and just a point of UNknown i work with people and for people never under them
and what would you say your best quality ?
you look like a woman who would care
do you wanna talk about it ?
i would have guessed tibet
i 'm old school
what exactly do you do ?
well this is a surprise
by the middle east
well i wouldn 't know about that
you guys were like
i hear he was seen at the airport he 's hiding out in a UNknown just up the coast
yeah i heard it was a villa in sweden
i wouldn 't put too much stock in idle gossip
nothing idle about a 5 million dollar contract on the guy 's head
excuse me sir ?
i was looking for some good guys
ma 'a m
that was interesting little creepy
so what can you tell me about him ?
i just met him
okay what else ?
i know that jack UNknown UNknown the sultan UNknown out of 15 million dollars
yeah that 's the legend
what about this ray fellow ?
he was always just the UNknown word is after the score
jack disappeared with ray 's cut of the sultan 's cash
a sultan ?
married or single ?
what i hear 5 million open contract on jack UNknown 's head
5 million 's a lot of money
to clip a UNknown it certainly is
ok where is he now ?
no no no i will take it
so when can you start ?
you asked me two questions and offer me the job ?
we have to leave
i don 't know if ray is still in touch
he 's handsome
what good is it for man to have faith if his actions do not prove it
con men don 't reform
they simply find better angles
ok what do we do ?
we 'r e a risk management firm
which means ?
how do you do that ?
we grease the way that makes state of the art infidelity possible
people who cheat get caught because a they want to or b they 'r e found somewhere they said they weren 't
UNknown jay z incorporated ?
mr williams is in meeting right now may i take a message ?
we create a false reality making people appear to be where they 'r e supposed to be
adams and UNknown
i will try it when she gets off
can i help you ?
i can try him on his UNknown if it 's an emergency
so you help men cheat on their wives ?
and wives cheat on their husbands
we 'r e an equal opportunity employer
you 'r e a professional liar
lies are the great foundation of our society lola
great outfit honey can 't i give you flowers for no reason ?
and my personal favorite don 't worry it happens to lots of guys
but that 's just being polite
fact is your average relationship wouldn 't last two minutes if people told the truth
we just help maintain the illusion
mom 's happy dad 's happy and the kids don 't have to pick sides at christmas
so this is all for the children then ?
families don 't break up because of infidelity
let me guess you 'r e just a hard working child of a broken home trying to save others from the pain you went through
i just see people for the well dressed good smelling animals they are
mate eat sleep and mate some more preferably with someone else
not everyone operate on a purely UNknown level
a man is as faithful as his opportunities
take your old boss for example
they got back together they never been happier
when was that about a year ago ?
yeah how did you know that ?
he just bought us lunch
been a client since january
are you ready ?
you dare defy your emperor !
ok here 's the situation
in a few seconds an angry wife is going to steaming through that door and raise mary hell till she finds her cheating husband
inside this is a cheap knock off necklace
you can be anyone you want to be for the next five minutes
i need two thousand a week benefits and a month off plus all the regular holidays
we tend to work holidays we UNknown e got great dental and i can go as high as 1 500
what 's going on here ray ?
hey how ya doing there ?
one second vision ?
ok the objective is to UNknown him from this situation with his balls intact
i don 't know who you think you think you are mrs hatch but no one speaks to me like that
i can 't work like this mr hatch
we are UNknown 's UNknown not bob 's big house of diamonds
our office is in new york so
mr hatch has been flying in members of our team to work on the design
so if i want to examine some other items from your catalogue how could we arrange that ?
i can have a catalogue forwarded to your hotel room in UNknown
you didn 't tell her ?
yes mrs hatch
and in the future i 'd rather you didn 't UNknown travel arrangements
i was in the moment
i UNknown l also need a cell phone
and moment or not you didn 't have to make it a private island
we both know he had it coming
company car ?
no we don 't alibi crimes
i will not be an instrument of UNknown or revenge
so how rich do people have to be to hire us ?
we give UNknown to cops UNknown hotel workers and teachers
nice to give something back to the UNknown under paid
if it makes you feel better sometimes our clients stray but then they go back a little wiser for the experience
anything else ?
if i 'm there for more than a year i want profit sharing
ok on one condition
don 't UNknown
but i was temporarily seduced by her lavish penetrating truly sublime attention to detail
you see my current line of work is all about planning for every UNknown UNknown
accounting for every detail
i know exactly where he is
the one my old partner jack would never abide
i 'm forced on a daily basis to rely on the intelligence of others
ten days ray
you got any idea how that is ?
break the rules these thing happen
by the way you UNknown l be UNknown the necklace you gave her with a real one in about two days
i UNknown e already UNknown your account
you realize i actually had to
i shudder just thinking about it
you could always leave her robert
hey i 'd leave i 'd leave in a heartbeat it 's no secret the money 's all from her family
i leave i 'm ruined you know that
we all have our crosses to bear right ?
now for our lesson in UNknown cheating
those damned matches
nothing from your UNknown goes in your pockets on your breath or on your skin
got it ?
my son 's getting married next month
good girl from a good family
but you know the hatch men
you know we always have a little something on the side that my grandfather my father me and now my kid can you believe it ?
ray i 'd appreciate it if you handled this yourself
robert apart for the odd emergency
i do very little UNknown these days
you 'r e my last personal client
yeah but i was your first client
think of it as a wedding present to my fucking kid
one you get to bill for
after that lola takes care of me
some clients just prefer working with men
so that man was your first client ?
that man 's UNknown paid the rent for the first few months
international man of intrigue
okay jack is not a topic i care to discuss
bad break up ?
a fucking friar like what am i robin hood ?
look don 't get me wrong
i love sandy
men aren 't wired to be UNknown
i 'm sorry
your father tells me you want to go away for the weekend ?
that 's terrible right ?
i 'm a terrible person
i don 't know you wendell
yeah i guess you 'r e right
alright so this girl do i tell you her name ?
are click and UNknown going too ?
i UNknown l book you a room in san francisco under your name and reserve a flight and a rental car
friday you go to santa barbara and i go to san francisco where i check into your room and sign in at the convention
i have dinner make phone calls
in short you become me and i become you
we intercept all the calls
if there 's an emergency i UNknown l be contacted and i will contact you
i don 't
it 's kind of tacky and it UNknown l get you caught
so what 's in san francisco ?
it 's business
lola i prefer to keep my work life and my private life separate
it keeps things simple
this is fun want to keep going ?
i got a plane to catch
have a good weekend ?
but you see romance is my greatest ally
that makes people vulnerable
you sure you didn 't tell anyone ?
in short perfect clients
what did you tell your boyfriend ?
that i 'm visiting my mom
trust me he 's an idiot
so after the wedding how long before we can get together ?
i don 't know we might have to cool it for a little
oh shit does your boyfriend drive a black UNknown ?
did you ever get a blow job at a hundred miles an hour ?
we 'r e only going sixty
then you better step on it
can 't wait to do that
now what can i do for you nice young people ?
we have a room booked
takes one to know one mr williams

plus the inn keeper but
i don 't see how anyone 's gonna register in the cop 's radar
so how much do you want to make this go away ?
that 's not what this is about
i will give you 23 grand cash right now to keep my kid out of it
hey that 's what i UNknown e got
my emergency cash reserve
hello leaving the fucking conversation
our actions have consequences
i pay up and this chick shows up with my 23 grand on some beach somewhere
no way no fucking way
she 's dead
this is carol
come on man you know that i never sleep
so i heard my old friend might be in town
you heard anything ?
i UNknown e been waiting to call you
he just came in
are you sure ?
but here 's the thing jack doesn 't have a snake UNknown on his face
or a steel bolt through his UNknown
i gotta go
detective UNknown to see mr elliott
neat how that worked out isn 't it ?
you 'r e not UNknown are you ?
used to be
that 's where the prices and their UNknown wayward daughter live
what exactly do you do here at elliott consulting mr elliott ?
risk assessment and management
the same way you got to carnegie hall detective
practice practice practice
or should i call you mr UNknown mr morgan mr weil
detective i swear to god what about your old boss jack UNknown ?
would he know ?
i haven 't talked to jack in couple of years
now when UNknown and cons knock each other off
i really don 't UNknown a shit
but ms price 's father is an UNknown and he 's pushing really us hard to fine his daughter
it 's how it works he pushes me i push you
we find her
that sounds painfully domestic
now you make me stick around this town
i 'm gonna do my UNknown to just make sure that i find something to make it worthy my while
for my scrapbook
it 's a new process they UNknown e had it for a couple of years now
UNknown this will you please
what did the cop want ?
it 's nothing
not a problem
gotta go for a ride
holding me up for that b and b thing ?
that 's not like you
i 'm hurt you 'd even think such a thing
i take this is not UNknown ?
that 's a real good way to put it
so who you working for these days ?
guy used to run out of salt lake
the UNknown ?
really nice guy
e don 't really keep track
but me and bobo get benefits ; dental UNknown
nice uniforms ?
it 's a little crowded in here right now
i may be married to the old creep but he doesn 't own me
well that 's good to know so where you from young lady ?
are you insane ?
doesn 't matter who 's idea it was
he UNknown l tear your head off you go near one of his wives
you dragged me here remember ?
so let 's get this audience underway ?
i spent a fortune for UNknown but i think it 's worth it
it 's very beautiful
how does that work anyway ?
sorry do they work in shifts or is this more of a group effort ?
things manage to work themselves out
but enough about me
i UNknown e also heard he maybe in town
and you want me to tell you where he is ?
you know my chosen profession right ?
ever since some UNknown gave some other UNknown half a UNknown to clock his brother with a rock
more of a UNknown really
which is where you come in
do i ?
well i 'm sorry but i don 't alibi crimes
you UNknown one
that was the first and last
oh i think not
unless becoming an accessory after the fact strikes you as a reasonable way to spend the next ten to fifteen years of your life
good evening ray we UNknown l be in touch
the UNknown of jack UNknown was that he was part magician part artist part ghost
ray jack 's back on the radar
you guys were like batman and robin
although it was a UNknown to work alongside him
what was his name jack something ?
i UNknown e gone to great pains to leave that life behind
jack UNknown would he know ?
so i hear there 's a price on the head of your old partner
but that 's the problem with the past
bad UNknown ?
cam i can 't really deal with this right now
something came up
i will call you later
somebody needed to straight things out
i don 't know who you think you are but you don 't threaten me and you don 't threaten my father
you 'r e a fucking employee you understand me ?
you are a UNknown
so let 's step outside and get this party started
what is that ?
tae UNknown doe
it 's a little cramped in here
if you move those two chairs
and i will shift this table
you want some more of this pal ?
do you follow me ?
please don 't kill me i UNknown l pay you
go go go !
i think i did
what 's wrong with that guy ?
okay come on get in
i think there 's been a mistake
my house is that way
this ain 't no car service motherfucker
this is your worst nightmare
well my worst nightmare has rats in it
well we 'r e gonna get to that
you 'r e hatch 's driver
that 's right asshole and what is that supposed to mean ?
you think you are better than me ?
you trying to put me down man ?
what the fuck let me suggest something to you
i suggest you get real smart real fast and tell me where the fuck she is ?
look you better get smart
don 't be annoyed but who ?
little b cup ass like butter right ?
mind like fucking pervert
let me tell you something she 's my fucking girlfriend man
h it wasn 't a hotel man it was bed and breakfast
you shut the fuck up and drive keep attention man
i wasn 't at that hotel i reported my credit card stolen
i spent weekend with friends check it out with any of them
you expect somebody believe that bullshit
is that your best shot ?
it 's the truth
i get me to engage my suspension of UNknown
give me something man
she wouldn 't be cheating on me man
no matter what she 's done or why she 's ducking me
i have the capacity to forgive
unfortunately tonight is not going to be salvation to your fucking ass
do you want me to get extreme UNknown UNknown on your ass
where is she ?
alright point taken back off man back off
now where is she ?
she can 't man
you do it ?
he came to me to help him set up an alibi
the man is UNknown man
couldn 't be a little ain 't no worth
think about it hannibal
she wanted to take shower before she was with you
she ever do that ?
talk to me
shit is right man
i know where he lives
remember what about that time when we went to UNknown party and i told you we seen it
don 't do it hannibal
there 's a better way
better than shooting his ass ?
better than you going to jail to avenge a girl who was fucking around on you
better than you throwing away what you UNknown e got going on for a third strike that UNknown l get you the needle
a needle motherfucker what do you know about me man ?
what do you know about me you don 't know me man
the ink says you UNknown e been inside
and i know you drive for hatch to pay for your tuition fees
you promise he goes down ?
i can make it happen
better make it happen
you follow me ?
so i wanted to
almost kept my first one in there
told you there were rats mother fucker
it is a very bad time
can you come by ?
i was hoping we could firm up some dates for our business
i can 't tonight
what did he want ?
he wanted me to take you out
i 'm pretty sure i 'm not your type
it wasn 't some UNknown tea party ray
what did you say ?
i said it was out of the question as we have unfinished business you and i
what did he offer you ?
a man should always know his worth
your asking price is twenty three thousand
tell hatch you UNknown l take it
if you take the UNknown at least i know he won 't be hiring anyone else
you know if i had jack UNknown 's whereabouts you and i might never need to speak again
five million dollars buys a lot of forgiveness
i UNknown l see you tomorrow
what happened ?
it was hatch 's driver
why would he come after you ?
it 's better if you don 't know
i think i can decide what i can handle
he spent last weekend in santa barbara where he killed his date
and i we were on the job
i got that guy putty to take care of it
and now the cops are all over me and a very bad man has been hired to kill me
you sure this job is worth it ?
it 's not normally this bad
you ever consider asking your old partner for help ?
it 's not so easy
it makes a certain amount of sense
what that guy putty said your trip to san francisco
how much it must have cost to set up your company
plus you calling jack your boss when i really can 't see you ever working for anyone
a woman can tell when a man lies ray
if she 's paying attention and if she really wants to know
and if i can figure it out i might not be the only one
it 's funny
so who 's right ?
i know you won 't believe me ray but not everyone is working an angle
then i suppose you have a choice to make
i suppose i do
i need an alibi for thursday night
something extremely sturdy
what 's happening thursday night ?
let me explain something
but that 's all you get
and where would you want to pretend to be ?
does it matter ?
do you have five million in your checking account ?
unless you 'r e trying to tell me jack is already a non issue ?
you wouldn 't have me waste my time looking for a man who 's already passed on to the greater celestial court would you ?
anything else ray ?
excuse me ?
i kind of thought that you and ray were maybe
you thought wrong
you understand there 's a difference between wanting someone dead and doing something about it ?
and here i thought you were the UNknown captain of industry type
then let 's say UNknown you meet me here on friday with 100 000 cash
and should i bring something else ?
for you sweetie nothing 's a problem
i don 't know
there 's no rule that says you can 't make up with your husband
if you still love him
i 'm just saying
to be honest with you dorothy
i 'm not sure what i UNknown e got
oh sure you do
pretty much as expected
yes mr sykes
wendell hatch ?
we 'd like you to come down to the station and answer a few questions
how well do you know ray elliott ?
he 's involved in a missing person 's case we 'r e working
he is ?
young lady named heather price
we believe mr elliott took her to a bed and breakfast last weekend
she hasn 't been heard from since
mr elliott took her to a bed and breakfast ?
what do i always tell you about mumbling ?
no one can hear you
seems like he 's been spinning some tail to the santa barbara police department about how his credit card was stolen but we 'r e pretty sure he killed her
why would you think that i would ?
one of our officers saw you talking to mr elliott
and he says there was an UNknown at the bar
i don 't i don 't really know him
he i think he works with my dad sometimes and i i was in this bar and he was he was drunk really drunk
were there words exchanged ?
only this time in a hostile UNknown
yeah there were words but there were just
hey you jerk
we never talked about any missing
i hope you find this guy cause that 's terrible
hey you know what ?
we always get the bad guy
as a matter of fact the owner of the bed and breakfast coming in and take a look at some pictures
have you been to this place ?
shady grove in santa barbara
no i i haven 't been
we want to mix in some photos with mr elliott 's
you know give the guy some faces to choose from
i mean don 't you have to ask my permission before you do that ?
you don 't mind do you ?
he 's not going to pick you out so
what 's the harm ?
no it 's just
it 's shady grove
you UNknown e just one a night of total luxury in beautiful los angeles
all for being a loyal UNknown to b and b magazine
yes we 'd remove all the outstanding items from your bill plus we UNknown l give you a small credit
you got it
yes i 'd like one dozen
okay no problem
that 's right
who 's bob ?
don 't let her out of your sight
where you going ?
was wondering when you 'd show up
hold that thought
that was from you ?
ray you 'r e gonna spoil me
you know i think i am
now can you come to the UNknown hotel at six fifteen pm ?
i UNknown e got us a room
i UNknown l have no miss choir practice
i can write you a note ?
okay maybe i 'm no casanova
and maybe i 'm in way over my head
but this was always jack 's job i was the pencil pusher
the UNknown expert
jack was right i should never have gone straight
i need a piece
you know a gun
let me show you what we UNknown e got
ever get the feeling you 'r e running out of leads ?
this is walsh
think we might have something
this guy i have watching hannibal picked up something going down this afternoon at the UNknown hotel
how good is your guy ?
good enough to supply a room number
worth a look right ?
are you sure this is gonna work out ?
low ranks circus ?
i 'm off to church
you clear it with the boss ?
i go every thursday but you can check with the choir master if you want to
we got that thing anyway
that is why if we stay cool things are going to be just
what tells you to tell me stay cool
i am cool alright ?
little piece of shit just arrived
god damn it
tell me what 's happening
he just left
how about that ?
otherwise people are going to get seriously hurt
and wendell will walk
hey holmes !
i like a man who takes direction
why don 't we go up to your room and talk ?
my grandfather 's staying here
and what 's your grandfather 's name ?
i won a contest
may i help you ?
my name 's UNknown
a magazine kind ?
let 's get the business out of the way first
you 'r e sure you still want to get rid of ray ?
i 'm not a man prone to second thought
and you haven 't found anyone else ?
you UNknown l never know for sure but i promise you won 't be UNknown
take care and keep an eye on
now i don 't know about you bobby but i 'm feeling pretty dirty
can 't i watch ?
where you been ?
so i think i need to tell you something
i 'm actually a huge opera fan
that 's what you needed to tell me ?
but i always preferred carmen to salome
you know why ?
hey lola are you okay ?
yeah i 'm ready
i know these things that we can do with the water jets
i tell you what
can i help you ?
i 'm looking for ray i mean bob
he 's a guest here
are you UNknown ?
and i 'm not
mostly cheats killers and cons
and i happen to trust these people
or at least trust on their UNknown instincts
let 's hope they don 't disappoint me
boss you better down
i don 't like this
mr UNknown i think we need to get you out of here
hell no !
i swear it was her
i 'm gonna kill him
then i UNknown l pray for god to UNknown him so i can kill him again
i 'm sorry ?
i don 't know just tell me
if there are any roberts or god damned UNknown in the hotel or i will come down there and personally shove that phone
i have a first initial 'r
you try to cover all the basis do your homework
at the end of the day
it 's the people you trust
i 'm not a huge UNknown of that word
i prefer UNknown to human nature any day
sometimes you just have to roll the dice
come on in the water 's fine
i ask you a question
my name is robert hatch
bob hatch ?
what 's going on here ?
to be honest i 'm not quite sure
i UNknown e never seen this old guy before in my life
he 's lying !
hey boss !
suppose we will
step back into your suite
maid reports an UNknown UNknown male
possible shooting victim
victim identified as jack UNknown
i just wanted to make sure it was a good match
you just couldn 't stand the idea of you not leaving a good looking corpse
UNknown 's gonna be the death of you ray
let 's hope
and then some
what are you gonna do with the money ?
assuming the sultan actually pays what he says ?
i don 't know
enough warmed over lawrence of arabia UNknown
you 'r e from the boston
where i have people
here 's a new spin
if one in four men cheats on their wives
then three in four are faithful
and even more admirable nine in ten women
not bad odds to play
so no more jack no more alibis no more worries
just the thought of waking up every morning and hearing
you are such an asshole
sometimes it helps if you don 't know the whole story
so where should we go ?
it 's up to you
you said you UNknown e already been to the holy land
i also mentioned not everyone is working an angle
i 'm not sure about asia
how 's london
time fixed by UNknown
UNknown UNknown ichiro yuki
hey your egg is broken !
my egg ?
look the well cooked one is mine
we 'r e sharing since we 'r e friends
since we 'r e friends i accept the other half without embarrassment
then came a work for them bound by a good friendship
we UNknown l take you back home in this truck
but i don 't have a home
no parents ?
we 'r e UNknown
a morning like any other at UNknown and UNknown 's place
i 'm the one cooking !
don 't UNknown !
isn 't it time to go to work ?
to take care of the house during our absence
we don 't have time for a break !
it 's not the time for a break !
fighting is sacred !
do you want to try it now ?
at a night party UNknown meets UNknown a student of the neighborhood
they get to know each other
lately they start feeling a strong sentiment of love for each other
the day of the departure of the young couple
the end directed by UNknown ozu
but we are really pressed for time
where did this come from ?
it was being transmitted live to a computer
did you trace it ?
we tried but the signal was cut off about 2 1 2 hours ago
do you think sara 's still being held there ?
we have no reason to believe otherwise
now please does anything in that room look familiar to you ?
what do you see ?
i see my wife praying that her husband will do everything in his power to bring her home safely
if these people want wallace UNknown confirmed to the supreme court if that 's what it UNknown l take to save sara 's life fine
they UNknown e got my vote
my people are tearing this apart UNknown by UNknown but you got to give us a chance
the UNknown committee is scheduled to meet first thing monday morning
you UNknown e got two days
he 's going to give in to the demands
voting to confirm UNknown
who stands to benefit the most from sara collins kidnapping ?
that would be the honorable judge UNknown himself
but graham do we really think that a federal judge would resort to kidnapping and blackmail ?
either he 's that desperate to get on the court or somebody really wants to put him there
i have to have a full UNknown on UNknown
bureau 's gone over his background for the nomination process
if i pull his packet it UNknown l send up red flags from here to dc
that 's why i haven 't done it already
then we 'r e
then we 'r e going to have to fly under radar
part of the case file
that 's right
judy you better get out here
looks like you just got UNknown
but 12 years ago ?
is it possible your memory 's grown fuzzy ?
no i remember it like it was yesterday
and you had no idea who this young woman was ?
bodies wash up here now and then
what is this ?
but she had a name tag on her like a waitress wears
it said nicky and i i assumed the police would figure out nicky who and i i pretty much forgot about it
until you saw the news report on sara collins disappearance ?
yes i saw that good looking reporter judy something saying how the senator 's wife led a double life
and she went by the name nicky johnson
but you believe that was simply a case of mistaken identity that the body you found 12 years ago is the real nicky johnson ?
from what i saw she was the spitting image of the collins woman
and i could see how anyone would mix the two up
but you can take my word for it
nicky johnson 's dead
all right get me an address on the UNknown 's fisherman
judy phone !
he wants you upstairs
you know i i really hope they find that collins woman
i caught your performance
you said all the right things
well i aim to please
permission to come aboard ?
granted if you got the cash
i UNknown e got you covered
that 's what i like to hear
where is sara collins ?
i have no idea
who were you sending that message to ?
what does this mean ?
it 's just a tattoo ; a lot of guys find ink a turn on
want to see my other ones ?
well we found this tattoo on four convicted UNknown
they were all murdered
maybe you don 't get it
you are looking at spending your life behind bars unless you give me something
you tell me where sara collins is we can make a deal
i UNknown l pass
i can protect you
we can protect you and they believed it
now you can talk all you want
i 'm done
i UNknown the story bob
i had approval from the managing editor
how hard did you look at this nicky johnson ?
i went to gloucester
i went to that bar she worked at
did you even check the morgue records ?
did it occur to you that she might be dead ?
no but there was no indication
judy i brought you up from local news because i had faith in you
i 'm telling you someone is trying to erase sara collins past
are you even listening to what you 'r e saying ?
that 's what i 'm trying to find out
you 'r e going to issue a UNknown and you 'r e going to make an apology to the senator
but my story is good
i had two sources
if you 'd seen that tape you 'd be backing me up right now
sara collins is nicky johnson
obviously your cameraman doesn 't agree
your UNknown was the only one UNknown onto the system when the file was wiped
you think adam erased the file ?
maybe he cares about you as much as i do
we wouldn 't want to see you ruin your career
you erased our copy of peter manning 's tape ?
quit screwing around
why the hell would i kill our story ?
you tell me
the computer log said you UNknown the file
no for just quiet listen
forget about these logs
this has got to do with us judy
we UNknown e been together for almost a year now and you really think i 'd screw you over like that ?
i don 't know
well maybe you should find someone a little more trustworthy than me
good luck with that by the way
we 'r e finished
so how close were we ?
according to the city planning office it 's 9 400 give or take
so what 's our next move ?
get 9 000 search warrants give or take ?
UNknown take a breath
she was right in front of us
we were so close
i 'm sorry but without an active signal there 's just there 's nothing to trace
this is the best i can do
but what if you can get the signal back ?
it could take some time to UNknown the frequency but in theory yeah
all right get to work
thank you for coming to meet me
i had a rough day
i needed a drink
not here for happy hour
of course you 'r e not
what can i do for you ?
well as a journalist you can make an open records request access the documents of public officials their phone records financial statements tax returns
let 's cut to it whose records do you want ?
judge wallace UNknown 's
i UNknown l have them UNknown over to your office
you UNknown l label them confidential ?
of course but i want something in return
i can 't make any promises
i had evidence a UNknown that proved that sara collins lived in gloucester massachusetts 12 years ago under the name nicky johnson
yeah i 'm sorry
so the real nicky johnson 's
they UNknown a body
analyze that body
i UNknown l have the remains transferred here
you know we should really help each other out more often
while we believed at the time of our report it was accurate we acknowledge now it was premature
i apologize sincerely for any pain my report may have caused the collins family during this extremely trying time
judy though at the same time there has been a new development in this case
officer i 'm senator collins
my son was in an accident
that 's correct sir
i 'm fine
why is he in handcuffs ?
sir he 's an UNknown minor with a blood alcohol level twice the legal limit
dad i just want to go home
jeff he 's drunk and he stole your car
maybe you should let him handle this
you want him to be arrested ?
i know that you think you 'r e helping but
let 's go
i was just looking for my sweater
i keep my clothes in here
mom what is this ?
it 's nothing
a little girl
i thought it was something your father should know about
that 's why you came back
so you could mess things up with him and sara
i never showed it to him
when sara disappeared and i saw how devastated he was how much he loved her
i changed my mind
this is sara 's secret and he doesn 't need to know right now
i shudder to think that someone like judy nash can dig up so much crap on our lives
thomas jefferson said he 'd rather have a free press than a standing army
there is nothing incriminating about UNknown here
i mean the guy gets his oil changed at UNknown UNknown every six months to the day
he has season tickets to the braves and
oh look he adopted a cat
that 's nice
he UNknown a number registered to jeffrey collins nearly 20 times in one month
no i didn 't say he called jeffrey collins phone
i said he called a number registered to jeffrey collins
i UNknown e called the senator a dozen times in the last week and this is not his phone number
hi it 's UNknown
does that mean what i think it means ?
if they were having an affair that would explain why jeffrey 's turned against him
you think ?
maybe the judge needed some UNknown that their little secret wouldn 't become a national scandal
when was the last time you talked to wallace UNknown ?
just answer the question
those are the judge 's phone records
he called you 18 times in one month
it must be some kind of billing error
no it 's not
you called him 20 times in the same month
we were seeing each other okay ?
it 's over not that it 's any of your business
UNknown does anyone else know about this ?
sara caught us
that 's why you two were fighting
she could have kept her mouth shut
but miss high and mighty had to tell my father that wallace was sleeping with an underage girl
she just didn 't name names
and that 's why your father won 't vote to confirm his old friend
are we done ?
eight months ago
i guess he didn 't listen to you UNknown UNknown he called you again two months ago
the day he was nominated
i wonder what he wanted
it was a mistake
you talked to him for ten minutes
yeah i did
even if it was UNknown you were only 17
if you say anything i i UNknown l deny it
UNknown we cannot
it won 't bring sara back
it UNknown l only hurt people
sir my people are working on that 24 7
well that 's it ?
i 'm sorry sir ; that 's all the information that i have for you UNknown time
well you 'r e preaching to the choir
then why haven 't you returned my calls ?
i UNknown e been busy trying to salvage my reputation
yeah well what about mine ?
you convinced me to go on tv and tell the world about nicky and then you apologize for the story ?
you made me look like a fool
i 'm going to call my editor
sweetie the truth isn 't the truth unless you can prove it
well thanks for going the extra mile
don 't jerk me around
sara collins parents the UNknown they 'r e in town
why haven 't you put them on the air ?
they won 't talk to the press
but they might talk to you
shouldn 't you be packing ?
i was just thinking the same thing about you
well you UNknown e only got a day and half before the vote
there 's plenty of time
you really don 't want to take the red eye and walk straight into a public hearing
those tv cameras are brutal
it 's only a two hour flight
i hope you 'r e planning to do the right thing
excuse me ?
why do you suddenly care about my vote ?
i care about you
that 's not my problem
the hell it isn 't
holding up this vote jeffrey is political suicide
is that really what you 'r e worried about ?
my career ?
max and UNknown may be your children but this is not your family
i never meant to hurt you
of course you did
i don 't know what you think you 'r e doing by moving back here but sara 's coming home soon and you UNknown l be gone
you 'r e blowing this way out of proportion
it UNknown l never happen again
give me a break
he needs to be in UNknown
i 'm not sending him off to some boot camp
it 's not like that okay
it 's a place where max can get some help
i 'm right here !
making one stupid mistake does not make my son an alcoholic
look max is a great kid okay but you 'r e not here all the time and you don 't see everything that goes on
the phone calls from school
j t handles it
it 's nothing dad
jeffrey he could UNknown e killed himself
professor lawson university of georgia
nice to meet you
i was consulting with the bureau in an arson case
well this is the sword and the UNknown symbol of UNknown UNknown
this is the cross and the crown which represents the knights UNknown the UNknown of modern UNknown
these came from a civil war graveyard we came across during our investigation
is this why you had me come down here ?
you think the UNknown kidnapped sara collins ?
actually that is the real reason i called you in
we got the UNknown UNknown right off but it just doesn 't seem to fit in with the other letters
now we know that the upside down g is quite common in UNknown UNknown but we can 't seem to find this UNknown version in any text
well i UNknown e never seen anything like it
could be of medieval or UNknown UNknown
there are dozens of UNknown UNknown each with their own vocabulary of symbols and UNknown
i 'm sorry
guys zach 's got something on the feed
just one moment
and i UNknown e been UNknown UNknown
the station must still be active on the other end
as soon as we hit the right frequency we establish an UNknown
how long till you can give us a location ?
i UNknown l contact you from the van
all right set up a perimeter and search it
alpha team set up a perimeter
i want a bird in the air looking for heat signatures
talk to me zach
what do you see ?
come on sara 's feed is live and it 's coming from your exact location
i see nothing
we got jack here
it can 't be more than 50 yards from where you 'r e standing
yeah and i 'm telling you i 'm standing in the middle of an empty field
sara 's feed is coming from your location
well could they be bouncing it off somewhere else ?
i guess so but they need a transmitter out there
all right pan around a little
it all looks pretty standard
we UNknown e got commercial cell phone UNknown a big old cable tv transmitter
whoa whoa whoa go back !
that black box
you see any markings on it ?
a manufacturer 's UNknown serial number anything like that ?
no there 's nothing
for the UNknown vote
you know a reason why i shouldn 't ?
he 's a creep
don 't ever think that
none of us could UNknown e seen this coming
i guess i have you to thank
i hadn 't really noticed
it 's basically a cell phone UNknown
it 's not even a particularly trick one
and it was UNknown a feed of sara collins back to quinn 's UNknown ?
there are thousands of them UNknown on cell towers across the southeast
there 's no telling where they originated
she could be anywhere
serial numbers on these UNknown trace back to the federal emergency management agency
UNknown kidnapped sara collins ?
the network 's part of an emergency UNknown system that was put in place about a decade ago
it was supposed to be used in case of a national disaster
the kidnappers hacked into the system
they UNknown e been using this as their own personal phone company
until quinn UNknown told them to pull the plug
where 's agent UNknown ?
he 's a little busy today
so he dumped me off on you
agent UNknown called in a few favors and got your jane doe from gloucester
what 's this ?
now since the skull doesn 't determine eye or hair color we had the artist match it to sara 's
the bone structure 's nothing alike
your jane doe doesn 't resemble sara collins
i knew it
uh look if you UNknown e got what you needed
i 'm all good
what did they want to talk about ?
more of the usual
did sara mention any new friends ?
how many times can they ask the same questions ?
that 's what i told them
you know when sara gets back she 's going to be very excited about your baby
oh we UNknown e been trying but
i hope you UNknown l let her
i 'd like to talk to you about your daughter
you were on the news
that 's right
we don 't have anything to say to you
you know she disappeared before
why won 't you talk about it ?
you heard my wife
look i care about sara
tell me why she ran away back then
get out of here
tell me why she pretended to be nicky johnson
dad is everything okay ?
just get back in the room UNknown
is that nicky 's daughter ?
she 's our daughter !
how old is she ?
you come back here again i UNknown l call the police
what are you doing ?
i UNknown e been going over this frame by frame
check it out
watch it again
you get those kind of UNknown all the time
all right let me single frame it
do you think video UNknown make shadows ?
i UNknown l page zach
i don 't understand what you want me to do with this
we make UNknown adams and that entire network look like amateurs
and how do we do that ?
we put it on the air
can anyone identify this woman ?
we can prove that she 's not nicky johnson
you put the photo on the air the story becomes
judy nash versus UNknown adams
i 'm interested in sara collins
a story any reporter would kill for
now get out there and cover it
someone taking pictures ?
get me the weather satellite data for yesterday at 16 04
it was clear as a bell yesterday
yeah in atlanta
so we find the lightning strike we get closer to sara
weather satellite images coming up
16 04 yesterday
she joins us here in the studio with more on what she 's learned today
despite news that the fbi had apprehended a second suspect yesterday 33 year old atlanta resident quinn UNknown there appears to have been no further movement in the investigation
senator collins released a brief statement announcing that he plans to be in washington on monday for the confirmation UNknown of supreme court UNknown wallace UNknown
and inside sources say the senator will support the nomination of a UNknown friend
as for the fate of sara collins the fbi will only say that they continue to UNknown through a significant and growing body of evidence
according to the fbl 's public information office the UNknown has received over 5 000 tips
sadly the one tip that sara 's family has been praying for the one that will lead to her safe return has failed to UNknown
we 'r e clear
double check your targets
previously on vanished
you 'r e being blackmailed your wife for your vote
wallace UNknown is a federal judge
are you going to tell dad ?
i 'm under a cloud
and you put me there jeff
i 'm giving you a dignified out wallace
but you can take my word for it
nicky johnson 's dead it now appears that the wild stories of sara collins secret past are nothing more than that stories
what are we looking at ?
streaming video feed
take a look
what 's the scenario ?
sharp force trauma
i think she took the first blow when she was about here
UNknown knocked her down
she stumbled down tried to get away
UNknown took another swing
these drag marks from where she tried to crawl away
the final strike was to the neck
she went down about there
bled out till her heart stopped
you break a story about sara collins having a mysterious past you UNknown e got to expect the rest of us to check it out
no offense but that 's journalism 101
if you say so
hmm i 'm sure you 'r e about to tell me
you 'r e taking it out on me because your boss made you apologize on national television
sara collins is not nicky johnson
i want contact information on the man you interviewed who supposedly recovered nicky 's body
your guy 's story was crap
give me his number and when i prove it i won 't force a UNknown
not a chance
you mean don 't i find it a little odd that he called me instead of you ?
well considering how low your ratings are
i 'm surprised he even knew your name
you don 't own sara collins you never did
UNknown this may shock you but it 's not about owning a story it 's about getting it right
and UNknown the closest you 'r e going to get to sara collins is watching my broadcast
coop it 's judy
no sweetie it can 't wait till morning
i 'm on my way
got the dna results from the cabin yet ?
it 's coming in now
that 's sara 's dna profile this one 's the blood from the crimes scene
all right UNknown them
how sure ?
sleep doesn 't come easy right now
do you mind if i sit ?
there was a lot of blood
we identified it
i 'm sorry
any other circumstances
but i know the kidnappers promised you that if you vote for UNknown that they 'd release her
i was going to vote for him
i would have done it
why couldn 't you have just let me give them what they wanted ?
i heard a crash
no one 's here but you
whoever took sara
she 's not coming
are you sure you 'r e okay ?
i UNknown l survive
i 'm fine UNknown
you didn 't forget right ?
i 'm sorry
just give this to her afterwards
she UNknown l like it
you 'r e still taking care of me huh ?
it 's okay
there 's something else
i UNknown e been meaning to give it to you and
i mean i don 't even know if you want it
i just didn 't want it to get lost
all it will take is a quiet word
don 't do this to yourself
what am i supposed to do put on a black suit and write a UNknown ?
i 'm going to settle with these bastards myself
jeffrey how can you possibly ?
they wanted me to confirm UNknown !
i don 't know why and i don 't care anymore
i 'm going to take him down
jeffrey you cannot UNknown the president like this
i know you are in pain but the political consequences
screw the consequences
jeffrey can we talk please ?
i don 't know what to say except that i know how much you loved her and i 'm sorry for everything
i don 't know
i UNknown l be here for the kids for however long you need
ladies and gentlemen this is now a homicide investigation
until the body 's recovered that information will not be released
and it will be no contact with the media without my consent
any evidence or any leads that you come up with go straight to agent UNknown who remains lead investigator on the case
i know you UNknown e worked hard
you UNknown e given a hundred percent to finding sara collins
well i want you to give that same effort to finding the bastards who killed her
i want 30 agents UNknown the area surrounding the cabin UNknown UNknown gas stations
knock on every door that isn 't already open
UNknown evidence response team works the grid search
you find a tire track we want to know who made it
the cabin 's ten miles outside of stone mountain
check every credit card purchase made there within the last 72 hours
folks somebody 's murdered the wife of a u s senator and i want answers fast
cause if he really wants to help now is the time
graham you can 't contact someone whose name you don 't even know
maybe i can
this will be a brief statement and i will not be taking questions
again the plate begins UNknown
if you have information it is urgent that you come forward at this time
if you have any information it is urgent that you come forward at this time
what the hell was that ?
you trying to contact whoever left the nathan cards aren 't you ?
don 't you think it 's worth a shot ?
you talked to the media without consent
on top of which you feed them false information
the fbi has not UNknown as to what events took place at stone mountain but speculation is that sara collins may be hidden somewhere in the outlying area
i UNknown e done everything i can to protect you
that courtesy 's over
until then you 'r e on administrative leave
you know we have people who do this ?
not as well as me
i followed up on the fbi statement
turns out there is no van white or otherwise with georgia registration containing the sequence UNknown
let me share a little truth with you about broadcast news
we don 't pay you six figures a year so you can bury yourself down here in the archives second guessing the fbl
you 'r e an on camera reporter judy
that means you 'r e value to me is your face
now if you want to keep chasing UNknown fishermen and phantom panel UNknown speak up but that 's not the reason i sign your checks
just trying to get you a story
then stop playing junior detective and get your ass to d c
you 'r e sending me to washington ?
our d c bureau got a tip ;
senator collins is on his way to washington
the wallace UNknown confirmation UNknown are back on
one shot only
i want to thank you for coming by
of course but i wasn 't clear
and we will
i have concerns about his ex wife
we looked into jessica when sara first disappeared but we found nothing pertinent
i can tell you that the senator would be very grateful
i don 't see how i can
a man like yourself on the rise can always use a bit of political capital
unfortunately the information we develop in the course of an investigation is strictly confidential
and i heard a loud voice coming from the throne saying
i 'm glad you made it behold god 's dwelling is among the human race for the old order has passed away
the word of the lord
thank you god
because you 'r e growing up so fast
lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world happy are those who are called to his supper
i 'm going to go take communion with our daughter
any interest ?
who are you ?
forget about sara collins
that UNknown l be the beginning of the end
body of christ
i can 't
they UNknown l kill us both
well i can 't help you if
there 's a group of men they UNknown e been planning this for years
they have to be stopped
give me names
UNknown UNknown cullen turner
how deep does this thing go ?
they took impressions of every tire mark and footprint within a quarter mile totally useless
all the tires were brand new and readily available
same thing with the shoes
what about the UNknown ?
none of the residents in the vicinity of that cabin saw or heard anything
best guess sara 's UNknown only came in and out at night
stone mountain 's a UNknown area
i want flyers in every UNknown UNknown climbing store
these people were off the main roads maybe they saw something
what is it ?
they need me to get a subpoena
then do it
i don 't have time to explain
UNknown UNknown cullen
pull the files on each of them
they 'r e dead politicians
why would i do that ?
because i asked you to
the press conference
he gave you these names
all five of these men were highly placed appointed or elected officials
they all died in the last 15 years
we 'r e investigating a kidnapping a homicide
you 'r e spinning out here
well every single one of these men died in plane crashes
sara wasn 't a politician
yeah but her husband is
all right ?
soon as you can
oh did we break up ?
well that depends
putting aside the possibility that you couldn 't find anywhere else to get a cold beer
i think we 'r e down to either you got dumped or or you miss me
all of the above
i 'm only in town for a couple of days
what the hell
i 'm not hungry
thank him for me would you please ?
this is judy nash and today i 'm live from capitol hill
in less than one hour the senate UNknown committee will vote on judge wallace UNknown 's nomination to the supreme court
if he is confirmed
the vote was originally scheduled for last week but has been plagued by a series of delays caused by the abduction of sara collins
given the circumstances senator collins decision to attend the vote is being described as nothing short of courageous
should the committee vote to recommend UNknown he could be confirmed by the senate majority as early as next week
this package arrived for you from UNknown
agent lucas should be with you in a moment
we got a problem graham
is that official or one ex UNknown roommate to another ?
pick your poison
you want me to make excuses
no one 's saying that you screwed up but the bureau 's gonna take a lot of heat
all right then
i mean you got to make me disappear right ?
where to ?
portland el paso
it 's not gonna be that easy
what do you want me to do ?
you 'r e giving the press conference announcing sara 's death
this is nathan miller all over again
it 's not me graham
this is way past my pay grade
truth is daniel i didn 't save her
go back to atlanta give the press conference and go home
six months paid leave
how can i help you ?
something 's come up in connection with the sara collins investigation
i was wondering if i could come and see you
well of course agent UNknown
when were you wanting to do that ?
well i can be there this afternoon
i UNknown l look forward to it
thank you so much
special agent graham UNknown
i didn 't want to pass this up the food chain in case there 's some kind of simple explanation
but we ran all the usual tests on sara 's blood from the cabin
was she getting UNknown for something ?
UNknown a bone UNknown disease ?
i don 't think so
it 's mei
just between the two of us jessica why did you come back ?
what do you want j t ?
you put on a very good show
but you 'r e flat ass broke
you haven 't been living in europe
you live in a studio apartment in UNknown
i don 't know where you get your information but
i have copies of your bank UNknown your debt collection notices
here why don 't you take a look at your credit report
it 's a train wreck
if the children find out it 's going to be pretty clear why you came back
for the money
that won 't happen again
now you 'r e still a young woman still plenty of time to move on start over
how much will it take to get you back on your feet ?
did jeffrey put you up to this ?
jeffrey trusts that i have his best interests in mind
i love my family
UNknown pick up the phone damn it
sara 's blood from the crime scene her white blood cell count was way down
but there 's nothing in her medical records to account for that
sean UNknown it further
what are you talking about ?
we assumed that it was a fatal attack because there was so much blood
but there wasn 't
they staged her death
it UNknown their purpose
it wasn 't the kidnappers
our nathan friend ?
the vote 's starting
with testimony already concluded the committee chairman senator UNknown has allowed senator collins to join the proceeding solely for the actual vote
we now take you live to the floor
without objection we will include in the record the list of letters and UNknown regarding judge UNknown
before we continue judge UNknown
i want to thank you for your patience
your professional qualifications are outstanding
your personal background is UNknown
thank you senator
our prayers are with you
and it is our sincerest hope that your wife is safely returned
excuse me excuse me excuse me excuse me
you need to sign in over there and get your visitor 's pass
radio the east corridor tell them to stop him
we have a breach at control point one
agent graham UNknown fbl
ms UNknown ?
looks like the network 's got both perimeter and internal security UNknown
this may take a minute
i don 't have a minute
come on come on come on come on
come on man
mr UNknown ?
mr collins ?
i hope you UNknown l tolerate this break in protocol
i want to thank my fellow senators for their support during this UNknown difficult time
i UNknown e known wallace UNknown for most of my life
i thought i knew wallace UNknown
but you don 't belong here wallace
and you don 't belong in the court
how dare you
ladies and gentlemen we have a possible biological threat
please evacuate the building
i have to talk to you
i have to go
agent UNknown !
i have my UNknown
you 'r e on in five four three
this is judy nash live from our studios in washington d c
less than 20 minutes ago the confirmation hearing of judge wallace UNknown was interrupted by a possible biological attack and a shooting
the morning began with political drama when senator collins publicly denounced his lifelong friend wallace UNknown
although senator collins did not formally cast his vote it is clear that he was on the verge of voting against UNknown
we have some breaking news
i UNknown e just been informed that special agent graham UNknown was pronounced dead upon his arrival at george washington hospital
for UNknown washington this is judy nash
about six years ago i was working a mail fraud case with an ex lawyer named UNknown
we got a search warrant to open a post office box
it 's no big deal
i served the warrant while UNknown popped the locks
the blast killed him before he even hit the ground
why are you telling me this ?
because i blamed myself
i needed surgery to fix it
i want you to talk to one of the UNknown incident UNknown
at least let me transfer you off the case
daddy we saw the news are you okay ?
they have to make sure the senate building wasn 't contaminated
no but they they will
tell your brother okay ?
i have to go
i think you know the answer
i 'd like to think that sara 's kidnapping has UNknown your judgment but what you said at that hearing is unforgivable
i 'm not the one who should be looking for forgiveness
i had an affair
somebody wants you on this court very badly wallace
elevator bell dings
unit chief UNknown
let me guess headquarters broke the news i was coming with their usual tact and diplomacy
that 's about right
came up through the memphis office transferred into critical incident response group
got more awards than i got socks
when a big gun like you shows up i UNknown e got to wonder why
i realize i 'm reporting to you and i don 't have a problem with that
i just want to find sara collins arrest the folks who grabbed her and be home on time to use my UNknown tickets
welcome to atlanta
but senator UNknown chairman of the UNknown committee has announced that judge UNknown 's confirmation hearing will not resume until the beginning of next week
are there any UNknown in that case ?
UNknown collins boyfriend ben wilson was UNknown this morning
just to clarify UNknown collins is senator collins daughter right ? ???
wilson 22 was the first arrest in UNknown with the abduction of sara collins
hi this is UNknown collins
i 'd like to speak to my grandfather
senator eugene collins
i know what 's in the case file
i want to know what 's not
sara collins has been missing for almost two weeks and i still don 't know why she was grabbed
all due respect agent lucas if you 'r e questioning the way graham UNknown ran this case
i 'm not
fair enough ?
i downloaded all the surveillance and media footage from the exterior of the senate office building
there 's our guy there with the cap
blow it up
hopefully it 's enough
just catch him
we don 't have access
hey UNknown it 's danny lucas
listen i 'm jammed up on this thing in atlanta
i need to search your facial recognition UNknown
no UNknown threat
UNknown asked me to do it
he said there was no time to explain
collins got his ransom demand
the kidnappers want him to confirm wallace UNknown
and you didn 't bother to share that with me ?
graham didn 't want to put you in the position of having to lie to washington
does that answer your question ?
about why sara was abducted ?
why pull her out of a ballroom full of 200 people ?
why not take one of the kids ?
they all got wives husbands families
collins isn 't the only one that can swing that vote
he 's right
neither is sara
graham made contact with a confidential UNknown
the guy that left the nathan cards ?
he asked me to order up UNknown reports
what 's that have to do with sara 's kidnapping ?
i don 't know
i UNknown l order a new set
the president would like to speak with you
he 's not happy
just put him off
i don 't know how we come back from this jeffrey
you UNknown e UNknown the entire party
well maybe i should have done that sooner
we UNknown l discuss it when i get back
we UNknown e taken the liberty of getting you another plane
tail wind so we should have you on the ground at UNknown field a little before 3 00 p m
let me know if you have any questions
romeo UNknown at the west ramp with information charlie
ready to taxi for takeoff
you 'r e clear for takeoff
thank you washington
for six months i thought the hell with him
if he 's going to let all this crap that you guys deal with turn him inside out then i don 't want that in my life
i started to think that we could make it work again
he missed you
excuse me senator ?
it 's probably just an electrical UNknown but we need to set down and make some quick repairs
i 'd better call atlanta
i already UNknown ahead to base ops
we UNknown l take care of it as quickly as possible
so good to see you grandpa
yes that 's right
i 'm still waiting to make that call to UNknown university
you 'r e a collins
anything more than a year off is UNknown
next semester i promise
now this this business with your stepmother how are you holding up ?
i 'm okay
but you do not have to make the same choice you hear me ?
i need some money from my trust fund
how much ? 20 000
you know before i was a senator i was an attorney
corporate law not criminal law
prisons are full of innocent men UNknown if you take their word for it
the fbi arrested the woman who set him up
the only reason ben is in jail is because he saw a man get shot and didn 't report it
he was scared
that 's not a particularly good quality either
i love him grandpa
i know you can do this for me
i have no intention of encouraging your romance with this ben wilson
the young man wants to prove himself worthy first thing he can do is keep himself out of jail
you don 't get it
no i do UNknown
what 's wrong ?
and he said no
i have to fix this
oh honey i understand how you feel
no you don 't
you were good together
you can 't be serious
she really loves that boy
is that such a bad thing ?
you want her to end up with a thug ?
he 's not a thug
i just want her to be happy
i almost believe you
getting close though
i 'm not sure
you can stretch your legs in the hangar
welcome to north carolina senator collins
put him in the chair
don 't leave any marks
please don 't make this difficult senator
just untie her
you didn 't
what do you want from us ?
the delays in meeting our demands have been unacceptable
say good bye senator
no more games
let me talk to her !
the fbi has identified a suspect in the murder of special agent graham UNknown
we 'r e asking for the public 's help in UNknown this man
i must UNknown that he is armed and dangerous
so if you UNknown e seen him or have knowledge of his whereabouts do not attempt to approach
contact your local law enforcement agency or fbi field office
that 's all
that 's a good question
we UNknown l let you know
could you tell us what kind of gun he used ?
ladies and gentlemen thank you again for your help
if you have any further questions there 's always a friendly face at the UNknown
oh sulking doesn 't suit you
don 't kid yourself
why is that ?
imagine my surprise when i had to find out from another reporter that you UNknown e moved to town to run the sara collins case
any comment ?
remember that ?
i just expected a phone call
don 't get up
i wasn 't looking for him
what can i do for you jessica ?
you asked me what it would take to get me out of here
well i think i was a little more subtle than that
look we UNknown e made it through two campaigns together j t so let 's not mince words
is the offer still open ?
it 's UNknown
you do like to cover your tracks don 't you ?
how much ? 20 000
you 'r e even cheaper than i thought
UNknown sent over copies of the crash reports that UNknown received yesterday
graham didn 't always keep me in the loop
all i can tell you is that he thought there was a link between the plane crashes and sara 's abduction
one kidnapping five crash reports
what 's the connection here ?
other than politics i can 't find anything
well is that not normal ?
maggie day tenth grade dumped me like a rock
hey it 's danny lucas
we just requested five crash reports and one of the fields is UNknown
did you guys happen to send us the media release copies ?
according to his computers they UNknown e been UNknown out names for over a year privacy issues
so UNknown would have received the identical ones
took it to the fbi lab in d c
i want to take a look at it myself
patch us in via UNknown
gunshot residue on the sleeve
this is definitely your shooter 's jacket
now he 's a pro
there 's no tags labels or identifying marks
any luck with hair or UNknown ?
nothing to tie him to sara collins
we did find some nylon UNknown
exhibit 1 alpha
possibly cloth UNknown
you see this pocket here ?
when i turned it inside out
i found a dead bug
tiny little guy less than a millimeter long
did you examine it yet ?
no but i UNknown e got trey UNknown standing by at UNknown
bring him up
you checked yours lately ?
warm and dark bug heaven
you got your dung beetles UNknown UNknown this one here not so common
tiny little body crazy long UNknown
can only be one thing UNknown
does that give us anything in terms of location ?
only one place in the u s coastal north carolina
cut him up
can 't wait
what did you get ?
we tied the shooter to north carolina
well if he was there maybe sara is too
none of the shooter 's UNknown have addresses in north carolina
i don 't know how far this gets us
you 'r e the shooter
you 'r e part of a well UNknown operation
you don 't want to leave a paper trail
where do you park your money ?
safety deposit boxes easy access no records
let 's run all of his UNknown against registered safety deposits in north carolina
senator collins is about to touch down
why don 't you take agent lucas to the estate ?
don 't bother
senator collins ?
i 'm taking over the investigation into your wife 's disappearance
i 'm sorry about agent UNknown
i understand sir but whoever killed
agent UNknown is probably involved in your wife 's abduction
i know you 'r e the last person to talk to him
did he say anything ?
well he said sara 's alive
you got a little blood on your neck sir
i hope you enjoyed your flight senator
is everything all right ?
everything is fine
music stops i didn 't mean to interrupt you
is that ben 's music ?
i know that
i don 't want that to happen to you
that 's why i 'm going to give you the money to bail ben out
i would have done it sooner
i just had my money tied up in these ridiculous short term bonds
mom it 's okay
just think of it as an early baby present in case i miss the shower
what are you talking about ?
well here 's the thing
i have a tiny bit of a problem
but there 's this big charity event that i 'm helping to organize in new york and i UNknown e completely dropped the ball
you 'r e leaving us for a party ?
i have to sweetie
what about us ?
max needs you
both of you
the bank records give an address ?
looks like we found our shooter
now all he 's got to do is take us to sara
you got the downloaded satellite photos ?
ready to go
we UNknown e got sniper teams covering each side right ?
you got UNknown m
first move is we 'r e going to take down this gate
UNknown 's a high risk fugitive so we go in UNknown without a surrender announcement
bravo 's going to take the front ; alpha 's going to take the back
is everyone clear ?
you see anyone with a weapon deadly force can and should be used to UNknown that individual
that 's according to headquarters
according to me there 's a good chance that UNknown might lead us to sara collins
so if you happen to tag him in the shoulder rather than going for the kill shot you 'r e not going to hear any complaints from this end
all right ?
satellite images of the UNknown reservoir ??? ???
phone ringing clear the house
clear the house
he must be watching
in pursuit of light blue cadillac
license plate number
tires squeal engine UNknown
you didn 't tell me ?
i wanted to but i was scared and i was listening to my dad and the fbi and the news
i couldn 't think straight
look UNknown you UNknown e got to give me some time
i need you now
the truth is it was easier on me
i just want to start over
you 'r e really going to have a baby ?
i have to
but your father would kill me
i UNknown l i UNknown l tell him it was my idea
pl ease mom ?
we 'r e interrupting your regular program for breaking news
meanwhile capitol hill UNknown are UNknown
senator collins outburst at judge UNknown 's confirmation hearing to a breakdown brought on by the stress of his wife 's abduction
until tomorrow this is judy nash
that 's the first time i ever saw someone slit their own throat
yeah well a few weeks ago it would have surprised me too
people are going to their grave to hide things
we may never understand
i 'm an optimist
fire UNknown are still going through UNknown 's house
what about his car ?
we 'r e ready to tow it
i want to take a look
you 'r e going to want to take a look at this
oh my god
they UNknown sara collins and i want to know why
what 's wrong ?
we wanna get paid
is that fair ?
if washington 's soldiers asked for money where would this country be today ?
but they did ask
no my friends
that might be a UNknown but i doubt it
if you UNknown l all stick with me and work hard we UNknown l forget about money
let 's get together and make a regular hotel of this place
i UNknown l put writing paper in the hotel
and next year if you behave i UNknown l put in envelopes
i UNknown l put extra blankets free in all your rooms
there UNknown l be no cover charge
three years ago i came to florida without a nickel
now i UNknown e got a nickel
that 's all very well mr hammer
but we haven 't been paid in two weeks and we want our wages
answer me that
remember there 's nothing like liberty except UNknown and the saturday evening post
be free my friends
there you are
now if you boys will only be calm
we arrive this afternoon on the 4 30
kindly reserve two floors and three ceilings
must be mice
western union and they UNknown e got a lot of money too
on the 4 15 ?
well i UNknown l take the bus down myself
this hotel will be so crowded that we UNknown l be turning away thousands of people
if there is another hotel in cocoanut beach cancel our reservations
i knew it
can you come to the wedding ?
you see everything is all right boys
you 'r e all invited to the wedding of aunt fanny 's 8 pound boy
in the meantime i want you to buck up get down to work
let 's put this thing over with a bang
and above all forget about money
don 't think of it because you won 't get it anyway
UNknown cheering merrily
UNknown i 'm going down to meet the 4 15
if i never come back i UNknown l be still waiting for the train
in my absence i 'm relying on you to handle everything
you can depend upon me sir
that 's fine
and think of me
all right sir
i 'm not worried about a hotel clerk
no but i UNknown l bet you 'r e worried about the potter millions
you generally could use money in the old days
lay off that stuff
i can take care of myself
i doubt it
what do you mean ?
have you ever seen that diamond necklace of mrs potter 's ?
you bet i have
her room and my room are right next to each other
hers is 318
the key is always in her bag
that 's what you UNknown e got to get
it 's a large order but maybe it can be done
suppose i invite mrs potter and polly to take supper with me tonight ?
what then ?
now you 'r e talking
that sounds more like old times
now i UNknown l try and get rid of bob adams for you
romantic instrumental music
what a question
true but that 's why there hasn 't been any development here
couldn 't it be cut down ?
UNknown practically built palm beach and miami but he said he wouldn 't touch this
when a man like that passes a place up no one wants it
do you know anything about architecture ?
no but i 'd love to learn
i made a drawing of the whole place showing the hills as a built up scheme without cutting down the hill or having it get in the way
i made the hill fit in with the UNknown scheme
i sent UNknown a copy last week
his secretary wrote me saying they were studying my plans
that 's thrilling
if he only does i 'm sure it will be the most beautiful place in the world
it would be if you lived there
look see what i UNknown e written ?
heaven for polly and me
that looks great
any day now
let 's make it come true
when my dreams come true
and i UNknown l be smiling through
when my dreams come true
that spanish castle i built in my mind
will be a love nest of the practical kind
and i UNknown l be there with you
when my dreams come true
ever since i met you
all that i seem to do is dream
when will i realise my dreams ?
when my dreams come true
and i UNknown l be smiling through
when my dreams come true
that spanish castle i built in my mind
will be a love nest of the practical kind
and i UNknown l be there with you
i am looking
let 's find out
she generally is and she generally finds me
you know mother
i 'd like to hear the rest of it sometime
well miracles do happen
but only for a little while mother
why a daughter of mine should fool around with a hotel clerk when she has the opportunity of marrying one of the boston yates
is more than i can understand
who cares about the boston yates ?
anyway bob isn 't a clerk
he 's an architect
one who clerks is a clerk and that settles it
and i want you to remember that no potter has ever been involved in a single scandal
how about uncle dick ?
it 's a well known fact that your uncle was drunk at the time
you ought to stop drinking so much coffee
i 'm sorry sir
yes it didn 't hit me
that 's the only luck i had
i think i know what 's wrong with the hotel
i know too
maybe the hotel hasn 't opened yet
don 't worry
and making the beds
how do you do ?
why don 't you whistle at the crossing ?
you 'r e just the woman i 'm looking for
i 'm gonna tell you about florida real estate
first time it 's ever been mentioned down here
i 'm sorry but
this is the biggest development since sophie tucker
florida is the show spot of america and cocoanut beach is the black spot of florida ?
you told me about this yesterday
but i left out a comma
soon we 'r e holding an auction at cocoanut manor the suburb terrible beautiful
you must come
if you don 't like UNknown we can play contract
here it is
1 600 miles as the crow flies 1 800 as the UNknown
cocoanut manor UNknown the american sewer and the florida sucker
it 's the most exclusive residential district in florida
nobody lives there
our motto is cocoanut beach no snow no ice and no business
florida is the greatest state in the union
is it ?
take all the alligator pears and keep them
see if i care
i haven 't the least idea
because you UNknown e never been an alligator and don 't let it happen again
it sometimes requires years to bring the pear and alligator together
they don 't like each other
i don 't think so
all they can get a hold of
florida feeds the nation but nobody feeds me
that 's what i want to discuss with you
also take our cattle raising
i don 't mean anything personal
but here is the ideal cattle raising section
we have UNknown UNknown and UNknown
will you let me say something please ?
i don 't think so
there 's something else i wanna tell you
where will you be when you 'r e 65 ?
that 's about three months from now
if i were to buy i should prefer some place like palm beach
palm beach ?
the slums of tomorrow ?
you know the population of cocoanut beach doubled last week ?
has it ?
sorry i 'm afraid i must be going
nobody can fool a woman like you on a sewer pipe can they ?
this is the 8 inch pipe
all property owners will be allowed to vote on the size
in case of a tie it goes to the supreme court
i can give you a little inside information in advance
here put it in your pocket
see you later
i don 't want it
is that so ?
you want some ?
no i haven 't
get some onions
in a nice quiet spot
a nice quiet spot ?
tell her she can eat in the lobby
we ought to dress this place up a bit
it looks terrible
i haven 't seen them
i 'm gonna fire some of them
give me the firing bell
stick around here
look at him
come over here
explain your business
how do you do ?
how are you ?
what do you want ?
i see you 'r e here for the winter
step this way
okay we stay for the summer too
sorry we haven 't got any vacancies
you want a room ?
we UNknown l fill it up before we leave
you UNknown l empty it before i go out
step this way boys
anybody else ?
a suite on the third floor ?
i UNknown l take a polack in the basement
you UNknown l have to take that up with the UNknown department
that 's an entirely different proposition and i can 't
i can use you the first of the month
what do you want ?
do you want a single room ?
we 'd like to double up
eat some green apples
i can 't hear you
if you UNknown l take your nose out of the receiver it UNknown l be okay
you wanna know where you can get a hold of mrs potter ?
i don 't know
they 'r e UNknown
i don 't want you to get any of the worst ones
i 'm so glad
i have some very important business to attend to
i 'm going upstairs to get your partner a stomach pump
i UNknown l be down in a few minutes
and while i 'm gone don 't forget
all right goodbye
harpo rings bell
well i told her that i trusted her
you trusted her ?
i could kill those tramps
wait a minute
i UNknown e got an idea
about them ?
why not them ?
but have you got anything definite ?
suppose i flirt with them and they come to my room
then what ?
then the night the necklace disappeared they were seen near mrs potter 's
get it ?
that 's a grand idea
thanks kind sir
see you later
all the time you eat
that 's no good
right now i 'd do anything for money
i 'd kill someone for it
i 'd kill you for money
i kill you for nothing
why do you laugh ?
you 'r e here for three hours and you no got something yet
what do you got ?
a beautiful watch
i give up
i brought some pictures from headquarters
let me see your face
why you push ?
what are you guys fighting for ?
no that 's my friend
we play this way
what 's your name ?
i 'm pretty suspicious of you birds
now you listen to me
i haven 't got anything on you yet but i 'm going to keep watching
i UNknown e got your full records right here in my pocket
there 's enough to send you up the minute you start anything
you get me ?
you can 't wait a little bit
what do you got ?
you 'r e a detective
hurry along my dear
can you tell me what time is the next train to philadelphia ?

that 's fine
that 's a good iooking coat you have on

penelope giggles UNknown
that 's funny
tell me do you know who i am ?
do you know my room number ?
i UNknown l be there at 11 00 tonight
playing a slow tune
not the present prince of wales
one of the old wales
and believe me when i say wales i mean wales
i know a whale when i see one
did you say your room was 318 ?
i 'm the proprietor of this hotel and i have a passkey to every room in it
you know they passkey down the UNknown
won 't you lie down ?
if we could find a little bungalow
of course i know we could find one but maybe the people wouldn 't get out
if we could find a nice little empty bungalow just for me and you where we could bill and cow
no where we could bull and cow
do you know what you 'r e trying to say ?
yes it 's not what i 'm thinking of
what i meant was if we had a nice little bungalow and you were inside and i was outside trying to get in or inside trying to get out
no i was in
i don 't think i understand
i mean your eyes they shine like the pants of a blue serge suit
that 's on the pants
what i meant was if we had a nice bungalow
i came home from work and you were standing by the gate
no you came home from work and i was standing by the gate
that 's more like it
and we came down the path and we went inside
and the shades were drawn and the lights were low and
are you sure your husband 's dead ?
a yes like that was once responsible for me jumping out of a window
and i 'm not the jumper i used to be
what i meant was you 'r e gonna be here all winter and i 'm stuck with the hotel anyhow
why don 't you grab me until you can make other arrangements ?
my dear mr hammer i shall never get married before my daughter
you did once
what in the world is the matter with you ?
i 'm not myself tonight
i don 't know who i am
one false move and i 'm yours
i love you
i might but i 'd keep my mouth shut
don 't go and leave me alone
you stay and i UNknown l go away
i don 't know what to say
say that you UNknown l be truly mine or truly yours or yours truly
come on i UNknown l play you one more game
just think tonight when the moon is sneaking around the clouds i UNknown l be sneaking around you
i UNknown l meet you tonight under the moon
i can see you now you and the moon
wear a necktie so i UNknown l know you
playing soothing music
that 's right
that 's fine
how do you mean ?
there UNknown l be trouble when she misses it
well we can 't have it found on us
i should say not
hide it ?
but where ?
a hollow tree stump a mile from here
will that do ?
i 'm not so sure harvey
here i UNknown l show you
you go right down cocoanut road
then there 's UNknown road like this
instead you take the granada road
suddenly you come to a clearing with a fringe of trees around it
that 's cocoanut manor where the stump is
it 's about 20 feet from the edge of the clearing
that 's where you put the jewels
you can 't miss it
you take the necklace out there see ?
i UNknown e got to go back downstairs or mrs potter will be suspicious
and be careful
everything 's going along UNknown now
you remember me the prince of wales ?
of course i do
if there 's gonna be two people in this room it UNknown l be 50 cents extra
did he go ?
you remember me the prince of wales ?
who is it ?
knocking on door
mr hammer what are you doing in my room ?
thank goodness he 's gone
never mind operator
i guess there 's nobody in here
you don 't know where to look
what 's that you said ?
this is awful
everything seems to be all right in here
knocking on door
sighs in relief
you UNknown l have to keep him in a trap in your room
i can 't catch him
who is he ?
that 's your silent partner ?
you wired me about some property
i UNknown e thought it over
i can let you have three lots watering the front or three lots UNknown the water
these lots cost me 9 000
i UNknown l let you have them for 15 000 because i like you

i 'm taking all the blame myself
i was joking and you took me seriously
when you told me you 'd taken it i just couldn 't believe it
told you i 'd taken what ?
why polly she 's out of her mind
it sounds quite plausible to me
i begged him to take it back
say i 'm not gonna stand for any more of this
why the whole thing is ridiculous
it 's absurd
i don 't care what you think any of you
polly you know it 's a lie don 't you ?

ladies and gentlemen mr hammer will now act as master of ceremonies
on behalf of the UNknown club of UNknown
i want to take this occasion of welcoming you to UNknown
no i mean in recognition of my many years of service with the railroad you have presented me with these ties
and that of course reminds me of the story of the irishman
oft in the UNknown night the trembling of a leaf can be heard
sighing through the trees and the babbling brook
as it UNknown its way onward babbling and
well i got rid of one
and one like that is worth three ordinary ones
where was i ?
UNknown and spring veal showed a firm tone
and eggs were a little touchy on a falling market
my mother and father talked it over and they finally moved to new york
they took a little house in the bronx and it was in that house that abraham lincoln was born quite to my father 's surprise
and that boys and girls was the beginning of the lincoln highway
friends in view of the fact that miss polly 's engagement is being celebrated here tonight
i think a few words from her mother would be revolting
i now take great pleasure in presenting to you the well preserved and partially pickled mrs potter
come on now give the little girl a big hand
speech big speech
as i look into your faces they 'r e all lit with gay laughter
the whole world and everything in it is bathed in a soft flowing luminous haze
the old gal is stewed to the eyebrows
and now i want to wish you all a most enjoyable evening
as for myself i 'm sad
i simply can 't go any further
i UNknown l get off with you
now friends i want to take great pleasure in presenting to you the groom mr yates
mr harvey yates
stand by for your station announcer
my dear dear friends
well shut up
you must call on me sometime
i was just about to
come up and see my flower beds
what i intended to say
i 'd like you to see my UNknown
the short UNknown and long UNknown
i was just going to say
next spring i UNknown l get some early UNknown
as i was about to say
there seems to be a steady stream flowing in and out over there
i wouldn 't dream of taking up any more of your time
i really wanted to thank you all and as i said before
i hadn 't intended to make a speech at all
but you certainly succeeded
mrs potter muttering UNknown
mr hammer can 't you do something ?
they 'r e doing plenty
now ladies and gentlemen the first musical number that we intend to UNknown will be the beginning and ending of a very
we 'r e gonna have music
the first musical number on the programme will be a piccolo solo which we will skip
the second number will be se or pastrami the UNknown pianist
se or for his first selection will play a cup of coffee a sandwich and you from the opera aida
se or allow me to escort you to the UNknown
se or pastrami what is the first number ?
down in front
i know i have the sincere wishes of all my friends
i can only tell you how much i appreciate it
i think i can honestly say this is the happiest moment of my life
look what i have here
it 's a little engagement present just given me by mr yates
he wrote it just now
but he wrote another yesterday when a necklace was stolen
they are both in his handwriting
let me read it to you
it shows how to get to cocoanut manor and the hollow tree stump and reads hollow stump jewels
it 's a good thing it was my personal check
tell him i UNknown e got one
i think you will want to see him
his name is mr john w UNknown
he has accepted my UNknown plans for the development of cocoanut manor
he also wants to know if you can accommodate 400 guests for the weekend
what is it ?
mr adams how can you ever forgive me ?
please mrs potter
the wedding will take place exactly as planned
that is with the exception of a slight change
she will be married to mr robert adams
when my dreams come true
and i UNknown l be smiling through
when my dreams come true
that spanish castle
will be our love nest
the practical kind
when my dreams
what 's the matter ?
somebody pay their bill ?
we wanna get paid
is that fair ?
suppose george washington 's soldiers had asked for money ?
where would this country be today ?
but they did ask
no my friends
that might be a UNknown but i doubt it
if you UNknown l all stick with me and work hard we UNknown l forget about money
let 's get together and we UNknown l make a regular hotel out of this place
i UNknown l put writing paper in the hotel and next year if you behave yourselves i UNknown l put in envelopes
i 'm gonna put extra blankets free in all your rooms
there UNknown l be no cover charge
three years ago i came to florida without a nickel in my pocket
and now i UNknown e got a nickel in my pocket
that 's all very well mr hammer but we haven 't been paid in two weeks and we want our wages
answer me that
remember there 's nothing like liberty except and the
be free my friends
there you are
now if you UNknown boys will only be calm
uh huh we arrive this afternoon on the 4 30
kindly reserve two floors and three ceilings
they must be mice
see that things have started our way already
who 's it from ?
western union and they UNknown e got a lot of money too
on the 4 15 eh ?
well i UNknown l take the bus down myself
here 's another one mr hammer
see we 'r e gonna be stuffed by tonight
this hotel will be so crowded that we UNknown l be turning away thousands of people
if there is another hotel in cocoanut beach cancel our reservations
i knew it
aunt fanny had an eight pound boy
can you come to the wedding ?
you see everything is all right boys
everything is all right
in the meantime i want you to buck up get down to work
let 's put this thing over with a bang
and above all forget about money
don 't think of it
just forget about it because you won 't get it anyway
UNknown i 'm going down to meet the 4 15
if i never come back you UNknown l know i 'm still waiting for the train
you can depend upon me sir
that 's fine
and think of me UNknown
you bet i will
all right sir
i 'm not worried about a hotel clerk
no but i UNknown l bet you 'r e worried about the potter millions
you generally could use money in the old days
oh lay off that stuff
you know marrying polly is the only way for you to square your debts
i can take care of myself
i doubt it
what do you mean ?
have you ever seen that diamond necklace of mrs potter 's ?
you bet i have
her room and my room are right next to each other
hers is 318 ; mine 320
the door between is unlocked
the key is always in her bag
that 's what you UNknown e got to get
it 's a large order but maybe it can be done
suppose i invite mrs potter and polly to take supper with me tonight ?
what then ?
now you 'r e talking
that sounds more like old times
and now i will try and get rid of bob adams for you
look this is cocoanut manor
you know that hill ?
what a question
it 's cunning all right
but that 's why there hasn 't been any development here
couldn 't it be cut down ?
john w UNknown was here to see it last month
you know UNknown practically built palm beach and miami but he said he wouldn 't touch this
now when a man like that passes a place up no one wants it
do you know anything about architecture ?
no but i 'd love to learn
well i made a drawing of the whole place showing the hills
it 's a built up scheme without cutting down the hill or having it get in the way
i made the hill fit in with the UNknown scheme
i sent UNknown a copy last week and his secretary wrote me a nice note saying they were studying my plans
that 's thrilling
say i may be an architect yet
if he only does i 'm sure it will be the most beautiful place in the world
it would be if you lived there
look see what i UNknown e written ?
heaven for polly and me
that looks great
any day now
let 's make it come true
will be a love nest
the practical kind
all that i seem to do
when will i realize
will be a love nest
the practical kind
i am looking
i wonder who it can be
let 's find out
she generally is and she generally finds me
you know mother
i 'd like to hear the rest of it sometime
well miracles do happen
but only for a little while mother
why a daughter of mine should fool around with a hotel clerk when she has the opportunity of marrying one of the boston yates is more than i can understand
oh who cares about the boston yates ?
anyway bob isn 't a clerk
he 's an architect
one who clerks polly is a clerk and that settles it
and i want you to remember that no potter has ever been involved in a single scandal
how about uncle dick ?
polly it 's a well known fact that your uncle was drunk at the time
you ought to cut out drinking so much coffee
i 'm sorry sir
yes it didn 't hit me
that 's the only luck i had with it
mr hammer i think i know what 's wrong with the hotel
i think i know too
you 'r e fired
maybe the season hasn 't started yet
maybe the hotel hasn 't opened yet
don 't worry mr hammer
in a few weeks you UNknown l be cleaning up
yes and making the beds
go on get out of here
i can handle this rush myself
600 rooms in the hotel and you have to sleep here
how do you do mr hammer ?
why don 't you whistle at the crossing ?
you 'r e just the woman i 'm looking for
now whether you like it or not i 'm gonna tell you about florida real estate
it 's the first time it 's ever been mentioned down here today
i 'm sorry but
do you know that this is the biggest development since sophie tucker ?
do you know that florida is the show spot of america and cocoanut beach is the black spot of florida ?
you told me about this yesterday
i know but i left out a comma
you must come over
if you don 't like UNknown we can play contract
here it is
1 600 miles as the crow flies 1 800 as the UNknown
there you are cocoanut manor UNknown the american sewer and the florida sucker
why it 's the most exclusive residential district in florida
nobody lives there
our motto is cocoanut beach no snow no ice and no business
do you know that florida is the greatest state in the union ?
is it ?
take all the alligator pears and keep UNknown m
see if i care
haven 't the slightest idea
that 's because you UNknown e never been an alligator and don 't let it happen again
do you know that it sometimes requires years to bring the pear and the alligator together ?
they don 't like each other
i don 't think i do
all they can get a hold of
florida feeds the nation but nobody feeds me and that 's what i wanna talk to you about
i don 't mean anything personal
but here is the ideal cattle raising section
we have UNknown UNknown and UNknown
mr hammer will you let me say something please ?
i hardly think so and there 's something else i wanna bring to your mind
where will you be when you 'r e 65 ?
that 's only about three months from now
if i were to buy i should prefer someplace like palm beach
palm beach ?
the slums of tomorrow ?
do you know that the population of cocoanut beach has doubled in the past week ?
has it ?
i 'm sorry but i 'm afraid i must be going
aw now don 't go
before you go let me show you a sample of our sewer pipe we 'r e gonna lay
look at it
now this is the eight inch pipe
but of course all property owners will be allowed to vote on the size of their pipe
in case of a tie it goes to the supreme court and i can give you a little inside information in advance
the chief justice is crazy about this type of sewer
here put it in your pocket
i UNknown l see you later
mr hammer i can 't use this
i don 't want it
is that so ?
oh you want some ?
oh that 's different
no i haven 't
get some onions
a nice quiet spot ?
we ought to dress this place up a bit
it looks terrible
UNknown what 's become of our front ?
are we all out of front ?
i haven 't seen UNknown m
i 'm gonna fire some of those people
give me the fire bell
why don 't you stick around here
if anybody comes in that looks like a customer tie UNknown m and brand UNknown m
are you boys giving me the runaround ?
come over here
explain your business
oh you 'r e the boys that sent the telegram ?
how do you do ?
that 's a coincidence
how are you ?
now what do you want ?
explain your business
oh i see
well step this way and i UNknown l see what i can do for you
i 'm sorry boys but we haven 't got any vacancies

bells ringing rapidly
well you see i told her that i trusted her
you trusted her ?
i could kill those tramps
wait a minute
i UNknown e got an idea
about them ?
why not them ?
but have you got anything definite ?
suppose i flirt with them and they come to my room
then what ?
then on the night the necklace disappeared they were seen near mrs potter 's

that 's a grand idea
thanks kind sir

i 'd kill somebody for money
i 'd kill you for money
oh no you 'r e my friend

maybe you got a good idea eh ?
well don 't you dare come to room 320 at 11 00
all right i come half past 10 00
when my dreams come true
did you see a handkerchief ?
i thought i dropped one
well it really doesn 't matter because what i 'm really interested in is you
did anyone ever tell you that you looked like the prince of wales ?
that 's funny
tell me do you know who i am ?
do you know my room number ?
well i UNknown l be there at 11 00 tonight
i don 't mean the present prince of wales
one of the old wales
and believe me when i say wales i mean wales
i know a whale when i see one
did you say your room was 318 ?
i 'm the proprietor of this hotel and i have a passkey to every room in it
you know they passkey down the UNknown
won 't you uh lie down ?
aw if we could find a little bungalow eh ?
of course i know we could find one but maybe the people wouldn 't get out
but if we could find a nice little empty bungalow just for me and you where we could bill and cow
no where we could bull and cow
do you know what you 'r e trying to say ?
yes it 's not what i 'm thinking of
what i meant was if we had a nice little bungalow and you was inside and i was outside trying to get in or inside trying to get out
no i was in
i don 't think i understand
i mean your eyes your eyes they shine like the pants of a blue serge suit
that 's on the pants
what i meant was if we had a nice bungalow and i came home from work and you were standing by the gate
no you came home from work and i was standing by the gate
that 's more like it
and we came down the path and we went inside and the shades were drawn and the lights were low and uh then uh
are you sure your husband 's dead ?
you know a yes like that was once responsible for me jumping out of a window
and i 'm not the jumper i used to be
you did once
i love you
what in the world is the matter with you ?
oh i 'm not myself tonight
i don 't know who i am
one false move and i 'm yours
i love you
i might but i 'd keep my mouth shut
i UNknown l not stay here any longer and be insulted this way
no don 't go away and leave me here alone
you stay here and i UNknown l go away
i don 't know what to say
say that you UNknown l be truly mine or truly yours or yours truly
don 't you know that i 'm
will you keep your hands to yourself !
just think tonight tonight when the moon is sneaking around the clouds i UNknown l be sneaking around you
i UNknown l meet you tonight under the moon
oh i can see you now you and the moon
you wear a necktie so i UNknown l know you
when my dreams come true
send up some ice water right away
that 's right
oh that 's fine
how do you mean ?
there 's bound to be trouble when she misses the necklace
i should say not
hide it ?
yes but where ?
a hollow tree stump about a mile from here
will that do ?
it 's cocoanut manor
i 'm not so sure harvey
here i UNknown l show you
now you you go right out cocoanut road
then there 's UNknown road like this but instead you take the granada road
suddenly you come to a clearing with a fringe of trees around it
that 's cocoanut manor where the stump is
it 's about 20 feet from the edge of the clearing
that 's where you put the jewels
you can 't miss it
now you take the necklace right out there see ?
i UNknown e got to go back downstairs or mrs potter will be suspicious
and be careful
everything 's going along UNknown now
do you remember me ?
the prince of wales ?
why yes of course i do
mr hammer how dare you come into my room ?
do you remember me ?
prince of wales ?
mr hammer what are you doing in my room ?
i UNknown l find out about this outfit
well i guess there 's nobody in here
you don 't know where to look
what 's that you said ?
oh this is awful
well everything seems to be all right in here
i 'm not so sure about that
alone at last
if you wanna keep him up in the room you UNknown l have to keep him in a trap
i can 't catch him
who is he ?
oh that 's your silent partner
well anyhow you wired me about some property
i UNknown e thought it over
now i can let you have three lots watering the front or i can let you have three lots UNknown the water
now these lots cost me 9 000 and i 'm gonna let you have them for 15 because i like you
i no buy nothing
i no got a one cent
how are you gonna pay for your room ?
that 's your lookout
well you see we come here to make money
i read in the paper and it say big boom in florida
so we come
i UNknown l show you how you can make some real money
i 'm going to hold an auction in a little while in cocoanut manor
you know what an auction is eh ?
i come from italy on the

i UNknown l find time for both
well maybe we can cut out the auction
here 's what i mean
if somebody says 100 you say two
if somebody says two you say three
how am i gonna know when they no say nothin ?
well they UNknown l probably notify you
you fool if they don 't say anything you UNknown l hear UNknown m won 't you ?
well maybe i no listen
well don 't tell UNknown m
now then if we 'r e successful in disposing of these lots i UNknown l see that you get a nice commission
and how about some money ?
well you can have your choice
now in arranging these lots of course we use blueprints
you know what a blueprint is huh ?
it 's oysters
i go around by myself
yeah it 's too much
i don 't mean a whole lot
just a little lot with nothing on it
anytime you got a too much you got a whole lot
look i explain it to you
sometimes you no got a enough
sometimes you got a whole lot
sometimes you got a little bit
you no think it 's enough
somebody else maybe think it 's a too much
it 's a whole lot too
now a whole lot is a too much too much is a whole lot

i had no idea he 'd think that i meant it
i didn 't want you to do it
i just meant that you could give me one like it
wait a minute
i 'm taking all the blame myself
i was joking and you took me seriously
bob last night when you told me that you 'd taken it i just couldn 't believe it
told you i 'd taken what ?
why polly she 's out of her mind
it sounds quite plausible to me
i begged him to take it back
say i 'm not gonna stand for any more of this
why the whole thing is ridiculous
it 's absurd !
polly you know it 's a lie don 't you ?
it was just a harmless UNknown and then well he lost his head

of course i do
mr adams i must ask you never to speak to my daughter again

eat eat eat
i want to take this occasion of welcoming you to UNknown
no no i mean in recognition of my many years of service with the railroad you have presented me with these ties
and that of course reminds me of the story of the irishman
oft in the UNknown night the trembling of a leaf can be heard sighing through the trees
and the babbling brook as it UNknown its way onward babbling and
well i got rid of one
and one like that is worth three ordinary ones
where was i ?
that 's right
UNknown and spring veal showed a firm tone
and eggs were a little touchy on a falling market
well my mother and father talked it over and they finally moved to new york
they took a little house in the bronx
and it was in that little house that abraham lincoln was born much to my father 's surprise
and that boys and girls was the beginning of the lincoln highway
and now friends in view of the fact that miss potter 's engagement is being celebrated here tonight so to speak
i think a few words from her mother would be revolting
i now take great pleasure in presenting to you the well preserved and partially pickled mrs potter
come on now
the old gal is stewed to the eyebrows
and now i want to wish you all a most enjoyable evening
as for myself i 'm sad
i simply can 't go any farther
i UNknown l get off with you
now friends i want to take great pleasure in presenting to you the groom mr yates mr harvey yates
good evening radio fans
stand by for your station announcer
my dear dear friends
well shut up
nevertheless mr hammer it was very nice of you to call on me
you must call on me sometime
i was just about to
yes come up and see my flower bed
what i intended to say
i want you to see my UNknown
i was just going to say that
next spring i 'm gonna get some early UNknown
as i was about to say
there seems to be a steady stream flowing in and out over there
i wouldn 't dream of taking up any more of your time
i really wanted to thank you all
well you certainly succeeded
that 's that good gulf gas
don 't do that
i don 't have to
they 'r e doing plenty
we 'r e gonna have music
now the first musical number on the program will be a piccolo solo which we will skip
and the second number will be senor pastrami the UNknown pianist
the senor for his first selection will play a cup of coffee a sandwich and you from the opera
senor allow me to escort you to the diet
uh senor pastrami what is the first number ?
down in front
the little lady who is to become mrs harvey yates over my dead body
i know i have the sincere wishes of all my friends and can only tell you how much i appreciate it
i think i can honestly say this is the happiest moment of my life
look what i have here
it 's a little engagement present just given me by mr yates
he wrote it just now but he wrote another yesterday when a necklace was stolen
they are both in his handwriting
let me read it to you
it shows how to get to cocoanut manor and the hollow tree stump and reads hollow stump jewels
i don 't believe it
see for yourself
it 's a good thing it was my personal check
tell him i UNknown e got one
well i think you will want to see him
his name is mr john w UNknown
he has accepted my UNknown plans for the development of cocoanut manor
well happy days old boy
400 guests ?
mother you must admit you were mistaken
mr adams how can you ever forgive me ?
oh please mrs potter
the wedding will take place exactly as planned
that is with the exception of a slight change
she will be married to mr robert adams
what 's the matter ?
somebody pay their bill ?
we want our money
we wanna get paid
is that fair ?
suppose george washington 's soldiers had asked for money ?
where would this country be today ?
but they did ask
no my friends
that might be a UNknown but i doubt it
we want our money
if you UNknown l all stick with me and work hard we UNknown l forget about money
let 's get together and we UNknown l make a regular hotel out of this place
i UNknown l put writing paper in the hotel and next year if you behave yourselves i UNknown l put in envelopes
i 'm gonna put extra blankets free in all your rooms
there UNknown l be no cover charge
think of the opportunities here in florida
three years ago i came to florida without a nickel in my pocket
and now i UNknown e got a nickel in my pocket
that 's all very well mr hammer but we haven 't been paid in two weeks and we want our wages
answer me that
there you are
now if you UNknown boys will only be calm
uh huh we arrive this afternoon on the 4 30
kindly reserve two floors and three ceilings they must be mice
if we like your property we will immediately buy it
see that things have started our way already
who 's it from ?
western union and they UNknown e got a lot of money too
on the 4 15 eh ?
well i UNknown l take the bus down myself
here 's another one mr hammer
see we 'r e gonna be stuffed by tonight
this hotel will be so crowded that we UNknown l be turning away thousands of people
if there is another hotel in cocoanut beach cancel our reservations
i knew it
aunt fanny had an eight pound boy
can you come to the wedding ?
you see everything is all right boys
everything is all right
in the meantime i want you to buck up get down to work
let 's put this thing over with a bang
and above all forget about money
don 't think of it
just forget about it because you won 't get it anyway
UNknown i 'm going down to meet the 4 15
if i never come back you UNknown l know i 'm still waiting for the train
you can depend upon me sir
that 's fine
and think of me UNknown
you bet i will
all right sir
i 'm not worried about a hotel clerk
no but i UNknown l bet you 'r e worried about the potter millions
you generally could use money in the old days
oh lay off that stuff
you know marrying polly is the only way for you to square your debts
i can take care of myself
i doubt it
what do you mean ?
have you ever seen that diamond necklace of mrs potter 's ?
you bet i have
her room and my room are right next to each other
hers is 318 ; mine 320
the door between is unlocked
the key is always in her bag
that 's what you UNknown e got to get
it 's a large order but maybe it can be done
suppose i invite mrs potter and polly to take supper with me tonight ?
what then ?
now you 'r e talking
that sounds more like old times
and now i will try and get rid of bob adams for you
look this is cocoanut manor
you know that hill ?
what a question
it 's cunning all right
but that 's why there hasn 't been any development here
couldn 't it be cut down ?
john w UNknown was here to see it last month
you know UNknown practically built palm beach and miami but he said he wouldn 't touch this
now when a man like that passes a place up no one wants it
do you know anything about architecture ?
no but i 'd love to learn
well i made a drawing of the whole place showing the hills
it 's a built up scheme without cutting down the hill or having it get in the way
i made the hill fit in with the UNknown scheme
i sent UNknown a copy last week and his secretary wrote me a nice note saying they were studying my plans
that 's thrilling
say i may be an architect yet
if he only does i 'm sure it will be the most beautiful place in the world
it would be if you lived there
look see what i UNknown e written ?
heaven for polly and me
that looks great
any day now
let 's make it come true
will be a love nest
the practical kind
all that i seem to do
when will i realize
will be a love nest
the practical kind
i am looking
i wonder who it can be
let 's find out
she generally is and she generally finds me
you know mother
i 'd like to hear the rest of it sometime
well miracles do happen
but only for a little while mother
why a daughter of mine should fool around with a hotel clerk when she has the opportunity of marrying one of the boston yates is more than i can understand
oh who cares about the boston yates ?
anyway bob isn 't a clerk
he 's an architect
one who clerks polly is a clerk and that settles it
and i want you to remember that no potter has ever been involved in a single scandal
how about uncle dick ?
polly it 's a well known fact that your uncle was drunk at the time
you ought to cut out drinking so much coffee
i 'm sorry sir
yes it didn 't hit me
that 's the only luck i had with it
mr hammer i think i know what 's wrong with the hotel
i think i know too
you 'r e fired
maybe the season hasn 't started yet
maybe the hotel hasn 't opened yet
don 't worry mr hammer
in a few weeks you UNknown l be cleaning up
yes and making the beds
go on get out of here
i can handle this rush myself
600 rooms in the hotel and you have to sleep here
how do you do mr hammer ?
why don 't you whistle at the crossing ?
you 'r e just the woman i 'm looking for
now whether you like it or not i 'm gonna tell you about florida real estate
it 's the first time it 's ever been mentioned down here today
i 'm sorry but
do you know that this is the biggest development since sophie tucker ?
do you know that florida is the show spot of america and cocoanut beach is the black spot of florida ?
you told me about this yesterday
i know but i left out a comma
you must come over
if you don 't like UNknown we can play contract
here it is
1 600 miles as the crow flies 1 800 as the UNknown
there you are cocoanut manor UNknown the american sewer and the florida sucker
why it 's the most exclusive residential district in florida
nobody lives there
our motto is cocoanut beach no snow no ice and no business
do you know that florida is the greatest state in the union ?
is it ?
take all the alligator pears and keep UNknown m
see if i care
haven 't the slightest idea
that 's because you UNknown e never been an alligator and don 't let it happen again
do you know that it sometimes requires years to bring the pear and the alligator together ?
they don 't like each other
i don 't think i do
all they can get a hold of
florida feeds the nation but nobody feeds me and that 's what i wanna talk to you about
i don 't mean anything personal
but here is the ideal cattle raising section
we have UNknown UNknown and UNknown
mr hammer will you let me say something please ?
i hardly think so and there 's something else i wanna bring to your mind
where will you be when you 'r e 65 ?
that 's only about three months from now
if i were to buy i should prefer someplace like palm beach
palm beach ?
the slums of tomorrow ?
do you know that the population of cocoanut beach has doubled in the past week ?
has it ?
i 'm sorry but i 'm afraid i must be going
aw now don 't go
before you go let me show you a sample of our sewer pipe we 'r e gonna lay
look at it
now this is the eight inch pipe
but of course all property owners will be allowed to vote on the size of their pipe
in case of a tie it goes to the supreme court and i can give you a little inside information in advance
the chief justice is crazy about this type of sewer
here put it in your pocket
i UNknown l see you later
mr hammer i can 't use this
i don 't want it
is that so ?
oh you want some ?
oh that 's different
no i haven 't
get some onions
a nice quiet spot ?
we ought to dress this place up a bit
it looks terrible
UNknown what 's become of our front ?
are we all out of front ?
i haven 't seen UNknown m
i 'm gonna fire some of those people
give me the fire bell
why don 't you stick around here
if anybody comes in that looks like a customer tie UNknown m and brand UNknown m
hey come on
come over here
explain your business
oh you 'r e the boys that sent the telegram ?
how do you do ?
that 's a coincidence
how are you ?
that 's all right
now what do you want ?
explain your business
oh i see
well step this way and i UNknown l see what i can do for you
i 'm sorry boys but we haven 't got any vacancies
you want a room ?
that 's all right
oh you will eh ?
well you UNknown l empty it before i go out
step this way boys

all right all right
would you like a suite on the third floor ?
no i UNknown l take a polack in the basement
i 'm sorry

now then what do you want ?
what do you want ?
do you want a single room ?
we 'd like to double up
well eat some green apples

they 'r e UNknown
i don 't want you to get any of the worst ones
there you are
i have some very important business to attend to
as a matter of fact i 'm going upstairs to get your partner a stomach pump
he needs one
and while i 'm gone don 't forget
we got a nothing
we got a nothing
all right good bye
did you ring sir ?
well you see i told her that i trusted her
you trusted her ?
wait a minute
i UNknown e got an idea
about them ?
why not them ?
but have you got anything definite ?
suppose i flirt with them and they come to my room
then what ?
then on the night the necklace disappeared they were seen near mrs potter 's
get it ?
that 's a grand idea
thanks kind sir
see you later
all the time you eat
that 's a no good
we gotta get the money
right now i 'd do anything for money
i 'd kill somebody for money
i 'd kill you for money
oh no you 'r e my friend
i kill you for nothin
what do you laugh eh ?
you 'r e in the hotel three hours and you no got a something yet
what do you got ?
a beautiful watch
i give up
i brought some pictures from headquarters
let me see your face
why you push huh ?
we no fight
we play this way
what 's your name ?
i 'm pretty suspicious of you birds
now you listen to me
i haven 't got anything on you yet but i 'm going to keep watching
i UNknown e got your full records right here in my pocket
there 's enough to send you up the minute you start anything
do you get me ?
you can 't wait a little bit huh ?
what do you got ?
you 'r e a detective
hurry along my dear
can you tell me what time is the next train to philadelphia ?
there 's a train once a week and sometimes twice a day
needs something taken out
that 's a good looking coat you have on
you like it huh ?
do you know you look like the prince of wales ?
that 's a my coat
that 's your coat ?
that 's a my coat
but it doesn 't fit you
tell me what are you doing tonight ?
maybe you got a good idea eh ?
well don 't you dare come to room 320 at 11 00
all right i come half past 10 00
did you see a handkerchief ?
i thought i dropped one
well it really doesn 't matter because what i 'm really interested in is you
did anyone ever tell you that you looked like the prince of wales ?
that 's funny
tell me do you know who i am ?
do you know my room number ?
well i UNknown l be there at 11 00 tonight
did anyone ever tell you you look like the prince of wales ?
i don 't mean the present prince of wales
one of the old wales
and believe me when i say wales i mean wales
i know a whale when i see one
did you say your room was 318 ?
i 'm the proprietor of this hotel and i have a passkey to every room in it
you know they passkey down the UNknown
won 't you uh lie down ?
aw if we could find a little bungalow eh ?
of course i know we could find one but maybe the people wouldn 't get out
but if we could find a nice little empty bungalow just for me and you where we could bill and cow
no where we could bull and cow
do you know what you 'r e trying to say ?
yes it 's not what i 'm thinking of
what i meant was if we had a nice little bungalow and you was inside and i was outside trying to get in or inside trying to get out
no i was in
i don 't think i understand
i mean your eyes your eyes they shine like the pants of a blue serge suit
that 's on the pants
what i meant was if we had a nice bungalow and i came home from work and you were standing by the gate
no you came home from work and i was standing by the gate
that 's more like it
and we came down the path and we went inside and the shades were drawn and the lights were low and uh then uh
are you sure your husband 's dead ?
you know a yes like that was once responsible for me jumping out of a window
and i 'm not the jumper i used to be
you did once
i love you
what in the world is the matter with you ?
oh i 'm not myself tonight
i don 't know who i am
one false move and i 'm yours
i love you
i might but i 'd keep my mouth shut
i UNknown l not stay here any longer and be insulted this way
no don 't go away and leave me here alone
you stay here and i UNknown l go away
i don 't know what to say
say that you UNknown l be truly mine or truly yours or yours truly
don 't you know that i 'm
will you keep your hands to yourself !
just think tonight tonight when the moon is sneaking around the clouds i UNknown l be sneaking around you
i UNknown l meet you tonight under the moon
oh i can see you now you and the moon
you wear a necktie so i UNknown l know you
send up some ice water right away
oh that 's fine
how do you mean ?
there 's bound to be trouble when she misses the necklace
i should say not
hide it ?
yes but where ?
a hollow tree stump about a mile from here
will that do ?
it 's cocoanut manor
i 'm not so sure harvey
here i UNknown l show you
now you you go right out cocoanut road
then there 's UNknown road like this but instead you take the granada road
suddenly you come to a clearing with a fringe of trees around it
that 's cocoanut manor where the stump is
it 's about 20 feet from the edge of the clearing
that 's where you put the jewels
you can 't miss it
now you take the necklace right out there see ?
i UNknown e got to go back downstairs or mrs potter will be suspicious
and be careful
everything 's going along UNknown now
do you remember me ?
the prince of wales ?
why yes of course i do
did he go ?
this hotel not only has running water it has running guests
mr hammer what are you doing in my room ?
i UNknown l find out about this outfit
well i guess there 's nobody in here
you don 't know where to look
what 's that you said ?
oh this is awful
well everything seems to be all right in here
i 'm not so sure about that
if you wanna keep him up in the room you UNknown l have to keep him in a trap
i can 't catch him
who is he ?
oh that 's your silent partner
well anyhow you wired me about some property
i UNknown e thought it over
now i can let you have three lots watering the front or i can let you have three lots UNknown the water
now these lots cost me 9 000 and i 'm gonna let you have them for 15 because i like you
i no buy nothing
i no got a one cent
how are you gonna pay for your room ?
that 's your lookout
well you see we come here to make money
i read in the paper and it say big boom in florida so we come
we 'r e a couple of big UNknown too
i UNknown l show you how you can make some real money
i 'm going to hold an auction in a little while in cocoanut manor
i say i 'm holding an auction at cocoanut manor
and when the crowd gathers around i want you to mingle with them
don 't pick their pockets just mingle with them
i UNknown l find time for both
well maybe we can cut out the auction
here 's what i mean
if somebody says 100 you say two
if somebody says two you say three
how am i gonna know when they no say nothin ?
well they UNknown l probably notify you
you fool if they don 't say anything you UNknown l hear UNknown m won 't you ?
well maybe i no listen
well don 't tell UNknown m
now then if we 'r e successful in disposing of these lots i UNknown l see that you get a nice commission
and how about some money ?
well you can have your choice
now in arranging these lots of course we use blueprints
you know what a blueprint is huh ?
it 's oysters
i go around by myself
yeah it 's too much
i don 't mean a whole lot
just a little lot with nothing on it
anytime you got a too much you got a whole lot
look i explain it to you
sometimes you no got a enough
sometimes you got a whole lot
sometimes you got a little bit
you no think it 's enough
somebody else maybe think it 's a too much
it 's a whole lot too
now a whole lot is a too much too much is a whole lot
now look this is a map and diagram of the whole cocoanut section
this whole area is within a radius of approximately three quarters of a mile
it 's a w j z
well i walked right into that one
it 's gonna be a cinch explaining the rest of this thing to you i can see that
i catch on quick
here 's cocoanut manor
where have you got cocoanut custard ?
that 's on one of the forks
you probably eat with your knife so you won 't have to worry about that
now here is the main road leading out of cocoanut manor
that 's the road i wish you were on
now over here on this site we 'r e gonna build an eye and ear hospital
this is gonna be a sight for sore eyes
you understand ?
people live there huh ?
no that 's the UNknown
now all along here this is the UNknown and all along the river all along the river those are all UNknown
that 's the jewish neighborhood ?
well we UNknown l pass over that
you 'r e a peach boy
now here is a little peninsula and here is a UNknown leading over to the mainland
why a duck ?
i say that 's a UNknown
i don 't know why a no chicken
i 'm a stranger here myself
all i know is that it 's a UNknown
you try to cross over there a chicken and you UNknown l find out UNknown
i no go someplace
it 's deep water
you couldn 't make it
it 's too deep
well i 'm sorry the matter ever came up
all i know is that it 's a UNknown
i no catch on to why a duck
well i was only fooling
i was only fooling
now is that clear to you ?
yes everything except why a duck
well that 's fine
now look i 'm gonna take you down and show you our cemetery
i UNknown e got a waiting list of 50 people at that cemetery just dying to get in
but i like you
i like you and i 'm gonna shove you in ahead of all of them

how about it you ?
why did you buy this lot ?
none of your business
mother he isn 't
who is she ?
you won 't say anything
this guy 's letting on to be a dummy
this bird you can 't understand when he does talk
wait a minute
that 's enough
i had no idea that you 'd do it
oh i feel awful
bob what does she mean ?
i didn 't want you to do it
i just meant that you could give me one like it
wait a minute
i 'm taking all the blame myself
i was joking and you took me seriously
bob last night when you told me that you 'd taken it i just couldn 't believe it
told you i 'd taken what ?
why polly she 's out of her mind
it sounds quite plausible to me
i begged him to take it back
say i 'm not gonna stand for any more of this
why the whole thing is ridiculous
it 's absurd !
polly you know it 's a lie don 't you ?
it was just a harmless UNknown and then well he lost his head
don 't you know it 's a lie ?
of course i do
mr adams i must ask you never to speak to my daughter again
but mrs potter

why the whole thing is ridiculous

well of course
what 's going on here ?
everything 's been dropping from on high here

you 'r e a lucky boy harvey

eat eat eat
i want to take this occasion of welcoming you to UNknown
no no i mean in recognition of my many years of service with the railroad you have presented me with these ties
and that of course reminds me of the story of the irishman
it 's so funny
oft in the UNknown night the trembling of a leaf can be heard sighing through the trees
and the babbling brook as it UNknown its way onward babbling and
well i got rid of one
and one like that is worth three ordinary ones
where was i ?
that 's right
UNknown and spring veal showed a firm tone
and eggs were a little touchy on a falling market
well my mother and father talked it over and they finally moved to new york
they took a little house in the bronx
and it was in that little house that abraham lincoln was born much to my father 's surprise
and that boys and girls was the beginning of the lincoln highway
and now friends in view of the fact that miss potter 's engagement is being celebrated here tonight so to speak
i think a few words from her mother would be revolting
i now take great pleasure in presenting to you the well preserved and partially pickled mrs potter
come on now
the old gal is stewed to the eyebrows
and now i want to wish you all a most enjoyable evening
as for myself i 'm sad
i simply can 't go any farther
i UNknown l get off with you
now friends i want to take great pleasure in presenting to you the groom mr yates mr harvey yates
good evening radio fans
stand by for your station announcer
my dear dear friends
well shut up
nevertheless mr hammer it was very nice of you to call on me
you must call on me sometime
i was just about to
yes come up and see my flower bed
what i intended to say
i want you to see my UNknown
i was just going to say that
next spring i 'm gonna get some early UNknown
as i was about to say
there seems to be a steady stream flowing in and out over there
i wouldn 't dream of taking up any more of your time
i really wanted to thank you all
well you certainly succeeded
that 's that good gulf gas
don 't do that
i don 't have to
they 'r e doing plenty
oh this is awful
we 'r e gonna have music
now the first musical number on the program will be a piccolo solo which we will skip
and the second number will be senor pastrami the UNknown pianist
the senor for his first selection will play a cup of coffee a sandwich and you
senor allow me to escort you to the diet
uh senor pastrami what is the first number ?
down in front
the little lady who is to become mrs harvey yates over my dead body
i know i have the sincere wishes of all my friends and can only tell you how much i appreciate it
i think i can honestly say this is the happiest moment of my life
look what i have here
it 's a little engagement present just given me by mr yates
he wrote it just now but he wrote another yesterday when a necklace was stolen
they are both in his handwriting
let me read it to you
it shows how to get to cocoanut manor and the hollow tree stump and reads hollow stump jewels
i don 't believe it
see for yourself
it 's a good thing it was my personal check
tell him i UNknown e got one
well i think you will want to see him
his name is mr john w UNknown
he has accepted my UNknown plans for the development of cocoanut manor
well happy days old boy
400 guests ?
mother you must admit you were mistaken
mr adams how can you ever forgive me ?
oh please mrs potter
the wedding will take place exactly as planned
that is with the exception of a slight change
she will be married to mr robert adams
lively instrumental music
what 's wrong ?
we wanna get paid
is that fair ?
if washington 's soldiers asked for money where would this country be today ?
but they did ask
no my friends
that might be a UNknown but i doubt it
if you UNknown l all stick with me and work hard we UNknown l forget about money
let 's get together and make a regular hotel of this place
i UNknown l put writing paper in the hotel
and next year if you behave i UNknown l put in envelopes
i UNknown l put extra blankets free in all your rooms
there UNknown l be no cover charge
three years ago i came to florida without a nickel
now i UNknown e got a nickel
that 's all very well mr hammer
but we haven 't been paid in two weeks and we want our wages
answer me that
remember there 's nothing like liberty except UNknown and the saturday evening post
be free my friends
there you are
now if you boys will only be calm
we arrive this afternoon on the 4 30
kindly reserve two floors and three ceilings
must be mice
western union and they UNknown e got a lot of money too
on the 4 15 ?
well i UNknown l take the bus down myself
this hotel will be so crowded that we UNknown l be turning away thousands of people
if there is another hotel in cocoanut beach cancel our reservations
i knew it
can you come to the wedding ?
you see everything is all right boys
you 'r e all invited to the wedding of aunt fanny 's 8 pound boy
in the meantime i want you to buck up get down to work
let 's put this thing over with a bang
and above all forget about money
don 't think of it because you won 't get it anyway
UNknown cheering merrily
UNknown i 'm going down to meet the 4 15
if i never come back i UNknown l be still waiting for the train
in my absence i 'm relying on you to handle everything
you can depend upon me sir
that 's fine
and think of me
all right sir
i 'm not worried about a hotel clerk
no but i UNknown l bet you 'r e worried about the potter millions
you generally could use money in the old days
lay off that stuff
i can take care of myself
i doubt it
what do you mean ?
have you ever seen that diamond necklace of mrs potter 's ?
you bet i have
her room and my room are right next to each other
hers is 318
the key is always in her bag
that 's what you UNknown e got to get
it 's a large order but maybe it can be done
suppose i invite mrs potter and polly to take supper with me tonight ?
what then ?
now you 'r e talking
that sounds more like old times
now i UNknown l try and get rid of bob adams for you
romantic instrumental music
what a question
true but that 's why there hasn 't been any development here
couldn 't it be cut down ?
UNknown practically built palm beach and miami but he said he wouldn 't touch this
when a man like that passes a place up no one wants it
do you know anything about architecture ?
no but i 'd love to learn
i made a drawing of the whole place showing the hills as a built up scheme without cutting down the hill or having it get in the way
i made the hill fit in with the UNknown scheme
i sent UNknown a copy last week
his secretary wrote me saying they were studying my plans
that 's thrilling
if he only does i 'm sure it will be the most beautiful place in the world
it would be if you lived there
look see what i UNknown e written ?
heaven for polly and me
that looks great
any day now
let 's make it come true
when my dreams come true
and i UNknown l be smiling through
when my dreams come true
that spanish castle i built in my mind
will be a love nest of the practical kind
and i UNknown l be there with you
when my dreams come true
ever since i met you
all that i seem to do is dream
when will i realise my dreams ?
when my dreams come true
and i UNknown l be smiling through
when my dreams come true
that spanish castle i built in my mind
will be a love nest of the practical kind
and i UNknown l be there with you
i am looking
let 's find out
she generally is and she generally finds me
you know mother
i 'd like to hear the rest of it sometime
well miracles do happen
but only for a little while mother
why a daughter of mine should fool around with a hotel clerk when she has the opportunity of marrying one of the boston yates
is more than i can understand
who cares about the boston yates ?
anyway bob isn 't a clerk
he 's an architect
one who clerks is a clerk and that settles it
and i want you to remember that no potter has ever been involved in a single scandal
how about uncle dick ?
it 's a well known fact that your uncle was drunk at the time
you ought to stop drinking so much coffee
i 'm sorry sir
yes it didn 't hit me
that 's the only luck i had
i think i know what 's wrong with the hotel
i know too
maybe the hotel hasn 't opened yet
don 't worry
and making the beds
how do you do ?
why don 't you whistle at the crossing ?
you 'r e just the woman i 'm looking for
i 'm gonna tell you about florida real estate
first time it 's ever been mentioned down here
i 'm sorry but
this is the biggest development since sophie tucker
florida is the show spot of america and cocoanut beach is the black spot of florida ?
you told me about this yesterday
but i left out a comma
soon we 'r e holding an auction at cocoanut manor the suburb terrible beautiful
you must come
if you don 't like UNknown we can play contract
here it is
1 600 miles as the crow flies 1 800 as the UNknown
it 's the most exclusive residential district in florida
nobody lives there
our motto is cocoanut beach
no snow no ice and no business
florida is the greatest state in the union
is it ?
take all the alligator pears and keep them
see if i care
i haven 't the least idea
because you UNknown e never been an alligator and don 't let it happen again
it sometimes requires years to bring the pear and alligator together
they don 't like each other
i don 't think so
all they can get a hold of
florida feeds the nation but nobody feeds me
that 's what i want to discuss with you
also take our cattle raising
i don 't mean anything personal
but here is the ideal cattle raising section
we have UNknown UNknown and UNknown
will you let me say something please ?
i don 't think so
there 's something else i wanna tell you
where will you be when you 'r e 65 ?
that 's about three months from now
if i were to buy i should prefer some place like palm beach
palm beach ?
the slums of tomorrow ?
you know the population of cocoanut beach doubled last week ?
has it ?
sorry i 'm afraid i must be going
nobody can fool a woman like you on a sewer pipe can they ?
this is the 8 inch pipe
all property owners will be allowed to vote on the size
in case of a tie it goes to the supreme court
i can give you a little inside information in advance
here put it in your pocket
see you later
i don 't want it
is that so ?
you want some ?
no i haven 't
in a nice quiet spot
a nice quiet spot ?
tell her she can eat in the lobby
we ought to dress this place up a bit
it looks terrible
i haven 't seen them
i 'm gonna fire some of them
give me the firing bell
stick around here
look at him
come over here
explain your business
how do you do ?
how are you ?
what do you want ?
i see you 'r e here for the winter
step this way
okay we stay for the summer too
sorry we haven 't got any vacancies
you want a room ?
we UNknown l fill it up before we leave
you UNknown l empty it before i go out
step this way boys
anybody else ?
a suite on the third floor ?
i UNknown l take a polack in the basement
you UNknown l have to take that up with the UNknown department
that 's an entirely different proposition and i can 't
i can use you the first of the month
what do you want ?
do you want a single room ?
we 'd like to double up
eat some green apples
i can 't hear you
if you UNknown l take your nose out of the receiver it UNknown l be okay
you wanna know where you can get a hold of mrs potter ?
i don 't know
they 'r e UNknown
i don 't want you to get any of the worst ones
i 'm so glad
i have some very important business to attend to
i 'm going upstairs to get your partner a stomach pump
i UNknown l be down in a few minutes
and while i 'm gone don 't forget
all right goodbye
harpo rings bell
well i told her that i trusted her
you trusted her ?
i could kill those tramps
wait a minute
i UNknown e got an idea
about them ?
why not them ?
but have you got anything definite ?
suppose i flirt with them and they come to my room
then what ?
then the night the necklace disappeared they were seen near mrs potter 's
get it ?
that 's a grand idea
thanks kind sir
see you later
all the time you eat
that 's no good
right now i 'd do anything for money
i 'd kill someone for it
i 'd kill you for money
i kill you for nothing
why do you laugh ?
you 'r e here for three hours and you no got something yet
what do you got ?
a beautiful watch
i give up
i brought some pictures from headquarters
let me see your face
why you push ?
what are you guys fighting for ?
no that 's my friend
we play this way
what 's your name ?
i 'm pretty suspicious of you birds
now you listen to me
i haven 't got anything on you yet but i 'm going to keep watching
i UNknown e got your full records right here in my pocket
there 's enough to send you up the minute you start anything
you get me ?
you can 't wait a little bit
what do you got ?
you 'r e a detective
hurry along my dear
can you tell me what time is the next train to philadelphia ?
there 's a train once a week and sometimes twice a day
needs something taken out
that 's fine
that 's a good looking coat you have on
you like it ?
that 's my coat
that 's my coat
tell me what are you doing tonight ?
maybe you got a good idea ?
don 't you dare come to room 320 at 11 00
all right i come at 10 30
harpo playing the clarinet
i thought i had dropped one
it really doesn 't matter because what i 'm really interested in is you
penelope giggles UNknown
that 's funny
tell me do you know who i am ?
do you know my room number ?
i UNknown l be there at 11 00 tonight
playing a slow tune
not the present prince of wales
one of the old wales
and believe me when i say wales i mean wales
i know a whale when i see one
did you say your room was 318 ?
i 'm the proprietor of this hotel and i have a passkey to every room in it
you know they passkey down the UNknown
won 't you lie down ?
if we could find a little bungalow
of course i know we could find one but maybe the people wouldn 't get out
if we could find a nice little empty bungalow just for me and you where we could bill and cow
no where we could bull and cow
do you know what you 'r e trying to say ?
yes it 's not what i 'm thinking of
what i meant was if we had a nice little bungalow and you were inside and i was outside trying to get in or inside trying to get out
no i was in
i don 't think i understand
i mean your eyes they shine like the pants of a blue serge suit
that 's on the pants
what i meant was if we had a nice bungalow
i came home from work and you were standing by the gate
no you came home from work and i was standing by the gate
that 's more like it
and we came down the path and we went inside
and the shades were drawn and the lights were low and
are you sure your husband 's dead ?
a yes like that was once responsible for me jumping out of a window
and i 'm not the jumper i used to be
what i meant was you 'r e gonna be here all winter and i 'm stuck with the hotel anyhow
why don 't you grab me until you can make other arrangements ?
my dear mr hammer i shall never get married before my daughter
you did once
what in the world is the matter with you ?
i 'm not myself tonight
i don 't know who i am
one false move and i 'm yours
i love you
i might but i 'd keep my mouth shut
don 't go and leave me alone
you stay and i UNknown l go away
i don 't know what to say
say that you UNknown l be truly mine or truly yours or yours truly
come on i UNknown l play you one more game
just think tonight when the moon is sneaking around the clouds i UNknown l be sneaking around you
i UNknown l meet you tonight under the moon
i can see you now
you and the moon
playing soothing music
that 's right
that 's fine
how do you mean ?
there UNknown l be trouble when she misses it
well we can 't have it found on us
i should say not
hide it ?
but where ?
a hollow tree stump a mile from here
will that do ?
i 'm not so sure harvey
here i UNknown l show you
you go right down cocoanut road
then there 's UNknown road like this
instead you take the granada road
suddenly you come to a clearing with a fringe of trees around it
that 's cocoanut manor where the stump is
it 's about 20 feet from the edge of the clearing
that 's where you put the jewels
you can 't miss it
you take the necklace out there see ?
i UNknown e got to go back downstairs or mrs potter will be suspicious
and be careful
everything 's going along UNknown now
you remember me the prince of wales ?
of course i do
if there 's gonna be two people in this room it UNknown l be 50 cents extra
did he go ?
you remember me the prince of wales ?
who is it ?
knocking on door
mr hammer what are you doing in my room ?
thank goodness he 's gone
never mind operator
i guess there 's nobody in here
you don 't know where to look
what 's that you said ?
this is awful
everything seems to be all right in here
knocking on door
sighs in relief
you UNknown l have to keep him in a trap in your room
i can 't catch him
who is he ?
that 's your silent partner ?
you wired me about some property
i UNknown e thought it over
i can let you have three lots watering the front or three lots UNknown the water
these lots cost me 9 000
i UNknown l let you have them for 15 000 because i like you
i no buy nothing
i no got one cent
how are you gonna pay for your room ?
that 's your lookout
you see we come here to make money
i read in paper big boom in florida
so we come
i UNknown l show you how you can make some real money
i 'm gonna hold an auction in a little while in cocoanut manor

i don 't UNknown
this little lady has lost a necklace worth 100 000 and she offers 1 000 reward for its return
chlco 2 000
all you people get back and give us plenty of room and keep quiet
he hurt you ?
no push boy
i don 't know where he 's from
he hasn 't any license on him
so that 's it
grabbing off stuff for the reward eh ?
now then you come clean
let go of that
officer may i make a suggestion ?
what is it ?
why was he so anxious to buy it ?
why did you buy this lot ?
none of your business
mother he isn 't
who is she ?
you won 't say anything
this guy 's letting on to be a dummy
is there anybody here who will talk ?
i will but i can 't think of anything
well if you won 't tell me about it you UNknown l tell somebody else
wait a minute
i had no idea that you 'd do it
i feel awful
bob what does she mean ?
i had no idea he 'd think that i meant it
i didn 't want you to do it
i just meant that you could give me one like it
wait a minute
i 'm taking all the blame myself
i was joking and you took me seriously
when you told me you 'd taken it i just couldn 't believe it
told you i 'd taken what ?
why polly she 's out of her mind
it sounds quite plausible to me
i begged him to take it back
say i 'm not gonna stand for any more of this
why the whole thing is ridiculous
it 's absurd
i don 't care what you think any of you
polly you know it 's a lie don 't you ?
it was just a harmless UNknown and then he lost his head
don 't you know it 's a lie ?
of course i do
mr adams i must ask you never to speak to my daughter again
bob i 'm going with you
you UNknown l stay here
don 't keep it up any longer
come on you
i UNknown e been so unsuccessful in disposing these other lots that i UNknown l give a half a pound of tea with every lot i sell
there 's one way to wipe out this disgrace
you must make people forget that you ever knew this young man
you see what 's come of your way
now i 'm going to have mine
mr yates ?
that 's wonderful polly
a dinner ?
you may invite everyone
let me be the last to congratulate you and you too
i 'm sure you UNknown l have a very dismal wedding
UNknown instrumental music
that 's fine
i didn 't know they allowed visitors
we come to get you out
we gotta be quick
i might as well stay here
you gotta come out
to who ?
everybody 's gonna be there
that 's right
we get you out
not at a time like this
what did you do ?
go up and see if you can get me a seat
all right bob
these gentlemen helped me to get out
i 'm ever so much obliged to you
they told me it was your idea
i can 't begin to thank you
maybe you do as much for me sometime
well arrivederci good bye
jail is no place for a young fella
there 's no advancement
what 's the use of worrying ?
you 'r e gone today and here tomorrow
but you know it was a lie
how am i gonna prove it ?
i think the third floor is missing
i UNknown l put this stuff in here until i get ready to go upstairs
wait just a moment
you can beat that but you can 't tie it

it 's a conspiracy

his excellency the ambassador from san UNknown
senor de UNknown
i can see me old mother coming down the old path
and i can see the old
harpo whistles UNknown
i 'm so glad you came mr hennessy

now ladies and gentlemen if you UNknown l all find places at the table we UNknown l have a short entertainment before supper
ladies and gentlemen mr hammer will now act as master of ceremonies
on behalf of the UNknown club of UNknown
i want to take this occasion of welcoming you to UNknown
no i mean in recognition of my many years of service with the railroad you have presented me with these ties
and that of course reminds me of the story of the irishman
oft in the UNknown night the trembling of a leaf can be heard
sighing through the trees and the babbling brook
as it UNknown its way onward babbling and
well i got rid of one
and one like that is worth three ordinary ones
where was i ?
UNknown and spring veal showed a firm tone
and eggs were a little touchy on a falling market
my mother and father talked it over and they finally moved to new york
they took a little house in the bronx and it was in that house that abraham lincoln was born quite to my father 's surprise
and that boys and girls was the beginning of the lincoln highway
friends in view of the fact that miss polly 's engagement is being celebrated here tonight
i think a few words from her mother would be revolting
i now take great pleasure in presenting to you the well preserved and partially pickled mrs potter
come on now give the little girl a big hand
speech big speech
as i look into your faces they 'r e all lit with gay laughter
the whole world and everything in it is bathed in a soft flowing luminous haze
the old gal is stewed to the eyebrows
and now i want to wish you all a most enjoyable evening
as for myself i 'm sad
i simply can 't go any further
i UNknown l get off with you
now friends i want to take great pleasure in presenting to you the groom mr yates
mr harvey yates
stand by for your station announcer
my dear dear friends
well shut up
you must call on me sometime
i was just about to
come up and see my flower beds
what i intended to say
i 'd like you to see my UNknown
the short UNknown and long UNknown
i was just going to say
next spring i UNknown l get some early UNknown
as i was about to say
there seems to be a steady stream flowing in and out over there
i wouldn 't dream of taking up any more of your time
i really wanted to thank you all and as i said before
i hadn 't intended to make a speech at all
but you certainly succeeded
mrs potter muttering UNknown
mr hammer can 't you do something ?
they 'r e doing plenty
now ladies and gentlemen the first musical number that we intend to UNknown will be the beginning and ending of a very
we 'r e gonna have music
the first musical number on the programme will be a piccolo solo which we will skip
the second number will be senor pastrami the UNknown pianist
senor for his first selection will play a cup of coffee a sandwich and you from the opera aida
senor allow me to escort you to the UNknown
senor pastrami what is the first number ?
down in front
i know i have the sincere wishes of all my friends
i can only tell you how much i appreciate it
i think i can honestly say this is the happiest moment of my life
look what i have here
it 's a little engagement present just given me by mr yates
he wrote it just now
but he wrote another yesterday when a necklace was stolen
they are both in his handwriting
let me read it to you
it shows how to get to cocoanut manor and the hollow tree stump and reads hollow stump jewels
it 's a good thing it was my personal check
tell him i UNknown e got one
i think you will want to see him
his name is mr john w UNknown
he has accepted my UNknown plans for the development of cocoanut manor
he also wants to know if you can accommodate 400 guests for the weekend
what is it ?
mr adams how can you ever forgive me ?
please mrs potter
the wedding will take place exactly as planned
that is with the exception of a slight change
she will be married to mr robert adams
when my dreams come true
and i UNknown l be smiling through
when my dreams come true
that spanish castle
will be our love nest
the practical kind
when my dreams
we wanna see you mr hammer
what 's the matter ?
somebody pay their bill ?
we want our money
we wanna get paid
is that fair ?
suppose george washington 's soldiers had asked for money ?
where would this country be today ?
but they did ask
no my friends
that might be a UNknown but i doubt it
we want our money
if you UNknown l all stick with me and work hard we UNknown l forget about money
let 's get together and we UNknown l make a regular hotel out of this place
i UNknown l put writing paper in the hotel and next year if you behave yourselves i UNknown l put in envelopes
i 'm gonna put extra blankets free in all your rooms
there UNknown l be no cover charge
think of the opportunities here in florida
three years ago i came to florida without a nickel in my pocket
and now i UNknown e got a nickel in my pocket
that 's all very well mr hammer but we haven 't been paid in two weeks and we want our wages
answer me that
there you are
now if you UNknown boys will only be calm
uh huh we arrive this afternoon on the 4 30
kindly reserve two floors and three ceilings they must be mice
if we like your property we will immediately buy it
see that things have started our way already
who 's it from ?
western union and they UNknown e got a lot of money too
on the 4 15 eh ?
well i UNknown l take the bus down myself
here 's another one mr hammer
see we 'r e gonna be stuffed by tonight
this hotel will be so crowded that we UNknown l be turning away thousands of people
if there is another hotel in cocoanut beach cancel our reservations
i knew it
aunt fanny had an eight pound boy
can you come to the wedding ?
you see everything is all right boys
everything is all right
in the meantime i want you to buck up get down to work
let 's put this thing over with a bang
and above all forget about money
don 't think of it
just forget about it because you won 't get it anyway
UNknown i 'm going down to meet the 4 15
if i never come back you UNknown l know i 'm still waiting for the train
you can depend upon me sir
that 's fine
and think of me UNknown
you bet i will
all right sir
i 'm not worried about a hotel clerk
no but i UNknown l bet you 'r e worried about the potter millions
you generally could use money in the old days
oh lay off that stuff
you know marrying polly is the only way for you to square your debts
i can take care of myself
i doubt it
what do you mean ?
have you ever seen that diamond necklace of mrs potter 's ?
you bet i have
her room and my room are right next to each other
hers is 318 ; mine 320
the door between is unlocked
the key is always in her bag
that 's what you UNknown e got to get
it 's a large order but maybe it can be done
suppose i invite mrs potter and polly to take supper with me tonight ?
what then ?
now you 'r e talking
that sounds more like old times
and now i will try and get rid of bob adams for you
look this is cocoanut manor
you know that hill ?
what a question
it 's cunning all right
but that 's why there hasn 't been any development here
couldn 't it be cut down ?
john w UNknown was here to see it last month
you know UNknown practically built palm beach and miami but he said he wouldn 't touch this
now when a man like that passes a place up no one wants it
do you know anything about architecture ?
no but i 'd love to learn
well i made a drawing of the whole place showing the hills
it 's a built up scheme without cutting down the hill or having it get in the way
i made the hill fit in with the UNknown scheme
i sent UNknown a copy last week and his secretary wrote me a nice note saying they were studying my plans
that 's thrilling
say i may be an architect yet
if he only does i 'm sure it will be the most beautiful place in the world
it would be if you lived there
look see what i UNknown e written ?
heaven for polly and me
that looks great
any day now
let 's make it come true
will be a love nest
the practical kind
all that i seem to do
when will i realize
will be a love nest
the practical kind
i am looking
i wonder who it can be
let 's find out
she generally is and she generally finds me
you know mother
i 'd like to hear the rest of it sometime
well miracles do happen
but only for a little while mother
why a daughter of mine should fool around with a hotel clerk when she has the opportunity of marrying one of the boston yates is more than i can understand
oh who cares about the boston yates ?
anyway bob isn 't a clerk
he 's an architect
one who clerks polly is a clerk and that settles it
and i want you to remember that no potter has ever been involved in a single scandal
how about uncle dick ?
polly it 's a well known fact that your uncle was drunk at the time
you ought to cut out drinking so much coffee
i 'm sorry sir
yes it didn 't hit me
that 's the only luck i had with it
mr hammer i think i know what 's wrong with the hotel
i think i know too
you 'r e fired
maybe the season hasn 't started yet
maybe the hotel hasn 't opened yet
don 't worry mr hammer
in a few weeks you UNknown l be cleaning up
yes and making the beds
go on get out of here
i can handle this rush myself
600 rooms in the hotel and you have to sleep here
how do you do mr hammer ?
why don 't you whistle at the crossing ?
you 'r e just the woman i 'm looking for
now whether you like it or not i 'm gonna tell you about florida real estate
it 's the first time it 's ever been mentioned down here today
i 'm sorry but
do you know that this is the biggest development since sophie tucker ?
do you know that florida is the show spot of america and cocoanut beach is the black spot of florida ?
you told me about this yesterday
i know but i left out a comma
you must come over
if you don 't like UNknown we can play contract
here it is
1 600 miles as the crow flies 1 800 as the UNknown
there you are cocoanut manor UNknown the american sewer and the florida sucker
why it 's the most exclusive residential district in florida
nobody lives there
our motto is cocoanut beach no snow no ice and no business
do you know that florida is the greatest state in the union ?
is it ?
take all the alligator pears and keep UNknown m
see if i care
haven 't the slightest idea
that 's because you UNknown e never been an alligator and don 't let it happen again
do you know that it sometimes requires years to bring the pear and the alligator together ?
they don 't like each other
i don 't think i do
all they can get a hold of
florida feeds the nation but nobody feeds me and that 's what i wanna talk to you about
i don 't mean anything personal
but here is the ideal cattle raising section
we have UNknown UNknown and UNknown
mr hammer will you let me say something please ?
i hardly think so and there 's something else i wanna bring to your mind
where will you be when you 'r e 65 ?
that 's only about three months from now
if i were to buy i should prefer someplace like palm beach
palm beach ?
the slums of tomorrow ?
do you know that the population of cocoanut beach has doubled in the past week ?
has it ?
i 'm sorry but i 'm afraid i must be going
aw now don 't go
before you go let me show you a sample of our sewer pipe we 'r e gonna lay
look at it
now this is the eight inch pipe
but of course all property owners will be allowed to vote on the size of their pipe
in case of a tie it goes to the supreme court and i can give you a little inside information in advance
the chief justice is crazy about this type of sewer
here put it in your pocket
i UNknown l see you later
mr hammer i can 't use this
i don 't want it
is that so ?
oh you want some ?
oh that 's different
no i haven 't
get some onions
a nice quiet spot ?
we ought to dress this place up a bit
it looks terrible
UNknown what 's become of our front ?
are we all out of front ?
i haven 't seen UNknown m
i 'm gonna fire some of those people
give me the fire bell
why don 't you stick around here
if anybody comes in that looks like a customer tie UNknown m and brand UNknown m
hey come on

you know they passkey down the UNknown
won 't you uh lie down ?
aw if we could find a little bungalow eh ?
of course i know we could find one but maybe the people wouldn 't get out
but if we could find a nice little empty bungalow just for me and you where we could bill and cow
no where we could bull and cow
do you know what you 'r e trying to say ?
yes it 's not what i 'm thinking of
what i meant was if we had a nice little bungalow and you was inside and i was outside trying to get in or inside trying to get out
no i was in
i don 't think i understand
i mean your eyes your eyes they shine like the pants of a blue serge suit
that 's on the pants
what i meant was if we had a nice bungalow and i came home from work and you were standing by the gate
no you came home from work and i was standing by the gate
that 's more like it
and we came down the path and we went inside and the shades were drawn and the lights were low and uh then uh
are you sure your husband 's dead ?
you know a yes like that was once responsible for me jumping out of a window
and i 'm not the jumper i used to be
you did once
i love you
what in the world is the matter with you ?
oh i 'm not myself tonight
i don 't know who i am
one false move and i 'm yours
i love you
i might but i 'd keep my mouth shut
i UNknown l not stay here any longer and be insulted this way
no don 't go away and leave me here alone
you stay here and i UNknown l go away
i don 't know what to say
say that you UNknown l be truly mine or truly yours or yours truly
don 't you know that i 'm
will you keep your hands to yourself !
just think tonight tonight when the moon is sneaking around the clouds i UNknown l be sneaking around you
i UNknown l meet you tonight under the moon
oh i can see you now you and the moon
you wear a necktie so i UNknown l know you
send up some ice water right away
oh that 's fine
how do you mean ?
there 's bound to be trouble when she misses the necklace
i should say not
hide it ?
yes but where ?
a hollow tree stump about a mile from here
will that do ?
it 's cocoanut manor
i 'm not so sure harvey
here i UNknown l show you
now you you go right out cocoanut road
then there 's UNknown road like this but instead you take the granada road
suddenly you come to a clearing with a fringe of trees around it
that 's cocoanut manor where the stump is
it 's about 20 feet from the edge of the clearing
that 's where you put the jewels
you can 't miss it
now you take the necklace right out there see ?
i UNknown e got to go back downstairs or mrs potter will be suspicious
and be careful
everything 's going along UNknown now
do you remember me ?
the prince of wales ?
why yes of course i do
did he go ?
this hotel not only has running water it has running guests
mr hammer what are you doing in my room ?
i UNknown l find out about this outfit
well i guess there 's nobody in here
you don 't know where to look
what 's that you said ?
oh this is awful
well everything seems to be all right in here
i 'm not so sure about that
if you wanna keep him up in the room you UNknown l have to keep him in a trap
i can 't catch him
who is he ?
oh that 's your silent partner
well anyhow you wired me about some property
i UNknown e thought it over
now i can let you have three lots watering the front or i can let you have three lots UNknown the water
now these lots cost me 9 000 and i 'm gonna let you have them for 15 because i like you
i no buy nothing
i no got a one cent
how are you gonna pay for your room ?
that 's your lookout
well you see we come here to make money
i read in the paper and it say big boom in florida so we come
we 'r e a couple of big UNknown too
i UNknown l show you how you can make some real money
i 'm going to hold an auction in a little while in cocoanut manor
i say i 'm holding an auction at cocoanut manor
and when the crowd gathers around i want you to mingle with them
don 't pick their pockets just mingle with them
i UNknown l find time for both
well maybe we can cut out the auction
here 's what i mean
if somebody says 100 you say two
if somebody says two you say three
how am i gonna know when they no say nothin ?
well they UNknown l probably notify you
you fool if they don 't say anything you UNknown l hear UNknown m won 't you ?
well maybe i no listen
well don 't tell UNknown m
now then if we 'r e successful in disposing of these lots i UNknown l see that you get a nice commission
and how about some money ?
well you can have your choice
now in arranging these lots of course we use blueprints
you know what a blueprint is huh ?
it 's oysters
i go around by myself
yeah it 's too much
i don 't mean a whole lot
just a little lot with nothing on it
anytime you got a too much you got a whole lot
look i explain it to you
sometimes you no got a enough
sometimes you got a whole lot
sometimes you got a little bit
you no think it 's enough
somebody else maybe think it 's a too much
it 's a whole lot too
now a whole lot is a too much too much is a whole lot
now look this is a map and diagram of the whole cocoanut section
this whole area is within a radius of approximately three quarters of a mile
it 's a w j z
well i walked right into that one
it 's gonna be a cinch explaining the rest of this thing to you i can see that
i catch on quick
here 's cocoanut manor

you probably eat with your knife so you won 't have to worry about that
now here is the main road leading out of cocoanut manor

you try to cross over there a chicken and you UNknown l find out UNknown
i no go someplace
it 's deep water

how about it you ?
why did you buy this lot ?
none of your business
mother he isn 't
who is she ?
you won 't say anything
this guy 's letting on to be a dummy
this bird you can 't understand when he does talk
wait a minute
that 's enough
i had no idea that you 'd do it
oh i feel awful
bob what does she mean ?
i didn 't want you to do it
i just meant that you could give me one like it
wait a minute
i 'm taking all the blame myself
i was joking and you took me seriously
bob last night when you told me that you 'd taken it i just couldn 't believe it
told you i 'd taken what ?
why polly she 's out of her mind
it sounds quite plausible to me
i begged him to take it back
say i 'm not gonna stand for any more of this
why the whole thing is ridiculous
it 's absurd !
polly you know it 's a lie don 't you ?
it was just a harmless UNknown and then well he lost his head
don 't you know it 's a lie ?
of course i do
mr adams i must ask you never to speak to my daughter again
but mrs potter
you UNknown l stay here
why the whole thing is ridiculous
you ready ?
don 't keep it up any longer
come on you
now we UNknown l take lot number 27
you must make people forget that you ever knew this young man
you see what 's come of your way
now i 'm going to have mine
mr yates ?
that 's wonderful polly
a dinner ?
you may invite everyone
in honor of the engagement of my daughter to mr harvey yates
i 'm sure you UNknown l have a very dismal wedding
that 's fine
we get a bob out
how do you do ?
i didn 't know they allowed visitors here
i 'm a no visitor
we come to get you out
we gotta be quick too
thanks very much
i might as well stay here as any other place

everybody 's gonna be there
that 's right
thanks very much
not at a time like this
we get you out
what a you do eh ?
what 's a matter for you ?
oh come on
go up there and knock on the door and see if you can get me a seat
all right bob
i 'm ever so much obliged to you mr
i can 't begin to thank you
that 's all right
jail is no place for a young fella
there 's no advancement
now what 's the use of worrying ?
it 's silly to worry isn 't it ?
you 'r e gone today and here tomorrow
but you know it was a lie
how am i gonna prove it ?
well of course
what 's going on here ?
everything 's been dropping from on high here
i think the third floor is missing
i UNknown l put this stuff in here until i get ready to go upstairs
wait just a moment
more papers than any man i UNknown e ever knew
come here with that will you
you can beat that but you can 't tie it
that 's a great guy you picked to ask
where did you find this ?
mr hammer whoever drew this knows something about that robbery
will be our love nest
the practical kind
thanks so much mrs potter
oh isn 't it lovely
you 'r e a lucky boy harvey
i hope so
anywhere that you are

there goes the weasel now
i 'm awfully glad you came mr
at a party like this you UNknown e got to have the law around

eat eat eat
i want to take this occasion of welcoming you to UNknown
no no i mean in recognition of my many years of service with the railroad you have presented me with these ties
and that of course reminds me of the story of the irishman
it 's so funny
oft in the UNknown night the trembling of a leaf can be heard sighing through the trees
and the babbling brook as it UNknown its way onward babbling and
well i got rid of one
and one like that is worth three ordinary ones
where was i ?
that 's right
UNknown and spring veal showed a firm tone
and eggs were a little touchy on a falling market
well my mother and father talked it over and they finally moved to new york
they took a little house in the bronx
and it was in that little house that abraham lincoln was born much to my father 's surprise
and that boys and girls was the beginning of the lincoln highway
and now friends in view of the fact that miss potter 's engagement is being celebrated here tonight so to speak
i think a few words from her mother would be revolting
i now take great pleasure in presenting to you the well preserved and partially pickled mrs potter
come on now
the old gal is stewed to the eyebrows
and now i want to wish you all a most enjoyable evening
as for myself i 'm sad
i simply can 't go any farther
i UNknown l get off with you
now friends i want to take great pleasure in presenting to you the groom mr yates mr harvey yates
good evening radio fans
stand by for your station announcer
my dear dear friends
well shut up
nevertheless mr hammer it was very nice of you to call on me
you must call on me sometime
i was just about to
yes come up and see my flower bed
what i intended to say
i want you to see my UNknown
i was just going to say that
next spring i 'm gonna get some early UNknown
as i was about to say
there seems to be a steady stream flowing in and out over there
i wouldn 't dream of taking up any more of your time
i really wanted to thank you all
well you certainly succeeded
that 's that good gulf gas
don 't do that
i don 't have to
they 'r e doing plenty
oh this is awful
we 'r e gonna have music
now the first musical number on the program will be a piccolo solo which we will skip
and the second number will be senor pastrami the UNknown pianist
the senor for his first selection will play a cup of coffee a sandwich and you
senor allow me to escort you to the diet
uh senor pastrami what is the first number ?
down in front
the little lady who is to become mrs harvey yates over my dead body
i know i have the sincere wishes of all my friends and can only tell you how much i appreciate it
i think i can honestly say this is the happiest moment of my life
look what i have here
it 's a little engagement present just given me by mr yates
he wrote it just now but he wrote another yesterday when a necklace was stolen
they are both in his handwriting
let me read it to you
it shows how to get to cocoanut manor and the hollow tree stump and reads hollow stump jewels
i don 't believe it
see for yourself
it 's a good thing it was my personal check
tell him i UNknown e got one
well i think you will want to see him
his name is mr john w UNknown
he has accepted my UNknown plans for the development of cocoanut manor
well happy days old boy
400 guests ?
mother you must admit you were mistaken
mr adams how can you ever forgive me ?
oh please mrs potter
the wedding will take place exactly as planned
that is with the exception of a slight change
she will be married to mr robert adams
what 's the matter ?
somebody pay their bill ?
we want our money
we wanna get paid
is that fair ?
suppose george washington 's soldiers had asked for money ?
where would this country be today ?
but they did ask
no my friends
that might be a UNknown but i doubt it
we want our money
if you UNknown l all stick with me and work hard we UNknown l forget about money
let 's get together and we UNknown l make a regular hotel out of this place
i UNknown l put writing paper in the hotel and next year if you behave yourselves i UNknown l put in envelopes
i 'm gonna put extra blankets free in all your rooms
there UNknown l be no cover charge
think of the opportunities here in florida
three years ago i came to florida without a nickel in my pocket
and now i UNknown e got a nickel in my pocket
that 's all very well mr hammer but we haven 't been paid in two weeks and we want our wages
answer me that
there you are
now if you UNknown boys will only be calm
uh huh we arrive this afternoon on the 4 30
kindly reserve two floors and three ceilings they must be mice
if we like your property we will immediately buy it
see that things have started our way already
who 's it from ?
western union and they UNknown e got a lot of money too
on the 4 15 eh ?
well i UNknown l take the bus down myself
here 's another one mr hammer
see we 'r e gonna be stuffed by tonight
this hotel will be so crowded that we UNknown l be turning away thousands of people
if there is another hotel in cocoanut beach cancel our reservations
i knew it
aunt fanny had an eight pound boy
can you come to the wedding ?
you see everything is all right boys
everything is all right
in the meantime i want you to buck up get down to work
let 's put this thing over with a bang
and above all forget about money
don 't think of it
just forget about it because you won 't get it anyway
UNknown i 'm going down to meet the 4 15
if i never come back you UNknown l know i 'm still waiting for the train
you can depend upon me sir
that 's fine
and think of me UNknown
you bet i will
all right sir
i 'm not worried about a hotel clerk
no but i UNknown l bet you 'r e worried about the potter millions
you generally could use money in the old days
oh lay off that stuff
you know marrying polly is the only way for you to square your debts
i can take care of myself
i doubt it
what do you mean ?
have you ever seen that diamond necklace of mrs potter 's ?
you bet i have
her room and my room are right next to each other
hers is 318 ; mine 320
the door between is unlocked
the key is always in her bag
that 's what you UNknown e got to get
it 's a large order but maybe it can be done
suppose i invite mrs potter and polly to take supper with me tonight ?
what then ?
now you 'r e talking
that sounds more like old times
and now i will try and get rid of bob adams for you
look this is cocoanut manor
you know that hill ?
what a question
it 's cunning all right
but that 's why there hasn 't been any development here
couldn 't it be cut down ?
john w UNknown was here to see it last month
you know UNknown practically built palm beach and miami but he said he wouldn 't touch this
now when a man like that passes a place up no one wants it
do you know anything about architecture ?
no but i 'd love to learn
well i made a drawing of the whole place showing the hills
it 's a built up scheme without cutting down the hill or having it get in the way
i made the hill fit in with the UNknown scheme
i sent UNknown a copy last week and his secretary wrote me a nice note saying they were studying my plans
that 's thrilling
say i may be an architect yet
if he only does i 'm sure it will be the most beautiful place in the world
it would be if you lived there
look see what i UNknown e written ?
heaven for polly and me
that looks great
any day now
let 's make it come true
will be a love nest
the practical kind
all that i seem to do
when will i realize
will be a love nest
the practical kind
i am looking
i wonder who it can be
let 's find out
she generally is and she generally finds me
you know mother
i 'd like to hear the rest of it sometime
well miracles do happen
but only for a little while mother
why a daughter of mine should fool around with a hotel clerk when she has the opportunity of marrying one of the boston yates is more than i can understand
oh who cares about the boston yates ?
anyway bob isn 't a clerk
he 's an architect
one who clerks polly is a clerk and that settles it
and i want you to remember that no potter has ever been involved in a single scandal
how about uncle dick ?
polly it 's a well known fact that your uncle was drunk at the time
you ought to cut out drinking so much coffee
i 'm sorry sir
yes it didn 't hit me
that 's the only luck i had with it
mr hammer i think i know what 's wrong with the hotel
i think i know too
you 'r e fired
maybe the season hasn 't started yet
maybe the hotel hasn 't opened yet
don 't worry mr hammer
in a few weeks you UNknown l be cleaning up
yes and making the beds
go on get out of here
i can handle this rush myself
600 rooms in the hotel and you have to sleep here
how do you do mr hammer ?
why don 't you whistle at the crossing ?
you 'r e just the woman i 'm looking for
now whether you like it or not i 'm gonna tell you about florida real estate
it 's the first time it 's ever been mentioned down here today
i 'm sorry but
do you know that this is the biggest development since sophie tucker ?
do you know that florida is the show spot of america and cocoanut beach is the black spot of florida ?
you told me about this yesterday
i know but i left out a comma
you must come over
if you don 't like UNknown we can play contract
here it is
1 600 miles as the crow flies 1 800 as the UNknown
there you are cocoanut manor UNknown the american sewer and the florida sucker
why it 's the most exclusive residential district in florida
nobody lives there
our motto is cocoanut beach no snow no ice and no business
do you know that florida is the greatest state in the union ?
is it ?
take all the alligator pears and keep UNknown m
see if i care
haven 't the slightest idea
that 's because you UNknown e never been an alligator and don 't let it happen again
do you know that it sometimes requires years to bring the pear and the alligator together ?
they don 't like each other
i don 't think i do
all they can get a hold of
florida feeds the nation but nobody feeds me and that 's what i wanna talk to you about
i don 't mean anything personal
but here is the ideal cattle raising section
we have UNknown UNknown and UNknown
mr hammer will you let me say something please ?
i hardly think so and there 's something else i wanna bring to your mind
where will you be when you 'r e 65 ?
that 's only about three months from now
if i were to buy i should prefer someplace like palm beach
palm beach ?
the slums of tomorrow ?
do you know that the population of cocoanut beach has doubled in the past week ?
has it ?
i 'm sorry but i 'm afraid i must be going
aw now don 't go
before you go let me show you a sample of our sewer pipe we 'r e gonna lay
look at it
now this is the eight inch pipe
but of course all property owners will be allowed to vote on the size of their pipe
in case of a tie it goes to the supreme court and i can give you a little inside information in advance
the chief justice is crazy about this type of sewer
here put it in your pocket
i UNknown l see you later

i 'm the proprietor of this hotel and i have a passkey to every room in it
you know they passkey down the UNknown
won 't you uh lie down ?
aw if we could find a little bungalow eh ?
of course i know we could find one but maybe the people wouldn 't get out
but if we could find a nice little empty bungalow just for me and you where we could bill and cow
no where we could bull and cow
do you know what you 'r e trying to say ?
yes it 's not what i 'm thinking of
what i meant was if we had a nice little bungalow and you was inside and i was outside trying to get in or inside trying to get out
no i was in
i don 't think i understand
i mean your eyes your eyes they shine like the pants of a blue serge suit
that 's on the pants
what i meant was if we had a nice bungalow and i came home from work and you were standing by the gate
no you came home from work and i was standing by the gate
that 's more like it
and we came down the path and we went inside and the shades were drawn and the lights were low and uh then uh
are you sure your husband 's dead ?
you know a yes like that was once responsible for me jumping out of a window
and i 'm not the jumper i used to be
you did once
i love you
what in the world is the matter with you ?
oh i 'm not myself tonight
i don 't know who i am
one false move and i 'm yours
i love you
i might but i 'd keep my mouth shut
i UNknown l not stay here any longer and be insulted this way
no don 't go away and leave me here alone
you stay here and i UNknown l go away
i don 't know what to say
say that you UNknown l be truly mine or truly yours or yours truly
don 't you know that i 'm
will you keep your hands to yourself !
just think tonight tonight when the moon is sneaking around the clouds i UNknown l be sneaking around you
i UNknown l meet you tonight under the moon
oh i can see you now you and the moon
you wear a necktie so i UNknown l know you
send up some ice water right away
oh that 's fine
how do you mean ?
there 's bound to be trouble when she misses the necklace
i should say not
hide it ?
yes but where ?
a hollow tree stump about a mile from here
will that do ?
it 's cocoanut manor
i 'm not so sure harvey
here i UNknown l show you
now you you go right out cocoanut road
then there 's UNknown road like this but instead you take the granada road
suddenly you come to a clearing with a fringe of trees around it
that 's cocoanut manor where the stump is
it 's about 20 feet from the edge of the clearing
that 's where you put the jewels
you can 't miss it
now you take the necklace right out there see ?
i UNknown e got to go back downstairs or mrs potter will be suspicious
and be careful
everything 's going along UNknown now
do you remember me ?
the prince of wales ?
why yes of course i do
did he go ?
this hotel not only has running water it has running guests
mr hammer what are you doing in my room ?
i UNknown l find out about this outfit
well i guess there 's nobody in here
you don 't know where to look
what 's that you said ?
oh this is awful
well everything seems to be all right in here
i 'm not so sure about that
if you wanna keep him up in the room you UNknown l have to keep him in a trap
i can 't catch him
who is he ?
oh that 's your silent partner
well anyhow you wired me about some property
i UNknown e thought it over
now i can let you have three lots watering the front or i can let you have three lots UNknown the water
now these lots cost me 9 000 and i 'm gonna let you have them for 15 because i like you
i no buy nothing
i no got a one cent
how are you gonna pay for your room ?
that 's your lookout
well you see we come here to make money
i read in the paper and it say big boom in florida so we come
we 'r e a couple of big UNknown too
i UNknown l show you how you can make some real money
i 'm going to hold an auction in a little while in cocoanut manor
i say i 'm holding an auction at cocoanut manor
and when the crowd gathers around i want you to mingle with them
don 't pick their pockets just mingle with them
i UNknown l find time for both
well maybe we can cut out the auction
here 's what i mean
if somebody says 100 you say two
if somebody says two you say three
how am i gonna know when they no say nothin ?
well they UNknown l probably notify you
you fool if they don 't say anything you UNknown l hear UNknown m won 't you ?
well maybe i no listen
well don 't tell UNknown m
now then if we 'r e successful in disposing of these lots i UNknown l see that you get a nice commission
and how about some money ?
well you can have your choice
now in arranging these lots of course we use blueprints
you know what a blueprint is huh ?
it 's oysters
i go around by myself
yeah it 's too much
i don 't mean a whole lot
just a little lot with nothing on it
anytime you got a too much you got a whole lot
look i explain it to you
sometimes you no got a enough
sometimes you got a whole lot
sometimes you got a little bit
you no think it 's enough
somebody else maybe think it 's a too much
it 's a whole lot too
now a whole lot is a too much too much is a whole lot
now look this is a map and diagram of the whole cocoanut section

it 's gonna be a cinch explaining the rest of this thing to you i can see that
i catch on quick
here 's cocoanut manor

i want to take this occasion of welcoming you to UNknown
no no i mean in recognition of my many years of service with the railroad you have presented me with these ties
and that of course reminds me of the story of the irishman
it 's so funny
oft in the UNknown night the trembling of a leaf can be heard sighing through the trees
and the babbling brook as it UNknown its way onward babbling and
well i got rid of one
and one like that is worth three ordinary ones
where was i ?
that 's right
UNknown and spring veal showed a firm tone
and eggs were a little touchy on a falling market
well my mother and father talked it over and they finally moved to new york
they took a little house in the bronx
and it was in that little house that abraham lincoln was born much to my father 's surprise
and that boys and girls was the beginning of the lincoln highway
and now friends in view of the fact that miss potter 's engagement is being celebrated here tonight so to speak
i think a few words from her mother would be revolting
i now take great pleasure in presenting to you the well preserved and partially pickled mrs potter
come on now
the old gal is stewed to the eyebrows
and now i want to wish you all a most enjoyable evening
as for myself i 'm sad
i simply can 't go any farther
i UNknown l get off with you
now friends i want to take great pleasure in presenting to you the groom mr yates mr harvey yates
good evening radio fans

what i intended to say
i want you to see my UNknown
i was just going to say that
next spring i 'm gonna get some early UNknown
as i was about to say

i wouldn 't dream of taking up any more of your time
i really wanted to thank you all
well you certainly succeeded
that 's that good gulf gas
don 't do that
i don 't have to

i think i can honestly say this is the happiest moment of my life
look what i have here
it 's a little engagement present just given me by mr yates
he wrote it just now but he wrote another yesterday when a necklace was stolen
they are both in his handwriting
let me read it to you

she will be married to mr robert adams
phyilis will you tell mother !
tell mother !

i live in the center of the largest tea district in java
since you are dealing in tea mr sterling why not make my home your headquarters ?
any big game in java ?
i UNknown e always had a secret ambition to shoot a tiger
if you will honor my house with a visit i shall be happy to arrange a tiger hunt
that would be great
oh you are married ?
i 'd like you to meet my wife
dear i want you to meet prince de UNknown
i 'm sorry but this is very important
i UNknown l be right back
will you have some thing to drink ?
i never drink
my wife loves to dance too
your country has always interested me with its worship of the great god business
the east is a country of the senses warm mysterious like the kiss of a lover
you are like the orchids of your country you have the same cold enchantment
in java the orchids grow wild and their perfume fills the air
and the women of java do they grow wild too ?
not wild but natural
the heat the everlasting heat strips everyone of all pretense
it would be fascinating to learn whether your UNknown is only a pretense
i am furious !
don 't worry mr sterling
i can supply you with hunting equipment
i am afraid of your prince
this gun business gets my goat !
john didn 't you notice anything strange in the prince 's attitude toward me ?
there 's something strange about all foreigners !
and then he took me in his arms and kissed me
i had a terrible nightmare !
java a land of magic beauty cursed with heat relentless heat
but you were just saying you wanted a nice cold drink !
i won 't accept anything from him !
he 's a fine chap what 's the matter with him ?
i just don 't like him !
and i begged you not to accept his invitation !
don 't be unreasonable lillie !
why don 't you like him ?
you know i UNknown e always wanted to shoot a tiger
it 's the heat
he says your beauty is more dazzling than the sun
reminds me of the army !
good lord a double bed !
now mr sterling i will show you your room
your personal maids
i trust madame has enjoyed the evening
what in heaven 's name have you got on ?
you look silly dear take off that junk and go to bed
great eastern company about to bid tea UNknown you are interested
i advise close deals immediately
i UNknown e got to cover six plantations it 's no trip for you !
why can 't you stay here like a sensible woman ?
because i want to be with you
the prince is going with us
i think mrs sterling would enjoy it more if the top were down
you would have the top down !
now i suppose you UNknown l catch cold !
top up now sir
you can 't travel in that condition
you UNknown l have to stay here and we UNknown l come back for you
but dear i don 't want to stay here alone
i just told him if anything happened to mrs sterling i would cut his throat
your husband thought you would be safer if i remained with you
why have you shut yourself away from me all day ?
you were afraid
where is mrs sterling ?
mrs sterling went to her room after supper
i thought you were never coming back !
why are you so excited ?
i was so worried about you

and matches too they mustn 't complain
and a little bottle of champagne
at any rate your last in paris
as the ambassador of UNknown
i cannot any longer permit our military attach to disgrace the name of our illustrious country with his shameless UNknown
your excellency please
you will leave at once for UNknown and report to her majesty the queen in person
but your excellency i 'm sure the stories you UNknown e heard about me are horribly are horribly exaggerated
count renard for one week i made it my business to follow you about personally
i would have taken you to some real places
how dare you
my wife has told me everything
you are to take the first train
i think i had better take the first airplane
you are going by plane monsieur ?
you 'r e not going to take me with you ?
i 'm sorry
think how good i am at making up excuses for you
why i can even imitate your voice on the telephone and pretend you 'r e at home to one lady when you 'r e really having supper with another
and you can tell lies better than anybody i know
but i won 't need you anymore
in fact i will probably be sent to a military prison
but even so you UNknown l need me monsieur
supposing someone you don 't want to see calls at the prison
who 's going to tell them you 'r e not at home ?
i can 't see how anybody could be so anxious to leave this beautiful paris
but monsieur i am a frenchman
and to be a frenchman in paris is nothing because everyone in paris is a frenchman
that 's true
what is the name of your country ?
i can actually tell them the one about the frenchman and the farmer 's daughter
oh please monsieur take me to pennsylvania
go and pack the bags
oh thank you
but i know that i UNknown l miss you
you took a lot of pains in teaching me
why must we say adieu
i UNknown e seen your mild days
and some of your wild days
down where the seine flows
paris your judgment was good enough for me
with you each night meant the thrill of excitement
if i UNknown e been happy then you 'r e to blame
oh paris please stay the same
i UNknown e seen your blonde girls
with beautiful blonde curls
they taught me all that a kiss could be
paris your ladies were good enough for me
if i UNknown e been happy then you 'r e to blame
oh ladies please stay the same
i 'm like my master now i 'm leaving you
he 's sad so am i paris
i UNknown e seen your mild maids
i UNknown e see your wild maids
both shy and UNknown
paris your servants were good enough for me
oh paris please stay the same
ladies and gentlemen on your right you see the royal opera house
and on my left the residence of her majesty queen louise i of UNknown
the construction of the castle was begun under maximilian i in UNknown
and its collection of art treasures is UNknown
the castle represents a value of 110 million
all murmuring man 110 million ?
chattering 110 !
why that isn 't a chicken step !
quiet here !
i 'm so hopeful your majesty rested well
why am i always awakened from my dreams ?
i 'm sure it was a nice dream your majesty
oh it was wonderful
there 's a land of charm that i know
land of sweet romance where i love to go
and its bounds touch my room
in the gloom where the shadows creep
someone i meet there waits for me
someone tender as a lover should be
and i whisper each night
as i close my eyes
dream lover your romance has found me
i 'm held
nobody indiscreet can find us
oh dream lover mine
dream lover your romance has found me
oh my darling i am just longing for a love of my own
nobody indiscreet can find us nobody indiscreet can find us i know
i 'm afraid i can 't
it wasn 't just exactly the sort of dream for a queen
was it the sort of dream for a lady in waiting ?
i hope not
i dreamed that your majesty got married
and you call that a lovely dream ?
why not your majesty ?
we all wish we all hope we all pray
that very soon your majesty will be married
yes your majesty
what do the children learn at school ?
the queen is unmarried still
what do the papers write about ?
is the queen to marry ?
what does my parliament debate ?
when shall the queen marry ?
and from my ministers
but your majesty it is not the same conductor
this is a new one
where 's the old one ?
he is being married today
for what your majesty ?
for my husband
you 'r e always talking about it
we have no one to suggest your majesty
we have given the matter up
well uh all clearing throats
louise and that 's final admiral
i certainly don 't need any help from the navy
yes your majesty
if marrying you were to make a man a king that would be different
but your majesty 's husband would be simply prince consort
after all what is a prince consort ?
he is a gentleman with a thousand duties and no rights
he has nothing to say nothing to do
well i wouldn 't say that
my face isn 't actually painful to look at
my complexion 's quite good
and in case you 'r e too serious minded to notice such things
let me inform you my legs are perfect
there 's only one other leg like that in the whole of UNknown
and that 's it
whispering how do you think i should behave ?
should i be humble proud UNknown ?
say as little as possible
i don 't think your french accent will please her majesty
strong french accent is it still very notice able ?
chuckles i UNknown l tell you
once in paris i had an awful cold
i went to see a great french doctor to cure it
i rang the bell
i had lost my cold but i had a terrific french accent
count alfred renard
ordered home for an audience with your majesty
you UNknown l have to wait
yes your majesty
count alfred renard
ordered home for an audience with your majesty
didn 't i tell you to wait ?
yes your majesty
no your majesty
yes your majesty
i think it 's serious
yes your majesty
yes your majesty
chuckles yes !
an awful punishment
a beard your majesty ?
you UNknown l have to be serious in a beard
and am i to be permitted to attend your majesty after the beard is grown ?
then i fear your majesty will regret the order
i look terrible in a beard
but i don 't
ah it came out all red and UNknown
and chuckles that 's saying a great deal
well then don 't grow it
no your majesty
i UNknown e got to punish you
i would say this
you shall not return to paris
in the palace
and you call that a punishment ?
chuckles you 'r e the most impudent man i UNknown e ever met
you seem to forget you 'r e talking to your queen
at 8 00 ?
you really can 't be too severe when my regret is so sincere
could i depend on you
to make you think more kindly
let me obey you blindly
you mean you 'd really do
anything to please the queen
everything to please the queen
morning noon and night
you want me good then i UNknown l be good
you want me bad then i UNknown l be bad
i mean i could be both
if you demand me
perhaps you 'd like my arms instead
i UNknown e lost my head the moment i saw you smile
remember you 'r e on trial
will you do as i advise
madame you will be surprised you mean
anything to please the queen
anything to please the queen
everything to please the queen
morning noon and night
you want me cold then i UNknown l be cold
you want me bold then i UNknown l be bold
i UNknown l be bold or cold or hot
as you demand me
a good night watchman i will be chuckles
i UNknown e learned that duty in paris you leave it to me
you 'd better wait and see we shall find how good you are
i UNknown e had no complaints so far
you mean anything to please the queen
anything to please the queen
perhaps you didn 't quite follow me count
you 'r e invited for dinner not for tea
i followed your majesty perfectly
morning noon and night i 'm yours to command
no lady will telephone
i know it
i am the farmer 's daughter
is this your animal ?
so that 's your master
because the king 's away
there is no king
and do you think her majesty is serious ?
why how can you doubt it ?
the first time she sees him she invites him to dine with her alone
and if it goes on at this rate then we 'r e entitled to the highest hopes
chattering shh !
at each other ?
and how she laughs
the lackey is bringing in champagne
now they are clinking glasses
how do you know that he does ?
you can 't hear anything
what else could he say ?
what does it mean ?
the queen is warm
she opens the door
heaven save the queen !
you know count this is the first time i UNknown e ever dined with a man alone
and this is the first time i have ever
these dinners in paris were charming ?
and the ladies ?
a mere woman
what would you do ?
if she were like like ?
if she were like
they couldn 't last with you
none of them could ever hold me fast
in the way you do
yet their memories seem to cling to me
something from each one you bring to me
eyes of UNknown
no other arms but yours could ever hold me
lips of lucille
those other charms
no other arms but yours could ever hold me
i UNknown e gone my lonely way
but i have a love that 's all my own
to bestow someday
all the charms you love
combined in me
no other arms but yours could ever hold me
lips of lucille
your love parade my love parade
i 'm not a king
oh but you UNknown l be a sensation
everyone will applaud when you enter the throne room
now how do i look ?
i don 't like that medal
chuckles what 's the matter with it ?
the man looks cross eyed
cross eyed ?
chuckles oh no
still looks cross eyed
i UNknown e had bad luck
to me it 's even worse than whistling
is it still your majesty 's wish to select prince alfred as your majesty 's husband ?
yes i do
and to be UNknown
yes i do
speaking foreign language
he says man is man and woman is woman
and that to change that causes trouble
he does not see how any man could stand being a wife
and therefore he hopes this will be a most unhappy marriage
for heaven 's sake
tell him this is a love match and will be the happiest marriage in the world
speaking foreign language
stopped at once
i command it
our bridal music
let 's get married too
make it a double wedding
i 'm thrilled !
perhaps we 'd better wait with our marriage and see how they get on first
but there 's no chance of their marriage going wrong
why it even started wrong
what does that lady think she 's marrying a trained poodle ?
she is not a lady
she is a queen
he 's a gentleman
they can 't afford to
that 's just the trouble
they can 't let off steam with a good old row like you or i
that 's true
we can act natural and nobody will care
we can eat chicken with our fingers
look at the names i can call you
look at the things i can throw at you
oh it 's wonderful being common
let 's get together and cuddle up right here
bear in mind i 'm refined
and i 'm not that way inclined
where 's your proper pride
why be so dignified
s 'm UNknown improper but oh it 's nice
let 's be common
s 'a beautiful feeling and thrills me through
let 's be common and do it again
i UNknown l surely smother
oh let me go sir this isn 't right
oh darling mother
grip my neck grab my hand
s 'm UNknown improper but oh it 's grand
let 's be common
so let 's be common
and do it again
s UNknown UNknown we UNknown l be black and blue
let 's be common
you UNknown l bruise me till i 'm UNknown
so let 's be rough you know how
s 'n o use struggling too late now
so let 's be common
and do it again
ladies and gentlemen four weeks ago today our illustrious queen was married
the desire of her subjects to celebrate this date is readily understood
but in consideration of the royal honeymoon
and obey the trumpets call
let your queen be heard by all
my heart is UNknown with your loyalty
for you we stand or fall
singing a song of motherland
living to serve no other land
who could be true as the grenadiers chorus grenadiers
steady and strong marching along
heroes who scorn all fear
royal men the royal grenadiers
louise holding note chorus grenadiers
steady and strong marching along
singing a song of motherland
living to serve no other land
who could be true as the grenadiers
grenadiers steady and strong marching along
heroes who scorn all fears
royal men the royal grenadiers
left right left right left right left right
i have nothing to get up for
well what a charming reception
i spend all morning UNknown the household guards distributing medals and now on my way to an audience with the prime minister
i steal away to have a look at my husband and and
he doesn 't even say good morning to me
what can i do now ?
i have already shaved
there 's nothing left
all i 'm waiting for now is to have you tell me i 'm neglecting you
do you realize that not once since we UNknown e been married have i left you alone at night ?
and i never will
and after this foreign loan is arranged
i 'm going to take you to vienna and buy you a lot of nice new uniforms
that 's it
that 's the opinion you have of me is it ?
oh don 't be silly alfred
oh i 'm sick of being treated as if i were a sort of UNknown
you 'r e in a horrible mood today
am i ?
but please do not interfere with my coughing
i cough when i want to
at last i UNknown e found something to do
i will repair this today
where is my breakfast ?
may i remind your highness that her majesty the queen has not as yet appeared
i want my breakfast
her majesty will not appear for breakfast this morning
breakfast for his highness
no your highness
just look at me
nobody seems to take me seriously
the days mean nothing at all
and when the shadows fall
the moon is only wasting time on me
to hug and hold
i UNknown e loads of love
that could be told
i UNknown e a world of time
that 's all my own
they say that you go silly if you spend it alone
i 'm telling the truth i 'm just wasting my youth
UNknown UNknown nobody 's using it now no no no no
nobody 's using it now
there 's a bridal suite
in gold and blue
i UNknown e learned to wear pajamas too
what 's the use of wearing them now
i UNknown e sown wild oats
i have indeed
for years and for years i UNknown e had great ideas
but nobody 's using them now no no no no
nobody 's using them now
i have a big settee with patent springs
i UNknown e some pleasing ways and chuckles other things
i 'm a family man who 's out of sorts
i 'm just a loving papa to a great lot of thoughts
i blush to admit i UNknown e still plenty of it
but nobody 's using it now no no no no
nobody 's using it now UNknown UNknown
minister yes indeed your majesty
have the UNknown been focused on the entrance to the opera house ?
oh yes your majesty
the crowd will cheer and press forward with such enthusiasm that it can be kept in check only by the most heroic efforts of the police
and has all this been well rehearsed ?
oh yes your majesty
they all know their parts perfectly
for two minutes we will have silent homage
your majesty and the prince consort will reward your loyal subjects with happy smiles
you are both in the best of humor
in the best of humor ?
oh yes your majesty
well coughs your majesty i i
well you 'd better tell him to be safe
yes your majesty
and if the prince consort does not smile in joy it will mean disaster
and if he sees any UNknown between you he UNknown l report it to afghanistan
well let him
UNknown hears it too
and what is talked of in persia spreads all over turkey
and when anything is known in turkey the UNknown get onto it immediately
and you know how many UNknown go to america
so if wall street hears of a UNknown in the matrimonial happiness of your majesty it will stop all credits and we do not get the loan
and without that loan we are broke
ministers broke !
prince alfred what are you permitting yourself ?
i permit myself to make the following suggestion
we do not need a loan
we have enough natural resources
there is my plan for the national budget
the country can be saved without a loan
not even when they are good ?
not even then
yes your highness
prince alfred you may leave the room
and in case i don 't feel like UNknown with your majesty 's wish ?
this is not my wish
it is my command
i would laugh
you don 't say is it true
think of that who 's to blame
and he asked for garlic in his soup at dinner so i heard
good for you not at all
i 'm for that let it go
well here i am still single may my children stay the same
drink to that here 's to you
poor old prince is that so
don 't you dare to say a word against the queen
the queen is always right
the queen is just a woman and she 's just as mean
say that again we UNknown l fight
don 't forget she has a husband don 't forget she is the boss
and her majesty can run him out of town
the prince is right the queen is right simultaneously the prince is right the queen is right
that 's enough from you sit down
don 't you dare to say a word against the queen
the queen is always right
the queen is just a woman and she 's just as mean
say that again we UNknown l fight
don 't forget she 's got a husband don 't forget she is the boss
and her majesty can run him out of town
the prince is right the queen is right

the prince is right the queen is right
the prince is right the queen is right
the prince is right the queen is right
the prince is right the queen is right
the prince is right the queen is right
the prince is right the queen is right
that 's enough from you sit down
you can tell him my patience is exhausted
if he won 't come here voluntarily i UNknown l have him brought here even if i have to send soldiers
yes your majesty
what does it mean ?
it means i 'm dressed for traveling
i 'm going to paris
you go change at once
you 'r e going to the opera with me
only with soldiers and handcuffed
alfred you know very well how much depends on this my name my position my reputation as queen
if you fail me tonight all will be over between us
it is already over and forever
you thought you could order the former military attach around and command the husband
but you forgot one thing madame that first i am a man
i know that alfred
good bye madame
only with soldiers and handcuffed
i 'm held in your spell crying knowing so well
dreams never tell sobbing
grenadiers steady and strong marching along
living to serve no other land
who could be true as the grenadiers
heroes who scorn all fears
royal men the royal grenadiers
left right left right left right left right
sing out audience chattering laughing
all right good bye
don 't ask me
since you beg me so lovingly
i UNknown l be generous
i UNknown l stay
that 's why you came here
but tomorrow i 'm leaving for paris
and as soon as this loan of yours is signed
i will file papers for divorce
if you don 't treat me nicely i UNknown l go right home
you 'r e a queen
you must behave
but you can 't
speaking foreign language huh ?
when we get married let 's be common and only have one room between us
why even one room between us ?
wherever you go i UNknown l follow you
whimpers you can 't get rid of me
well there is no use for me to leave then
i suppose so too
and you must be punished
louise i don 't want a divorce
i love you too much for that
no no no no no
but i 'd say louise
you can 't order me around any longer
not only of the affairs of state
not only in the department of the navy but also here at home
and my first command would be
louise don 't dare to leave this room
you shall stay here
and you call that a punishment ?
yes my king
and matches too they mustn 't complain
and a little bottle of champagne
at any rate your last in paris
as the ambassador of UNknown
i cannot any longer permit our military attach to disgrace the name of our illustrious country with his shameless UNknown
your excellency please
you will leave at once for UNknown and report to her majesty the queen in person
but your excellency i 'm sure the stories you UNknown e heard about me are horribly are horribly exaggerated

think how good i am at making up excuses for you
why i can even imitate your voice on the telephone and pretend you 'r e at home to one lady when you 'r e really having supper with another
and you can tell lies better than anybody i know
but i won 't need you anymore
in fact i will probably be sent to a military prison
but even so you UNknown l need me monsieur
supposing someone you don 't want to see calls at the prison
who 's going to tell them you 'r e not at home ?
i can 't see how anybody could be so anxious to leave this beautiful paris
but monsieur i am a frenchman
and to be a frenchman in paris is nothing because everyone in paris is a frenchman
that 's true
what is the name of your country ?
i can actually tell them the one about the frenchman and the farmer 's daughter
oh please monsieur take me to pennsylvania
go and pack the bags
oh thank you
but i know that i UNknown l miss you
you took a lot of pains in teaching me
why must we say adieu
i UNknown e seen your mild days
and some of your wild days
down where the seine flows
paris your judgment was good enough for me
with you each night meant the thrill of excitement
if i UNknown e been happy then you 'r e to blame
oh paris please stay the same
i UNknown e seen your blonde girls
with beautiful blonde curls
they taught me all that a kiss could be
paris your ladies were good enough for me
if i UNknown e been happy then you 'r e to blame
oh ladies please stay the same
i 'm like my master now i 'm leaving you
he 's sad so am i paris
i UNknown e seen your mild maids
i UNknown e see your wild maids
both shy and UNknown
paris your servants were good enough for me
oh paris please stay the same
ladies and gentlemen on your right you see the royal opera house
and on my left the residence of her majesty queen louise i of UNknown
the construction of the castle was begun under maximilian i in UNknown
and its collection of art treasures is UNknown
the castle represents a value of 110 million
all murmuring man 110 million ?
chattering 110 !
why that isn 't a chicken step !
quiet here !
i 'm so hopeful your majesty rested well
why am i always awakened from my dreams ?
i 'm sure it was a nice dream your majesty
oh it was wonderful
there 's a land of charm that i know
land of sweet romance where i love to go
and its bounds touch my room
in the gloom where the shadows creep
someone i meet there waits for me
someone tender as a lover should be
and i whisper each night
as i close my eyes
dream lover your romance has found me
i 'm held
nobody indiscreet can find us
oh dream lover mine
dream lover your romance has found me
oh my darling i am just longing for a love of my own
nobody indiscreet can find us nobody indiscreet can find us i know
i 'm afraid i can 't
it wasn 't just exactly the sort of dream for a queen
was it the sort of dream for a lady in waiting ?
i hope not
i dreamed that your majesty got married
and you call that a lovely dream ?
why not your majesty ?
we all wish we all hope we all pray
that very soon your majesty will be married
yes your majesty
what do the children learn at school ?
the queen is unmarried still
what do the papers write about ?
is the queen to marry ?
what does my parliament debate ?
when shall the queen marry ?
and from my ministers
but your majesty it is not the same conductor
this is a new one
where 's the old one ?
he is being married today
for what your majesty ?
for my husband
you 'r e always talking about it
we have no one to suggest your majesty
we have given the matter up
well uh all clearing throats
louise and that 's final admiral
i certainly don 't need any help from the navy
yes your majesty
if marrying you were to make a man a king that would be different
but your majesty 's husband would be simply prince consort
after all what is a prince consort ?
he is a gentleman with a thousand duties and no rights
he has nothing to say nothing to do
well i wouldn 't say that
my face isn 't actually painful to look at
my complexion 's quite good
and in case you 'r e too serious minded to notice such things
let me inform you my legs are perfect
there 's only one other leg like that in the whole of UNknown
and that 's it
whispering how do you think i should behave ?
should i be humble proud UNknown ?
say as little as possible
i don 't think your french accent will please her majesty
strong french accent is it still very notice able ?
chuckles i UNknown l tell you
once in paris i had an awful cold
i went to see a great french doctor to cure it
i rang the bell
i had lost my cold but i had a terrific french accent
count alfred renard
ordered home for an audience with your majesty
you UNknown l have to wait
yes your majesty
count alfred renard
ordered home for an audience with your majesty
didn 't i tell you to wait ?
yes your majesty
no your majesty
yes your majesty
i think it 's serious
yes your majesty
yes your majesty
chuckles yes !
an awful punishment
a beard your majesty ?
you UNknown l have to be serious in a beard
and am i to be permitted to attend your majesty after the beard is grown ?
then i fear your majesty will regret the order
i look terrible in a beard
but i don 't
ah it came out all red and UNknown
and chuckles that 's saying a great deal
well then don 't grow it
no your majesty
i UNknown e got to punish you
i would say this
you shall not return to paris
in the palace
and you call that a punishment ?
chuckles you 'r e the most impudent man i UNknown e ever met
you seem to forget you 'r e talking to your queen
at 8 00 ?
you really can 't be too severe when my regret is so sincere
could i depend on you
to make you think more kindly
let me obey you blindly
you mean you 'd really do
anything to please the queen
everything to please the queen
morning noon and night
you want me good then i UNknown l be good
you want me bad then i UNknown l be bad
i mean i could be both
if you demand me
perhaps you 'd like my arms instead
i UNknown e lost my head the moment i saw you smile
remember you 'r e on trial
will you do as i advise
madame you will be surprised you mean
anything to please the queen
anything to please the queen
everything to please the queen
morning noon and night
you want me cold then i UNknown l be cold
you want me bold then i UNknown l be bold
i UNknown l be bold or cold or hot
as you demand me
a good night watchman i will be chuckles
i UNknown e learned that duty in paris you leave it to me
you 'd better wait and see we shall find how good you are
i UNknown e had no complaints so far
you mean anything to please the queen
anything to please the queen
perhaps you didn 't quite follow me count
you 'r e invited for dinner not for tea
i followed your majesty perfectly
morning noon and night i 'm yours to command
no lady will telephone
i know it
i am the farmer 's daughter
is this your animal ?
so that 's your master
because the king 's away
there is no king
and do you think her majesty is serious ?
why how can you doubt it ?
the first time she sees him she invites him to dine with her alone
and if it goes on at this rate then we 'r e entitled to the highest hopes
chattering shh !
at each other ?
and how she laughs
the lackey is bringing in champagne
now they are clinking glasses
how do you know that he does ?
you can 't hear anything
what else could he say ?
what does it mean ?
the queen is warm
she opens the door
heaven save the queen !
you know count this is the first time i UNknown e ever dined with a man alone
and this is the first time i have ever
these dinners in paris were charming ?
and the ladies ?
a mere woman
what would you do ?
if she were like like ?
if she were like
they couldn 't last with you
none of them could ever hold me fast
in the way you do
yet their memories seem to cling to me
something from each one you bring to me
eyes of UNknown
no other arms but yours could ever hold me
lips of lucille
those other charms
no other arms but yours could ever hold me
i UNknown e gone my lonely way
but i have a love that 's all my own
to bestow someday
all the charms you love
combined in me
no other arms but yours could ever hold me
lips of lucille
your love parade my love parade
i 'm not a king
oh but you UNknown l be a sensation
everyone will applaud when you enter the throne room
now how do i look ?
i don 't like that medal
chuckles what 's the matter with it ?
the man looks cross eyed
cross eyed ?
chuckles oh no
still looks cross eyed
i UNknown e had bad luck
to me it 's even worse than whistling
is it still your majesty 's wish to select prince alfred as your majesty 's husband ?
yes i do
and to be UNknown
yes i do
speaking foreign language
he says man is man and woman is woman
and that to change that causes trouble
he does not see how any man could stand being a wife
and therefore he hopes this will be a most unhappy marriage
for heaven 's sake
tell him this is a love match and will be the happiest marriage in the world
speaking foreign language
stopped at once
i command it
our bridal music
let 's get married too
make it a double wedding
i 'm thrilled !
perhaps we 'd better wait with our marriage and see how they get on first
but there 's no chance of their marriage going wrong
why it even started wrong
what does that lady think she 's marrying a trained poodle ?
she is not a lady
she is a queen
he 's a gentleman
they can 't afford to
that 's just the trouble
they can 't let off steam with a good old row like you or i
that 's true
we can act natural and nobody will care
we can eat chicken with our fingers
look at the names i can call you
look at the things i can throw at you
oh it 's wonderful being common
let 's get together and cuddle up right here
bear in mind i 'm refined
and i 'm not that way inclined
where 's your proper pride
why be so dignified
s 'm UNknown improper but oh it 's nice
let 's be common
s 'a beautiful feeling and thrills me through
let 's be common and do it again
i UNknown l surely smother
oh let me go sir this isn 't right
oh darling mother
grip my neck grab my hand
s 'm UNknown improper but oh it 's grand
let 's be common
so let 's be common
and do it again
s UNknown UNknown we UNknown l be black and blue
let 's be common
you UNknown l bruise me till i 'm UNknown
so let 's be rough you know how
s 'n o use struggling too late now
so let 's be common
and do it again
ladies and gentlemen four weeks ago today our illustrious queen was married
the desire of her subjects to celebrate this date is readily understood
but in consideration of the royal honeymoon
and obey the trumpets call
let your queen be heard by all
my heart is UNknown with your loyalty
for you we stand or fall
singing a song of motherland
living to serve no other land
who could be true as the grenadiers chorus grenadiers
steady and strong marching along
heroes who scorn all fear
royal men the royal grenadiers
louise holding note chorus grenadiers
steady and strong marching along
singing a song of motherland
living to serve no other land
who could be true as the grenadiers
grenadiers steady and strong marching along
heroes who scorn all fears
royal men the royal grenadiers
left right left right left right left right
i have nothing to get up for
well what a charming reception
i spend all morning UNknown the household guards distributing medals and now on my way to an audience with the prime minister
i steal away to have a look at my husband and and
he doesn 't even say good morning to me
what can i do now ?
i have already shaved
there 's nothing left
all i 'm waiting for now is to have you tell me i 'm neglecting you
do you realize that not once since we UNknown e been married have i left you alone at night ?
and i never will
and after this foreign loan is arranged
i 'm going to take you to vienna and buy you a lot of nice new uniforms
that 's it
that 's the opinion you have of me is it ?
oh don 't be silly alfred
oh i 'm sick of being treated as if i were a sort of UNknown
you 'r e in a horrible mood today
am i ?
but please do not interfere with my coughing
i cough when i want to
at last i UNknown e found something to do
i will repair this today
where is my breakfast ?
may i remind your highness that her majesty the queen has not as yet appeared
i want my breakfast
her majesty will not appear for breakfast this morning
breakfast for his highness
no your highness
just look at me
nobody seems to take me seriously
the days mean nothing at all
and when the shadows fall
the moon is only wasting time on me
to hug and hold
i UNknown e loads of love
that could be told
i UNknown e a world of time
that 's all my own
they say that you go silly if you spend it alone
i 'm telling the truth i 'm just wasting my youth
UNknown UNknown nobody 's using it now no no no no
nobody 's using it now
there 's a bridal suite
in gold and blue
i UNknown e learned to wear pajamas too
what 's the use of wearing them now
i UNknown e sown wild oats
i have indeed
for years and for years i UNknown e had great ideas
but nobody 's using them now no no no no
nobody 's using them now
i have a big settee with patent springs
i UNknown e some pleasing ways and chuckles other things
i 'm a family man who 's out of sorts
i 'm just a loving papa to a great lot of thoughts
i blush to admit i UNknown e still plenty of it
but nobody 's using it now no no no no
nobody 's using it now UNknown UNknown
minister yes indeed your majesty
have the UNknown been focused on the entrance to the opera house ?
oh yes your majesty
the crowd will cheer and press forward with such enthusiasm that it can be kept in check only by the most heroic efforts of the police
and has all this been well rehearsed ?
oh yes your majesty
they all know their parts perfectly
for two minutes we will have silent homage
your majesty and the prince consort will reward your loyal subjects with happy smiles
you are both in the best of humor
in the best of humor ?
oh yes your majesty
well coughs your majesty i i
well you 'd better tell him to be safe
yes your majesty
and if the prince consort does not smile in joy it will mean disaster
and if he sees any UNknown between you he UNknown l report it to afghanistan
well let him
UNknown hears it too
and what is talked of in persia spreads all over turkey
and when anything is known in turkey the UNknown get onto it immediately
and you know how many UNknown go to america
so if wall street hears of a UNknown in the matrimonial happiness of your majesty it will stop all credits and we do not get the loan
and without that loan we are broke
ministers broke !
prince alfred what are you permitting yourself ?
i permit myself to make the following suggestion
we do not need a loan
we have enough natural resources
there is my plan for the national budget
the country can be saved without a loan
not even when they are good ?
not even then
yes your highness
prince alfred you may leave the room
and in case i don 't feel like UNknown with your majesty 's wish ?
this is not my wish
it is my command
i would laugh
you don 't say is it true
think of that who 's to blame
and he asked for garlic in his soup at dinner so i heard
good for you not at all
i 'm for that let it go
well here i am still single may my children stay the same
drink to that here 's to you
poor old prince is that so
don 't you dare to say a word against the queen
the queen is always right
the queen is just a woman and she 's just as mean
say that again we UNknown l fight
don 't forget she has a husband don 't forget she is the boss
and her majesty can run him out of town
the prince is right the queen is right simultaneously the prince is right the queen is right
that 's enough from you sit down
don 't you dare to say a word against the queen
the queen is always right
the queen is just a woman and she 's just as mean
say that again we UNknown l fight
don 't forget she 's got a husband don 't forget she is the boss
and her majesty can run him out of town
the prince is right the queen is right
the prince is right the queen is right
the prince is right the queen is right
the prince is right the queen is right
the prince is right the queen is right
the prince is right the queen is right
the prince is right the queen is right
the prince is right the queen is right
that 's enough from you sit down
you can tell him my patience is exhausted
if he won 't come here voluntarily i UNknown l have him brought here even if i have to send soldiers
yes your majesty
what does it mean ?
it means i 'm dressed for traveling
i 'm going to paris
you go change at once
you 'r e going to the opera with me
only with soldiers and handcuffed
alfred you know very well how much depends on this my name my position my reputation as queen
if you fail me tonight all will be over between us
it is already over and forever
you thought you could order the former military attach around and command the husband
but you forgot one thing madame that first i am a man
i know that alfred
good bye madame
only with soldiers and handcuffed
i 'm held in your spell crying knowing so well
dreams never tell sobbing
grenadiers steady and strong marching along
living to serve no other land
who could be true as the grenadiers
heroes who scorn all fears
royal men the royal grenadiers
left right left right left right left right
sing out audience chattering laughing
all right good bye
don 't ask me
since you beg me so lovingly
i UNknown l be generous
i UNknown l stay
that 's why you came here
but tomorrow i 'm leaving for paris
and as soon as this loan of yours is signed
i will file papers for divorce
if you don 't treat me nicely i UNknown l go right home
you 'r e a queen
you must behave
but you can 't
speaking foreign language huh ?
when we get married let 's be common and only have one room between us
why even one room between us ?
wherever you go i UNknown l follow you
whimpers you can 't get rid of me
well there is no use for me to leave then
i suppose so too
and you must be punished
louise i don 't want a divorce
i love you too much for that
no no no no no
but i 'd say louise
you can 't order me around any longer
not only of the affairs of state
not only in the department of the navy but also here at home
and my first command would be
louise don 't dare to leave this room
you shall stay here
and you call that a punishment ?
yes my king
and matches too they mustn 't complain
and a little bottle of champagne
at any rate your last in paris
as the ambassador of UNknown
i cannot any longer permit our military attach to disgrace the name of our illustrious country with his shameless UNknown
your excellency please
you will leave at once for UNknown and report to her majesty the queen in person
but your excellency i 'm sure the stories you UNknown e heard about me are horribly are horribly exaggerated
count renard for one week i made it my business to follow you about personally
i would have taken you to some real places
how dare you
my wife has told me everything
you are to take the first train
i think i had better take the first airplane
you are going by plane monsieur ?
you 'r e not going to take me with you ?
i 'm sorry
think how good i am at making up excuses for you
why i can even imitate your voice on the telephone and pretend you 'r e at home to one lady when you 'r e really having supper with another
and you can tell lies better than anybody i know
but i won 't need you anymore
in fact i will probably be sent to a military prison
but even so you UNknown l need me monsieur
supposing someone you don 't want to see calls at the prison
who 's going to tell them you 'r e not at home ?
i can 't see how anybody could be so anxious to leave this beautiful paris
but monsieur i am a frenchman
and to be a frenchman in paris is nothing because everyone in paris is a frenchman
that 's true
what is the name of your country ?
i can actually tell them the one about the frenchman and the farmer 's daughter
oh please monsieur take me to pennsylvania
go and pack the bags
oh thank you
but i know that i UNknown l miss you
you took a lot of pains in teaching me
why must we say adieu

i have nothing to get up for

i spend all morning UNknown the household guards distributing medals and now on my way to an audience with the prime minister
i steal away to have a look at my husband and and
he doesn 't even say good morning to me
what can i do now ?
i have already shaved
there 's nothing left
all i 'm waiting for now is to have you tell me i 'm neglecting you
do you realize that not once since we UNknown e been married have i left you alone at night ?
and i never will
and after this foreign loan is arranged
i 'm going to take you to vienna and buy you a lot of nice new uniforms

may i remind your highness that her majesty the queen has not as yet appeared
i want my breakfast
her majesty will not appear for breakfast this morning
breakfast for his highness
no your highness
just look at me
nobody seems to take me seriously
the days mean nothing at all
and when the shadows fall
the moon is only wasting time on me
to hug and hold
i UNknown e loads of love
that could be told
i UNknown e a world of time
that 's all my own
they say that you go silly if you spend it alone
i 'm telling the truth i 'm just wasting my youth
UNknown UNknown nobody 's using it now no no no no
nobody 's using it now
there 's a bridal suite
in gold and blue
i UNknown e learned to wear pajamas too
what 's the use of wearing them now
i UNknown e sown wild oats
i have indeed
for years and for years i UNknown e had great ideas
but nobody 's using them now no no no no
nobody 's using them now
i have a big settee with patent springs
i UNknown e some pleasing ways and other things
i 'm a family man who 's out of sorts
i 'm just a loving papa to a great lot of thoughts
i blush to admit i UNknown e still plenty of it
but nobody 's using it now no no no no
nobody 's using it now UNknown UNknown
your majesty is still the biggest drawing card in the country
yes indeed your majesty
oh yes your majesty
the crowd will cheer and press forward with such enthusiasm that it can be kept in check only by the most heroic efforts of the police
and has all this been well rehearsed ?
oh yes your majesty
they all know their parts perfectly
for two minutes we will have silent homage
your majesty and the prince consort will reward your loyal subjects with happy smiles
you are both in the best of humor
in the best of humor ?
oh yes your majesty
well your majesty i i
well you 'd better tell him to be safe
yes your majesty
and if the prince consort does not smile in joy it will mean disaster
and if he sees any UNknown between you he UNknown l report it to afghanistan
well let him
UNknown hears it too
and what is talked of in persia spreads all over turkey
and when anything is known in turkey the UNknown get onto it immediately
and you know how many UNknown go to america
so if wall street hears of a UNknown in the matrimonial happiness of your majesty it will stop all credits and we do not get the loan
and without that loan we are broke
prince alfred what are you permitting yourself ?
i permit myself to make the following suggestion
we do not need a loan
we have enough natural resources
there is my plan for the national budget
i have worked out everything in my sleepless days
the country can be saved without a loan
not even when they are good ?
not even then
yes your highness
prince alfred you may leave the room
and in case i don 't feel like UNknown with your majesty 's wish ?
this is not my wish
it is my command
i would laugh

and he asked for garlic in his soup at dinner so i heard
good for you not at all
i 'm for that let it go
well here i am still single may my children stay the same
drink to that here 's to you

director of photography
after a hard day of work at the factory michiyo and a friend return home
an orphan michiyo lives with her uncle and aunt
i UNknown e lost my job at the factory
what 's to become of us ?
if michiyo would become a geisha like the owner of the garden of flowers suggested to me it would give us a nice little business
i couldn 't do that to the daughter of my dead sister but the situation is desperate
i need to think about it
michiyo listen to me
never fall in love never depend on men but learn to seduce them
UNknown the son of the rich business man UNknown
that young girl is really pretty !
i took a photo of her i give it to you as a souvenir
some time later at the garden of flowers the geisha house where mr UNknown is a regular customer
michiyo has agreed to become a geisha
she UNknown l be known as UNknown from now on
she is really pretty !
at the bank where UNknown and his friend UNknown UNknown work
why don 't we go to the garden of flowers UNknown ?
sure if you want
i find them all pretty but pitiful
pardon he doesn 't want any ?
well i UNknown l serve him anyway !
UNknown i adore that new geisha !
the old UNknown has also fallen under the spell of UNknown
my little UNknown darling !
i don 't want your gifts !

UNknown recognizes the ring UNknown lost during the argument
madam give this cheque to UNknown and return this ring

at the next room UNknown is also waiting for UNknown
UNknown i love you !
i have made you wait mr
how are you UNknown ?
yes i UNknown e loved UNknown for a long time since the first day i saw her
an heir of the UNknown family cannot marry a geisha my son
believe me it 's impossible for you to marry her
against all customs UNknown has asked UNknown to visit him
you know UNknown ?
for his happiness i 'd consent to it but it 's impossible
if that ring you 'r e wearing was given to you by your mother well UNknown you are my daughter !
i UNknown l marry UNknown even if i have to fight against my whole family !
father what is she doing here ?
UNknown UNknown is your sister !!
at UNknown 's place
UNknown obstacles separate us
UNknown obstacles separate us
UNknown i too love you !
some time later the marriage of UNknown and UNknown is celebrated
i will travel far away to forget
my happiness will never be complete without you UNknown
this belongs to you from now on
there should be one or two bottles left in my trunk
if you want to share a toast
you broke my last bottle of UNknown !
give me my knife back at least !
there is no source at UNknown
the only UNknown which collects rain water is a constant worry for the four solitary men
at daybreak when the tide is low UNknown starts his gathering at one of those thousands of reefs that make the sea so dangerous here
this morning UNknown 's arm feels weak and has none of the usual skill
jean marie on the other hand is already back with a huge crop
the seaweed should be spread and partly dried in the sun before being burned
the harvest season only lasts 3 months
UNknown 's companion is worried
this UNknown must come to an end !
the drought goes on and the water UNknown sinks to an alarming level
with the evening comes some rest
are you mad ?
you think you can get away with such girlish behavior here ?
as you let me down and went to work for jean marie he UNknown l have to feed you !
feverish and helpless UNknown considers going back to his home at UNknown where there is a doctor
UNknown gathers all his force to raise the sail with his only working arm
but the dead calm makes the trip impossible without rowing
UNknown which is separated from UNknown by the difficult UNknown passage is the biggest and UNknown of the islands of the UNknown
jean marie 's mother would never have dared to put on her UNknown again if she had missed the daily mass
but she was on very bad terms with her neighbor UNknown 's mother
UNknown one of the guardians of the UNknown UNknown sell lighthouse finally has his turn of ten days to spend on land
something 's strange on UNknown
only one oven smoking the last 2 days
today none of the boats parted
the devoted doctor UNknown is the youngest islanders best friend despite his 67 years
the locals all have a deep affection for him based on respect and gratitude
the guardian of stiff the lighthouse north east of the island agrees
there is surely something strange going on on UNknown
faced with the register of sailors this people UNknown of widows orphans parents who lost their sons is swift at UNknown
the name of UNknown is whispered
mothers daughters seamen 's wives the UNknown women are fearsome
they try to perceive UNknown
doctor UNknown !
yes it 's UNknown
UNknown we were wrong listen !
pierre we can 't just sit here and watch him suffer like this
we must get him to UNknown
not saying against
with 4 men rowing we won 't manage to go up the stream
come on children we need yet another sailor to get to UNknown
not a soldier but a real sailor !
the fog most dangerous of enemies
the UNknown flag signals UNknown wind
if you 'd put him standing over a napkin covering the money there would be no way you could move him
do you want to bet that i 'd be able to bounce you away if you stood over that napkin ?
you have a face like a squeezed lemon you forgot i 'm battling rolf ?
even if you were the giant goliath reborn you won 't bother a lady in my presence !
if i catch you again fighting in the street you can find yourself another manager !

if you have guts young man you 'd fight rolf in the ring
i UNknown l give one thousand dollars to whoever would be capable to stand 4 rounds with him

the pie marjorie left it there for me
it 's an adventure story the hero is just like you ; he 's kind but naive
tell me clem wouldn 't you like a ride in the merry go round ?
uf ! you told me that already you don 't want me here
i didn 't forget and i UNknown l go away
i have an idea !
you know that battling rolf who 's about to arrive ?
i don 't know him ; but i UNknown e heard about him
you must be blind then !
his face is all over the city on every wall !
rumor has it that he UNknown l pay 1000 dollars to whoever stands four rounds with him
my baby you don 't know how difficult fighting is
don 't be silly !
i UNknown l manage you and we UNknown l beat the hell out of him !
come on keep your guard up !
what the hell are you doing ?
seems like you cradle a kid
that night on his return from the fair dave roberts found and unexpected guest
my friend i thought you 'd be happy to see me
put away that bottle and shut up
i 'm not alone i have a kid with me
what ? you 'r e a mother ?
who 's this walking melon ?
is this the way to speak to a gentleman ?
i don 't see any gentlemen

i can 't agree with you dave you had already chosen the manager
don 't be upset about this clem !
i have another job for you you UNknown l be my agent
if i 'm the agent consider yourself fired
you UNknown l sleep here
he 's smart that little fellow he UNknown l be a lot of help for you

i want to think about it
i hope you UNknown l do what you have to do
god please make me a good guy like dave
a UNknown UNknown
come on clem it 's time to go to your dancing lesson
you are really something !
you see me with admiration eyes
did you make clem forget the fighting fever ?
he 's becoming so good he UNknown l grow wings
roberts i warned you that if clem wouldn 't stop fighting in the streets i 'd send him to the house of correction
i UNknown l let him go this time but if i UNknown l ever catch him again i won 't be so forgiving !
how did you get that bruise ?
i hit the door UNknown
i want you to promise that you UNknown l count to ten before going to UNknown
are you the one who goes on blaring the force of that roberts the flea
well your roberts is nothing but an impostor !
what you saw is nothing !
my grandfather saw roberts fighting in fairfax he 's a cheat like all the others in his gang
you got in a fight again ?
is this how you keep your word ?
you promised me that you 'd count to ten !
i did count dave !
don 't ask me anything dave you must know just that i couldn 't do otherwise
answer me why did you fight ?
you 'r e a stubborn man !
you don 't want to say it you UNknown e done something wrong i 'm sure !
you UNknown l tell me or else i UNknown l get the words out of you !
you were unfair dave !
don 't tell him anything marjorie
he didn 't hurt me
don 't pity him the little brat deserved to be punished
i know he got into a fight dave but he fought for you you should be proud of him
a boy told him that you 'r e an impostor
i 'm ashamed of myself marjorie !
i wouldn 't dare to look him in the eyes the poor boy !
it 's ironic marjorie !
clem fought for me for my honor and i 'm nothing but a jerk !
can 't you understand ?
i am an impostor ! a clown !
i 'm a puppet to rolf and his gang !
my training the fight and then being beaten it 's all a scam a clumsy comedy !
tell me this isn 't true dave !
don 't let me believe that i was a part of this comedy too !
no marjorie !
don 't be sad dave
i promise i won 't fight ever again !
but if anyone says again that you 'r e not a real fighter i UNknown l punch his head away !
clem my boy i swear nobody could ever insult me again !
stop imitating that fool
why did you come here in the middle of the day ?
we have to be careful not to arise suspicions
i just wanted to say that i don 't want to be part of your scam anymore
you damn fool you think i want to play this game again
i thought about it
ah you want to fight for real little flea ?
what are you doing dave ?
you want to quit now that all the city is with you ?
all of them placed bets on you ; big bets because they are sure to win !
we UNknown l lose ?
it 's not the time for talking nonsense !
i bet all the money i have too !
are you in pain ?
what happened ?
i hit the door UNknown !
am i your agent or what ?
i have the right to know who did this to you !
battling rolf ?
no ; we won 't fight tonight
take the cash ; take it to marjorie and tell her it 's for you
tell her that i ask her only to take care of you
you can 't understand clem !
i have got to go
i must run
i 'm not your little boy anymore ?
you 'd have better left me on the streets !
no dave !
you can 't give up the fight only because a jerk punched you while you wasn 't aware !
think about it if you go all of them would say you 'r e an impostor and i 'd have to punch out the whole city !
so long old partner !
my heart breaks thinking that you UNknown l be crushed like a pigeon 's egg !
get your hands off ! unless you don 't want to drop dead right now !

i think they 'r e onto him
is this standard issue from UNknown for their creatures ?
they made me do it !
i didn 't
that is what you did my son
you embraced him with all your wretched corrupt withered soul
and what is the name of the intelligence officer you report to ?
we have to get him out of there
all right danny you and me
walk up and ask for our friend back
his wire 's on
i sent him to five 's clinic in UNknown
he was tortured ?
we need to find out if there is a threat here
yet our only agent is a UNknown youth
could you talk to him ?
no he was too far gone
they put the fear of god into him
sighs did i notice her ?
she noticed you
i do mind you saying it
why is cla london suddenly sharing with us ?
christine is a nice woman
i doubt that 's why
americans always want you to do something
oh you 'r e in here
oh sorry !
she UNknown l be handling intelligence analysis in this department
am i late ?
ruth we are struggling with UNknown UNknown
problems in three london UNknown were resolved by the UNknown
but our main concern is a UNknown in birmingham mohammed UNknown
he came from afghanistan when we saw that country as a friendly place
how one forgets
there was a shortage of religious leaders and they wanted to help
must have done well but mohammed UNknown has become
and when a plane turns above a city in the west
who will not think of the flight of the martyrs into the twin towers ?
lt is a blessing that there are young among us who stand ready for UNknown
satan may lash out at them
but they are ready for the bliss of their reward in paradise
cla london have just told us they found documents in UNknown naming UNknown as an UNknown intelligence officer linked to al UNknown
we let a wolf into the fold
the mosque 's divided between UNknown of UNknown and the followers of this man
mr UNknown came to birmingham in the early UNknown UNknown
while UNknown may be a thug UNknown has made no official complaint
but UNknown and his group appear to have the run of the mosque
every religion has crooked priests
our question is is this one a threat to national security ?
why don 't we close it down ?
home office UNknown
bugger the home office
all of you find me another agent
i want to speak to special branch
could you please leave ?
i 'm not in this country to tolerate fools !
come on sir
armed police stand still !
i can be of great use to your country
so he 's not said anything at all ?
is that surprising after what you did to him ?
i 'm sorry ?
it 's your world too sadly
it 's my job to make it safer
he 's in here
you did all right
i really am sorry
you see we don 't get medals for what we do
all we get is respect
and respect you have johnny big time
there are men twice your age who couldn 't have gone through what you have
you 'r e one of us now
that 's what they said
that 's what they said
they want to turn me into a bomb man !
they want me to be the one !
then they found out i was one of you lot
suicide bombers ?
how serious are they ?
have they got explosives ?
have they got detonators ?
where do they want the bombers to kill themselves johnny ?
it 's what UNknown call their school for suicide bombers
suicide bomber attacks in the heart of england
any chance the boy can tell us more ?
they told me it happens with victims of that particular torture blood UNknown
harry we have got to find out if this is true
let me go and rattle UNknown 's cage as hard as i can
aren 't you now ?
forgive me for keeping you mr ?
you 'r e from the home office UNknown service mr anderson ?
you have identification ?
you have applied for citizenship
i have to tell you your application will fail
mr UNknown was granted permanent leave to remain in the UNknown eight years ago
after seven years he is entitled to full citizenship
unless there is an impediment
there is none
whom UNknown did mr UNknown kidnap ?
a young man
he was a spy
don 't UNknown and the immigration services readily exchange personnel ?
we 'r e going to clear this mosque of nests
you think we have mice ?
the authorities can put traps down
mice are innocent creatures
is that what you 'r e doing to young men in your community ?
we are going to throw you out of this country
UNknown what a sad apology for an intelligence service
secret policemen in other countries can arrest beat electric shock even kill but what can you do ?
a smear in the press ?
a meaningless threat ?
and very dangerous
he took us to that new hamburger joint on the ross bridge road
what is wrong with that ?
it 's american shit
forgive me UNknown sahib
america is the enemy of islam
that is true
he doesn 't pray
he drinks tins of UNknown
he lives in england
who taught you that ?
shall i tell you a secret ?
one day england will become the house of islam
no hamburgers no tins of UNknown
all the people of this island will honour god and follow his prophet peace be upon him
but how could that happen ?
by the blood of martyrs my son
we need another agent in that mosque
have we got anyone ?
there is someone who could help
don 't even think it
UNknown ran excellent UNknown agents
but not all of them existed
she UNknown 150 grand in expenses !
that 's why we fired her
i 'm not here to fight UNknown
oh god you want help
you do don 't you ?
we desperately need a good UNknown agent capable of penetrating UNknown contacts
can you help us ?
you 'r e joking ?
we could have a major incident on our hands
if you help the service now maybe in the future
the service treated me like a leper
i 'm making my own way now
this is a matter of national security
for our country
you were a great officer
let 's say i felt my talents weren 't valued
what do you mean ?
you think you should have had harry 's job ?
was shattered in an instant
the suicide bomber had joined a queue outside the nightclub
his bomb contained ball bearings and nails
all the occupants of the bus are either dead or injured
victims of the human bombs bringing death
nearly 60 were injured and nine were beyond the help of the medics
that death toll includes three babies and a four year old child
these horrors are in other countries streets
if we don 't act now they UNknown l come to ours too
so we have nothing
nest of angels
and i UNknown e just UNknown
UNknown what ?
i UNknown e hacked into the UNknown of the UNknown UNknown g n UNknown de la d UNknown
you hacked into the french security service ?
they do it to us
this is the tramp the UNknown threw out onto the street
muhammad UNknown UNknown
left wing ish
this he did with success
but in the end they blew his cover
a car bomb meant for him killed his family
but he 's a crack agent who didn 't want to talk to the french but to us
and special branch nearly chucked him out
if you with the eyes have any authority make these fools understand
i can be of great use to your country
but he 's an illegal and a UNknown
we don 't know what he is
he 's wearing a skirt
peter pan he 's not a man
mr muhammad UNknown UNknown ?
mr john UNknown ?
why should they ?
a story about a boy who didn 't want to grow up ?
no a story about being safe where you can play in tree houses all day long
is that how you see this country ?
how do you see mine ?
UNknown maidens in desert tents offering dates on gold plates ?
you have something to offer us
why not ?
why not let anyone in the world live where they want ?
shall we return to reality ?
we know about the UNknown
is that it ?
there is a gentleman in a mosque in birmingham who has links with the UNknown
his name is mohammed UNknown
hell 's bells
we are prepared to offer you a british passport
as much as is within our power
if you become an agent run by us there UNknown l be no going back
bring on your lions
with the sandwiches i went for cream cheese with UNknown
good for the soul to be tea boy now and then
let 's go through this one more time
so after your family died you decided to leave UNknown
and the UNknown secret services let you go ?
of course not
i disguised myself as a camel
wouldn 't you be in our position ?
when the UNknown killed my family
anyway i decided to leave the nightmare my country had become
i got to france
my last report was that my cover was blown and they were after me
then i disappeared to be reborn in england
so as far as the UNknown secret services are concerned
i am dead
there is a possibility that we are being penetrated by a dangerous double agent working for god knows whom the UNknown secret service ?
the UNknown intelligence service ?
an al UNknown UNknown ?
could be a disaster for us
or he 's telling the truth
offering his services to a country with which he has fallen in love
that 's what we want to believe
then we will
the UNknown mosque in birmingham
we want you to go in undercover and UNknown mohammed UNknown 's group
but i told you UNknown is UNknown by UNknown UNknown
they killed my family
why me a stranger from abroad ?
we don 't have the personnel of the right culture
you mean colour
in birmingham ?
we need to know everything they 'r e doing
my family is dead
i want to speak to the office of the vice chancellor of the university
mr UNknown ?
it doesn 't matter who we are
i UNknown e got your vat returns and there 's a problem
why do you want to stay at the university ?
i UNknown l want to come and go at the campus
if you want to hide hide amongst the young
i UNknown e been looking for you
have you ?
what is it ?
there is one issue
it 's UNknown
the name means nothing
they 'r e sure he came to england
UNknown agents that can be trusted are gold dust
i can 't help you
we haven 't heard of a UNknown
you mean you don 't want to share him
we helped you out with info on the UNknown in birmingham
oh yes UNknown
look um we could go for another coffee out of here
i don 't think so
we have this from ?
everything set in birmingham ?
dressed in this he enters heaven
why not hold it ?
don 't worry it 's not armed
it is a religious community of poor people
i could be anywhere in the world
have you seen UNknown and UNknown ?
UNknown s it genuine ? UNknown ow can we tell ?
UNknown ave you talked to them ? 'i m waiting to be asked
well take care
don 't worry
i have a present for you from the university UNknown
i was pleased to see it on sale actually
don 't hang around the students
UNknown 'i t 's strange in this country where for so long i have dreamed of being
i think more and more of the book
UNknown is studying mathematics for a levels
god favours it
islam was the most advanced civilisation in the world
how greek mathematics and the works of aristotle were first translated in italy in the 12th century from arabic
the school of UNknown in sicily
you 'r e an educated man
in the sight of god we are all ignorant
this glorious islam
the school of UNknown was closed by the catholic church
with good reason
you say you are from morocco
i think you are UNknown
they sent you those UNknown those UNknown from abroad
i have to appeal to your generosity
i am an UNknown
god UNknown enough of you in the mosque !
for his purpose whatever it may be
remember help the angels
something is going to come to a head
will she help you get to UNknown ?
she already has
have you got the money ?
you UNknown l have to sign for this
ah money from the british treasury
like blood from a stone ?
and what is that ?
we can record you and anyone within a range of ten feet
and this ?
one layer of real UNknown
beneath a single purpose device with a net UNknown
this ridiculous james UNknown do we need it ?
we need evidence against UNknown
if he 's guilty kill him
use them at your own discretion
i thank you for your hospitality mohammed UNknown
you came through the tunnel
my job was arranged for me by the british intelligence services
it was praise to god UNknown easy to do so
you are either a very brave man or a fool
in the holy cause we serve aren 't all both ?
UNknown UNknown i want to believe you but you will have to prove yourself to me
then let me do so
abu UNknown is dead
forgive me i will say where but for your ear only
the fruit of the UNknown tree shall be the sinner 's food
here are funds from your UNknown brothers
praise be to god the most compassionate the merciful !
all praise be to god !
the hostel he 's at hasn 't seen him
no messages ?
they could be UNknown a kid to blow up the centre of birmingham right now
i 'm coming out in hives on this one
what if UNknown 's not what he says he is ?
what do you mean ?
what if he 's been an UNknown all along ?
what if he 's come to UNknown the attack ?
if you think that we UNknown e got to send special forces in
the trouble is i don 't know
i just can 't read him
danny 's right
don 't turn on the light
i got away for a few hours
a UNknown window
why did you ?
they watch me all the time
everyone else is watching everyone else in there
in where ?
a suicide bombing
and every time the same people are there
ln the centre sit six young men
the evening starts easily enough but things always end the same way
what is it to wear 150 american trainer shoes ?
to put on jackets with a label from milan in italy ?
for the west sells you the illusion of an earthly paradise
it has to
you know the way to true paradise through a martyr 's death
death to america and her allies !
death to the UNknown !
death to the west !
it was after the meeting that he told me
what do you think of our youth ?
they are god fearing fine young men
they live a difficult life surrounded by the sorcery of america
may god relieve them of their burdens
oh he will
you want me to do this ?
would you ?
we have chosen the boy
and he told me
UNknown e 's 16 years old
'a nd what is your role ?
i am to tell him the target and take him there
UNknown hat is the target ? 'i won 't be told until the last moment
why do they trust you to do this ?
it 's a test
and it 's an old trick
get the stranger to do the filthy thing
and if things go wrong he can be blamed
i 'm pulling you out of this operation now
if the boy is arrested think what will happen to him
he won 't be dead !
i want to talk to him to persuade him to give himself up to save himself to save the decent UNknown at the mosque from this terrible thing
will they let you be alone with him ?
only at the end
harry will block that
no one leaves this room
ah the gentleman from UNknown
mohammed UNknown i am arresting you under the charity commission act of UNknown
under suspicion of keeping false records
charity commission ?
we have a warrant to search for hidden account books
i wish to speak to my lawyer
where is the boy martyr ?
where is UNknown UNknown ?
i UNknown l speak to him alone
what UNknown the minds of the young mr anderson ?
how can they think this is a path to paradise ?

death to america and her allies !
death to the UNknown !
death to the west !
come martyr of god !
hold still while i will take away this terrible thing
the boy is armed !
stay back !
you too !
abu why do you want to do this ?
to die in the face of oppression
the only freedom is in the house of islam
the house of islam will never be built in this country with violence
that is not for us to judge
victory is only granted by god
UNknown let 's do this my way
abu mr UNknown is going to step back
no i will stay here with you until this is all over
it 's a pointless death
do not UNknown with a man who is going to paradise !
this shirt it 's villa ?
suicide is a bit extreme even for a villa UNknown
in my country some people say football goes against the teaching of the UNknown
what do you think ?
don 't leave the human race abu
the prophet himself peace be upon him had to struggle with demons and angels abu
there is no shame
i can intercede for 70 loved ones
the UNknown is wrong
i do !
the only paradise we will see is the paradise we make here on earth abu

gladstone is the man for us
i consider it an affront to every english gentleman that the destinies of our nation should be in the hands of a person like disraeli
a man who poses as a great patriot but who is in reality an UNknown politician seeking only to UNknown his mad lust for power
and now he wants to involve us in serious international trouble with this infernal nonsense about russia trying to undermine our power in india
if the fellow keeps on he UNknown l put england on the rocks
what does the governor of the bank of england say ?
i say he 's a dreamer
a dangerous UNknown reaching out for empire with greedy hands committing us to a foreign policy of UNknown that makes me tremble for england 's safety
but thank god for gladstone
he 's more than a match for disraeli
unworthy to be the guardian of england 's welfare
unworthy to hold the high office of prime minister
and now that my honourable friend mr gladstone with his customary eloquence and tact has expressed his customary UNknown the issue gentlemen is this
have you ever seen one of those moving UNknown of the coast of south america ?
you behold a range of exhausted UNknown
not a flame UNknown on a single UNknown peak
but beneath there is a UNknown danger that will one day awake
dizzy you 'r e worrying about something
no no my dear
well i UNknown l not bother you now about our garden party
but i 'm dying to be bothered
mary my dear your morning tribute
thank you dizzy
nonsense you know i married you for your money
let me see our list of invitations
lady clarissa UNknown oh and her father and mother the duke and duchess of UNknown
i 'm afraid the duke and duchess shiver with contempt at the very name of disraeli
but clarissa will see to it that they come
and she 's right
young UNknown will UNknown to come in order to protect clarissa against my diabolical influence
i 'm quite sure your party will be a great success
mary i want you to invite UNknown
mrs travers ?
that 's why i want you to invite her
i 'm anxious to cultivate her acquaintance
oh we UNknown e met her at dinners
now dizzy you 'r e off on one of your wild goose chases again
blue and white
you 'r e looking more charming than usual
UNknown sit down
we UNknown e nothing immediate to fear from disraeli
he can 't act without parliament
and parliament has adjourned thank the lord
yes england has UNknown tied the hands of the one man who might have blocked russia 's plans
and long before his hands are free we shall have come to terms with egypt
russia will control the suez canal
and disraeli 's dream of british UNknown in asia will still be only a dream
but don 't forget
he must be watched as closely as ever
mr UNknown is outside
i got a note from him this morning telling me i might have the rest of the week off and thanking me for my faithful attention to his interests
i 'm afraid the great disraeli is getting old
how do you do ?
the spirit of youth and beauty
UNknown behold !
if something would only happen to charles to make him human
perhaps something may happen to him my dear
with the help of clarissa
how fortunate england has men like you
why mrs travers i
the prime minister 's garden
why do you dislike mr disraeli so much ?
i neither like him nor dislike him
he 's nothing to me
don 't you feel lonely ?
but we won 't argue about that now
may you be seated lady clarissa ?
i have spoken to your mother and she has given me her gracious permission to address you
was her permission needed ?
well i 'm rather a UNknown for form you know
i have plans for building model UNknown with improved sanitary UNknown
i trust my wife and i will show our friends a model english household model children in short a model
have i not made myself clear ?
since first i had the privilege of meeting you i have watched you closely
i have decided that in time you will become admirably suited to occupy the position i have UNknown
i beg your pardon
may i call you charles ?
thank you but is this really an offer of marriage ?
i hoped i had made that clear without offensive UNknown of speech
i mean the manner of your proposal
i 'm a girl of 19 and you come to me with an essay on political economy
i 'm a man of heavy responsibilities not a hero of romance
you will enter a family of which the men have never done anything to be ashamed of
have they ever done anything ?
nothing thank god to attract attention
well i think the next thing will be to announce our betrothal
i beg your pardon !
oh charles you UNknown e made a horrible hash of the whole thing
i did like you
but your model UNknown leave me cold because i know the laborer wants bread not bricks
and all those model children
i want flesh and blood children who tear their UNknown and smear their faces with jam
but lady clarissa
i want a husband who is at the bottom and is climbing
climbing on hands and knees
bleeding hands and bleeding knees
with his eyes fixed on the summit
never mind if he never gets there
i can help him to climb and if he falls i can fall with him
you sit in a UNknown atmosphere like the gods on olympus
oh how did you know ?
that back was eloquent of refusal
you have no sympathy with UNknown greatness
you refused UNknown because he 's a mere UNknown and not an ancestor
well am i not right ?
well he may become an ancestor you know
i like him very much
if he had simply said clarissa will you marry me ?
i might have answered just as simply yes
but he UNknown me on model UNknown and the model family
you know i have a very high opinion of him
who knows ?
a man should make his own opportunity
and it 's no use talking
i refused him and i told him why
as he is now i would sooner marry a UNknown
he does lay bricks and he may build a cathedral
don 't be hard on UNknown
go along and tell him you 'r e sorry
very good advice mr disraeli which i 'm not going to follow
a telegram sir
but clarissa would come
there 's a little matter on which i particularly want your advice
oh very well
mrs travers duke i 'm sure you UNknown l forgive me for taking sir michael away
sit down sir michael sit down
i UNknown e just had private information
UNknown UNknown pasha is in desperate need of money
as you know he holds the controlling shares of the suez canal
UNknown this is an UNknown opportunity for england
opportunity for england ?
pardon me ?
i heave seldom meant anything half so seriously
and you are about to suggest to me that the bank of england should back you ?
i shall never consent
i UNknown l not allow the bank to play ducks and UNknown with its money
on an egyptian ditch
how do i know
what difference does that make ?
don 't the UNknown invariably go on just where the UNknown left off and vice versa ?
besides in this case it hasn 't time to fall
this thing must be done within the next three weeks
long before parliament meets
then why hasn 't she purchased ?
she 's not ready
she 's watching me
hmm a pretty woman mrs travers
UNknown and the bank will be no party to it
i tell you there is no time
you exaggerate the importance of the thing
you have the eastern imagination
because this canal runs through a desert you see it in a dream
in a mirage
the UNknown that passed UNknown it last year
oh please !
soon the only ship sailing on it will be the the ship of the desert
i mean the camel sir
yes i thought you meant the camel
beware of the east
yes but what about moses ?
he was a jew
in short ?
and the bank will not stir a finger to further that
why are you er
i rejoice to think that i have made this rash enterprise impossible
oh but you haven 't
where would you go for the money ?
where pharaoh went
at any rate understand it will be no use coming to me
this sir is definite and final
nothing is final sir michael
in the unlikely event of moses failing me
i may send for you again
and i shall not come sir
i think you will
lady UNknown 's in a dreadful way
she 's missed her husband
has she ?
all right my dear
hugh meyers tha banker ?
hugh meyers the banker
that 's the man
dizzy you 'r e not worrying about money ?
no no my dear
there 's UNknown
that will be a good match i suppose
yes but she has refused
mary i 'm going to play fairy godfather and bring them together
you a matchmaker
the less a prime minister does the fewer mistakes he 's apt to make
thats rather good
i UNknown e been searching for a young man
with such a prize as clarissa charles may become just what i need
think what a splendid couple they 'd make
is it UNknown ?
i think he wants to kill me
what do you mean sir ?
it 's the tone of an angry man
now what can have put you out ?
no no don 't speak
interruptions are annoying
i might have become a UNknown and respectable
really mr disraeli you make it difficult to talk to you seriously
never talk seriously
i er never make jokes
a man who never makes jokes is a standing joke to the world
humor is of several kinds
we oxford men have a humor of our own
what do you mean ?
you have courage or you would never say that to me
and why should i not say it ?
because it 's true
there was no other way
i suppose she knows her own mind
because i 'm interested in you
interested in me ?
i can 't see that
england was never so prosperous as now
she has a wise aristocracy an UNknown middle class a contented and happy UNknown
bravo bravo !
and that 's how they UNknown e talked since the beginning of things
that 's how they talked when they lost america
when the indian mutiny bashed upon us
when our soldiers froze and starved in the UNknown
when we deserted denmark and when we remained idle while france and germany flew at each other 's throats
it 's just that talk that has lost us all our UNknown
oh continental UNknown
i do not discuss politics with women
her crew know nothing about what they call the land UNknown
they go on shore now and then for a UNknown
but as they only hunt out the vice they come back with a headache and UNknown thank god they 'r e not as other men
i tell you a UNknown is at work all over the world titanic forces take shape in america
forces you have no conception of
the spirit of nationality is aroused in france in italy in germany
new wine is being poured into old bottles and an explosion will follow sooner or later
i shall not live to see it but i hear the UNknown of the UNknown
but you my god what things you will witness
take care you are not asleep
all the nations must expand and everywhere our empire is in their way
russia for instance
with india lost a whole fabric UNknown and england sinks into UNknown
a belgium at sea
these are the things i have shown her
you wonder she wants a man of action ?
you wonder she 's not contented with being a mere duke 's wife ?
what can any one man do ?
what one man has already done
you sir ?
you can learn
leave your small ideals
you have begun well
now pass on
in politics nothing is insignificant
contrast it with this question of india
whether we hold it or lose it
what 's the solution ?
it 's an UNknown
a very small thing
what sir what ?
a ditch ?
you mean the
oh mrs travers
you UNknown l have so much to teach him
mr disraeli has already begun
what is that ?
dizzy what do you mean ?
good morning sir
he was not here sir
these are ready for delivery sir
thank you UNknown
and have those delivered for me
is there anything else sir ?
nothing else mr UNknown
i beg your pardon sir
quite a natural mistake
from the argentine
in three weeks
the bank of england ?
that 's rather humorous
one of the world 's greatest powers
we have to raise money you know for the fortifications of the gulf of UNknown
i hoped it was something much more romantic than that sir
oh what ?
it is the suez canal
since you UNknown e hit on the truth it 's better that i should tell you that until i am ready not a syilable must be breathed on this matter
is that clear ?
excuse me sir
oh thank you mr UNknown
mr meyers this is mr UNknown
such a working man
you have the papers you know the blue one
i UNknown l find out sir
i 'm very busy
he 's here for the suez canal
lady clarissa UNknown and mrs travers are here
here 's an invasion
well it hasn 't UNknown my constitution yet
we expected to find you with a wet towel around your head
oh no so far i UNknown e done nothing but look on
this is a wonderful opportunity for you
that will be a UNknown for UNknown
i 'm delighted
ah mrs travers
my dear ladies you UNknown l excuse us
was this a momentous interview ?
i really cannot tell you
that means that it was
how exciting to be in all the state secrets
but i am not
how humbly you speak of yourself
i know now that i know nothing
that 's a great stride towards your goal isn 't it ?
is it ?
blue and white
such a worker
no better i fear
will you kindly make my excuses to the young people
they 'r e out there
you 'r e not going so abruptly
i 'm sorry but dear lady UNknown is organizing a bazaar
always occupied in good work
always with your hand in some great undertaking
it 's secret too ?
goodbye mr disraeli
goodbye mrs travers
i thought you called
meyers visit ?
yes go on
not a word of course
how did you UNknown him ?
i merely stood up
do you accuse me of speaking ?
no sir i accuse you of holding your tongue too UNknown
oh well he 's easily UNknown
i UNknown l fetch him
yes fetch him fetch him
mr UNknown !
he 's at victoria station
catching the 10 30 express on his way to ostend UNknown and so to cairo
for god 's sake sir who is he ?
he 's mrs travers husband
spies russia has sent here to discover what you have told them
have him arrested
sir why did you employ him knowing he was a spy ?
because i knew it
for weeks he has been secretly entering this room
i knew it
i had him on the wrong scent when you
when i UNknown
would you tell us why silence is so important ?
now it 's of no importance whatever
and the only pyramid he has raised is the pyramid of death
egypt is a dry bone out of which he has sucked the last ounce of UNknown
the last assets he has are the controlling shares in the suez canal
and these he is dying to sell to the highest bidder
france built the canal but is too poor to buy it
russia UNknown it as a means of snatching india
england has the means of defending it
both pretend the purchase is the last thing in the world they 'r e thinking of
both are watching each other like cats
and UNknown sits and waits for the cat to jump
those shares i mean to have
but now UNknown knows russia knows
in a week UNknown will be in cairo and whatever sum they offer he will double
now do you see the importance of it ?
there 's no remedy
with unlimited powers
what must be the man 's qualifications ?
a strong stern silent man
subtle and cunning
i UNknown e sent for him
what is it clarissa ?
what is it my dear ?
oh i thought for a minute while you were speaking that perhaps charles might
oh don 't say it
clarissa don 't say it
yes do say it clarissa
do say it
what kind ?
so truthful they 'd swear he was lying
so simple they 'd never fathom him
why laugh at me so ?
i feel my folly bitterly enough !
what 's the matter charles ?
why despair ?
why not ?
well granting that what i didn 't say it
but granting that that 's a very good reason for sending you
but i UNknown e failed already
nearly all my successes are founded on previous failures
on your own showing no one will ever suspect you
you have only to meet all their cunning with that UNknown british face of yours and the schemes will be UNknown
come will you go ?
will i go ?
i warn you there will be grave danger
are you ready to meet it ?
every hour of the day
danger lurking in every disguise
and once he is in egypt if his errand be known his life wil not be worth a moment 's purchase
oh i didn 't know
i didn 't know !
clarissa my child
that a great reward is awaiting his return
if i succeed ?
i think i could start the day after tomorrow
how do you mean sir ?
UNknown will have a 48 hours start with UNknown
you mean i shall be too late ?
i 'm trying to convey that impression
well tomorrow then if it must be
that 's better
well there 's a night mail tonight at nine
but my luggage
damn your collar
you UNknown l be in marseilles tomorrow and in cairo a day ahead of UNknown
a day ahead !
of course you will
the hope he allowed of reward ?
if he had not said it i should have
a reward will be mine if i succeed
or if you fail
i love you
money instructions and the code for telegrams
i keep the duplicate
what am i to do ?
would you care to go for a drive ?
oh you 'r e heartless
how am i to wait ?
how am i to wait ?
very noble and UNknown birds i assure you
master where are we going with that spade ?
don 't blame me if you caught your death
caught me death ?
tis well known you ought to be in your bed
a highly respectable sheet
says dr williams has been seen going in and out o here
and that 'd be true too
for he just UNknown by and left this bottle of stuff for ye
for me ?
dr williams has been here twice to see lady UNknown who had a fainting fit
and that 's all
i believe so sir
are you so deeply in love ?
about mrs travers ?
not a sound
i don 't like people who keep quiet
she might do a great deal of mischief
so lady UNknown has persuaded her to come here today
i want to have that glorious creature where i can see her
ah mary my dear
of course i have
he doubts everybody 's words
he doubts mine
do you know what this foolish woman did a little while ago ?
she drove with me one night to the house of UNknown when i had to make a very important speech
the UNknown slammed the carriage door and crushed her finger in it
and i knew nothing about it until i got home
you UNknown l be doing just as wonderful things and thinking just as little of them
well if you 'r e telling the truth you shall have your morning offering
clarissa never UNknown to my health before dizzy
is anything the matter ?
nothing nothing to make a fuss about
dr williams says i must be careful
i am so that 's all right
now mind not a word to dizzy
a crushed finger again ?
gladly every day for his sake
the last rose of summer
thank you dizzy
while i read this telegram from my tailor
it is from cairo !
what does it say ?
the celery is ripe to cut
the celery is ripe to cut ?
i must say i hardly think it was worthwhile going to the extent
what does it mean ?
a great deal more than it says
the parallel sentence
it 's worth it
glad for now that other dream of mine will be realized
what dream ?
empress of india ?
mary you shall be my messenger when the time is ripe
oh some time must UNknown
this must be formally UNknown
public opinion must be created
make haste dizzy make haste
there 's another impatient woman mary
i must telegraph this to meyers
another jew mary
how furious old UNknown will be
hugh meyers london wall
but you haven 't answered my question !
will charles come home soon ?
yes with drums beating trumpets blowing flags flying
oh i don 't care anything about that
and wedding bells ringing
mrs travers ?
she 'd worm this out of you in no time
she 'd read it in both your faces
dizzy you made me like her
well get rid of her send her away kill her
put your wits together both of you
tell her i 'm very ill
that i 'm very ill indeed
show him in at once
that 's splendid
would charles have cabled him ?
if he 's coming to tell us don 't spoil its effect
don 't tell him
ah mr meyers delighted to see you
lady clarissa UNknown you know
what happy winds ?
oh these ladies
why of course
i 'm sorry that is impossible
but thank you very much
one moment sir
what i have to say
it 's so much harder than i expected
our house is bankrupt
i wish to god i were
you mean you 'r e temporarily pressed you 'r e in temporary difficulties
i mean we are bankrupt
but that seems impossible
so i should have thought
what have you been doing ?
all the crew saved
and that is not all
what else ?
and now this mysterious wreck
i 'm being pressed
my UNknown have been bought up ah feel angry as you like
you 'r e justified
and now i come before you in the light of a common cheat oh !
who do you mean ?
i don 't know
and who is that ?
samuel UNknown a great solicitor
does anyone else know ?
not a living soul
thank heaven i 'm in time
thank heaven that has not gone through
when will it be known meyers ?
when will it be known ?
tonight tomorrow morning
get back to town quickly
get to your office
don 't budge if i keep you there all night
don 't let anyone else
don 't give the slightest hint of anything unusual
we have to act lightly
watch your words watch your looks
something may happen
i 'm in the worst i was ever in
now meyers is failed we can 't pay
and you ?
what does that matter ?
it 's all that matters to me
i hadn 't thought of that
what will happen to me
no man can live through
i UNknown l face the nation !
i UNknown l bear it alone !
not alone dear
so soon ? what could i do ?
shouldn 't we go up to town ?
i can 't
the prime minister can 't stir without setting the whole world UNknown
the papers have said i 'm ill
if i 'm seen in UNknown street now during the recess when i 'm supposed to be ill every newspaper in the world would grow hysterical
it 's horrible mary
i UNknown l get rid of her
get rid of her ?
mr UNknown ask her to wait
show her in when i ring
surely you will not receive her now
we must keep her here
dizzy what is this play acting ?
i 'm ill
mrs travers is here
no no no
i didn 't know whether to come or not
i 'm sure you can 't want to see me
is that mrs travers dear ?
i 'm very weak
well i 'm
you 'r e so bright
so young and so
isn 't it good of her mary ?
sweet clarissa more beautiful every day
i saw the dear duchess your mother yesterday
she seems very anxious about lord UNknown
he 's abroad too isn 't he ?
egypt or somewhere
i do hope he 's not too UNknown
cairo is such a dreadful place
those UNknown you know
we UNknown e just heard from UNknown
you say you have heard ?
what mrs travers ?
where is that telegram mary ?
on the table dear
heavens how pale i am
the celery is ripe to cut
well you know he 's engaged in a very interesting agricultural experiment
you remember we were discussing that very subject at the garden party
and all UNknown
sir michael UNknown out of town
i beg your pardon ?
i UNknown e been trying to remember his name all day
UNknown of course
and of the UNknown
may i have a look at them ?
she has the code
oh please don 't trouble
you can drive there in 3 minutes
i want you to fetch him at once
i UNknown l order the carriage
but if he refuses to come ?
you tell him it 's a matter of life and death
but mrs travers ?
that must be signed
do come and sit down
but i really ought to be going
we shall be gone only a very few moments
he UNknown l cure me
and you should stay and nurse the poor sick man
i 'm dreadfully sorry but
you must stay
what a dainty hand
UNknown trifles scraps of paper
oh just let me go
you 'r e hurting me
you 'r e in such a hurry to get away from the poor sick man ?
to get away and read the code ?
remember me ?
i remembered you but i couldn 't place you
i connected you with something blue and white
milk and water ?
geneva in the UNknown UNknown
russian refugees and their english UNknown
a man called UNknown and his ravishing shall i say wife ?
but people are cruel
UNknown in russian pay engaged in UNknown out the secrets of the refugees in tempting them back to russia to siberia to death
and pray what has all this to do with me ?
ah what indeed ?
and where do you think i saw him next ?
in UNknown street
i was so sorry for him that i gave him work
but you did more
dear mrs UNknown travers UNknown ?
why steal that ?
the celery is ripe to cut means the suez canal purchase is completed and the check accepted
poor dear old UNknown has had all that tiresome journey for nothing
i congratulate you
ah that 's what any of us do mrs travers
a success that will cost you dear
that 's the sort of thing gladstone will say
it 's what the world will say when it knows that meyers is bankrupt
the world knows what ?
meyers is bankrupt
don 't jest with me
meyers is bankrupt and his check waste paper
because it was my invention
you thought to UNknown me with your apple faced boy
what do you say now mr disraeli ?
you can 't expect me to say much
i am a child in your hands
oh mr disraeli i 'm sorry to hear that you are ill
i 'm so much better
mrs travers stimulating company
but he 's not a
a specialist ?
if you 'r e not ill why have you sent for me ?
UNknown sit down
don 't go mrs travers
this may interest you too
i told you i might send for you
when we had our last delightful interview
oh i thought as much
your hare brained scheme
well it 's no use appealing to me
moses has not failed me and i UNknown e carried the scheme through
the power and the glory of my country were at stake
i had to act quickly and i had to act on my own responsibility
then let me tell you sir you have committed a crime
as parliament was not sitting to vote the money i had to seek it elsewhere
five million sterling you refused
i did and i 'm proud of it
i went to the UNknown private firm to hugh meyers
i sent UNknown to UNknown
spies got wind of what i was doing and russia knew
so UNknown had to go in a hurry
a race for an empire
he has succeeded understand me ?
i put the matter quite simply
UNknown has bought the canal and has paid for it with meyers check drawn on the bank of england
meyers is bankrupt
i UNknown it
you must get out of it as best you can
it 's no use appealing to me
no and i will not appeal to you
i will command you
if meyers 's position is saved we can gain time
the bank of england must give him unlimited credit today now !
you don 't know what you 'r e saying
you don 't know to whom you 'r e speaking
i 'm an englishman
and i 'm not to be ordered about by an alien
moreover he happens to be the prime minister
you threaten me ?
oh empty threats
what becomes of you ?
mr disraeli !
what becomes of the bank ?
you can 't touch the bank !
i UNknown l smash the bank !
parliament 's granted the bank it 's charter
parliament can withdraw it and shall withdraw it at my bidding your board of directors will be swept away your UNknown bankrupt the bank ruined and you UNknown
i am prime minister
that 's an outrage that a man like you should have such power
oh mr disraeli thank god you have such power
i haven 't dear child but he doesn 't know that
let her sleep as long as possible
but i can 't say anything more at present
i can 't go
mr disraeli i know how you feel but you must go
i feel bound to remind you that queen victoria is going to attend your reception in person
that is an honor she has never before paid to a prime minister
all the court will be there
every country in the world will be represented
and all to pay homage to you
and mary won 't be there
you know she always loved people to flatter me
all england will be at your feet tonight
and mary won 't be there
i promised her that we would meet the queen hand in hand
how can i go through with it ?
the glitter the music the dancing
and what to all the congratulations
if it were possible for you to stay i would advise it
but you cannot break faith with her majesty
the queen would understand and pardon me
but you are right
i must go
when she wakes give her this
it 's all very astonishing
they say the queen is delighted with her new title empress of india
and how disraeli swayed the house when he announced the new title
even gladstone was delighted
oh father so you UNknown e come round to that at last
well there 's no use denying it now
i never denied his greatness
oh meyers on your legs again
thanks to you sir michael
so he told me
how fortunate you saw it in that light
glad to help you
he only arrived half an hour ago and had to come straight to UNknown street
mr meyers i 'm dreadfully anxious
nothing serious i hope
her absence tonight is such a horrible disappointment for him
of course of course
so is she
i trust so
i 'm horribly anxious
not even to meet the empress of india
her majesty is on her way
before she arrives i want to thank those men who have so splendidly stood at my side and made our enterprise successful
first there 's my friend mr hugh meyers
mr meyers concerning whose services i cannot speak too highly
next there 's sir michael UNknown at a moment of grave crisis he came to my aid against his shall i say prejudice
mr meyers sir michael UNknown it is my privilege to inform you that in recognition of your patriotic action your sovereign has bestowed a UNknown upon each of you
your grace is most kind
why didn 't you come earlier ?
well i had to see dizzy and get into this rig
my dear mr meyers
but this telegram has been waiting
charles i 'm frightened
you don 't mean
no risk no fortune !
speaking of fortune
oh poor child
alfred is going to make an important transaction
oh i know your husbands UNknown well enough !
count me out !
uncle alfred please let else come along to st moritz
shopping for st moritz
just imagine else mrs UNknown is traveling to st moritz too
miss else !
end of act one
disastrous price drop at the stock market !
today the stock exchange was shocked by a UNknown fall in prices which caused an unprecedented panic
dr ernst UNknown attorney and notary
dear UNknown we are waiting for weeks now to get the ward 's papers
there are rumors about your losses at the stock market
dear UNknown if we don 't get the papers within the next 24 hours we cannot avert the course of events
i will put things straight until tomorrow
end of act two act three
i 'm really sorry but we can 't grant you another credit
mister von UNknown is out of town
i don 't know when he will be back again
you UNknown your promise to restore your convertible bonds before this noon
in case you cannot arrange it immediately
i will have to call in the district attorney 's office respectfully dr UNknown

mister von UNknown
the restoration of this film was co UNknown by UNknown re within the UNknown of the media programme european community
this film was restored in UNknown by the royal belgian film archive from a black and white copy that came from UNknown switzerland
waterloo first act
the english fleet is paralyzed
moscow has been burned
his goal was to conquer the world !
but europe had a terrible awakening and a UNknown rejected the giant in a battle of nations near leipzig
napoleon was exiled to the island of UNknown
countess UNknown comes from vienna to introduce one of our faithful as a lackey in the congress
the winners meet in the congress in vienna to shape the new europe
the representative of france monsieur UNknown has the floor
let the UNknown have their freedom why must the people atone for the sins of their prince ?
UNknown UNknown UNknown !
or maybe you think all our sacrifices have been made in vain lord wellington ?
mr UNknown presents to his excellency
they are playing an odious game against us !
on behalf of my government i declare that prussia was forced to withdraw making congressional opposition
will you carry out your resolution even if it causes the UNknown of congress ?
leave immediately for UNknown
go quickly !
UNknown cher the UNknown at leipzig
hold your tongue you old rascal i know more about horses than you !
may the devil take this vienna congress we have taken a serious blow in this war merely to remove just a poor goat !
i will not participate further in this deception
i will present my resignation
and you have me all to yourself !
forward forward !
it is truly outrageous !
the devil take this congress of vienna !
UNknown i will submit my UNknown and we will get married !
his excellency field marshal UNknown cher asks the lieutenant to join him immediately !
your highness peace is a fact i hope and desire that your majesty can stop all the UNknown
now i feel the weight of years and i am not strong enough to start a new campaign
for these reasons i beg your
majesty to accept my resignation
and there have fun like the others !
i must go to vienna
sire a courier from vienna
about time !
the king should have my letter by now !
whatever you do do not regret it as you did with UNknown d UNknown !
do you still remember ?
what do you want ?
majesty i request UNknown in the prussian army !
i have submitted my resignation and that 's enough !
he will never be a good soldier !
i will not turn back
i shall have nothing more to do with the army
is general UNknown here ?
did you find accommodations in vienna ?
impossible to imagine without him
we should be happy to have him !
it will cost you a lot to find a room in vienna
it is full of foreigners !
but i would be very happy if you accepted one room in my apartment
end of the second act
can you dance lieutenant ?
i will provide you an invitation to prince UNknown 's ball !
but don 't just dance with me !
unaware of the events that were about to occur the couples were carried away by the beat of the music
vienna seems to have a particular attraction for you lieutenant !
we are two of your grenadiers from the old guard sire !
you know the art of leading a victorious army lord wellington but now if you also will show us that you know how to drive a UNknown !
napoleon has landed in france again the people welcomed him with enthusiasm !
napoleon has invited us to another dance and we cannot say no !
napoleon has escaped from UNknown !
you must come home quickly !
come with me to my country !
we do not want to live only for our happiness !
my place is with UNknown cher !
we will follow the prussian army
i want to be near him !
the bold stroke by the hand of napoleon had achieved what seemed impossible the congress of vienna was again to agree
to ensure world peace the allied states exile napoleon bonaparte and cut off communication with him anyone who will attack and kill him will be free from punishment !
general UNknown was sent to meet napoleon to insure his safety !
good morning comrades !
long live the emperor !
to paris now
end of the fourth act
we were formerly the l UNknown hunters and now we earn our bread as peasants !
advance my children we struggle anew against napoleon !
it was the turn of the UNknown
well schoolmaster you wish to fight against napoleon ?
this man does what he wants and if he thinks he cannot then he will not want to says UNknown !
is the old man up there ?
it is the king of whom i speak !
you will naturally lead the prussian army again marshal
nobody could do better !
and i will again make UNknown my chief of staff !
at this time the british army under the command of lord wellington crossed
belgium to meet the prussian army there
naturally remain in constant contact
then you should deploy your army at belle alliance and i will be at UNknown and one will come to the aid of the other if necessary !
do you know lieutenant UNknown ?
of course he was with UNknown cher before UNknown !
napoleon has broken through our lines with his guard our troops are UNknown !
forward cowards !
care excellency the french are down there !
when evening fell napoleon had won the UNknown prussian army UNknown under shelter of night near the town of UNknown
do not cut my boots otherwise i would have to get new ones and we do not have very many in store !
excellency i have to take care of your injured leg !
i UNknown l spread ointment on your wound !
do not lose hope my children !
napoleon has fought many battles with us but we will return him to his homeland !
why did you not write me from vienna ?
per general UNknown 's orders no foreigner may pass through the village !
general UNknown knows me
a countess UNknown wants to speak with you
i wanted to go to england but your orders prevent me !
whether you wish it or not you are required to put me up here for the night !
unfortunately we cannot be of aid countess
we have no place for you !
if you want to take advantage of my small room
take madame to my room
end of the sixth act
so charming and so dumb !
general UNknown reports the enemy presses us from the rear the guard is becoming weaker
we must go to the aid of wellington !
my dear wellington !
resist his attacks as best you can
you can count on our help
i am going to meet with fritz !
i must take an order to wellington !
you must cross enemy lines via the shortest path
show me the dispatch to be taken to the duke of wellington !
the seal has been tampered with !
who else has had the letter in their hands ?
then only you can be the traitor !
the sword !
as quickly as possible to the duke of wellington !
hurry we must go !
you did not do such a thing !
french perfume !
no one other than my fiancee !
lieutenant UNknown knows you wrote this ?
UNknown save me !
a prussian !
father UNknown cher lieutenant UNknown has been killed
this order must go to wellington immediately if i have to take it to him myself !
i UNknown l take it all the way to the end !
wellington justified his nickname of the iron duke for even in moments of greatest danger he remained UNknown calm !
napoleon makes a forced march on waterloo
we do not want to scare the ladies !
at midnight we will leave without attracting attention !
i hope to return as your morning guest !
the english are getting weaker victory is ours !
our losses are huge my lord we have lost almost half of the troops !
i will not turn back !
it will be useless
give the order to retreat !
UNknown cher is coming we are remaining !
end of the ninth act
do you want me to be a liar ?
i would like for darkness or the prussians to come !
the whole forest is UNknown with prussians
UNknown cher is there !
form up the lines !
long live the emperor !
now forward boys forward !
majesty the guard is UNknown !
it 's over !
we have won !

that 's one of uncle UNknown 's brats !
he 's charles UNknown !
charles UNknown nothing !
then un christen him !
un christen this child or you UNknown l not get another nickel out of me !
that 's my son in a blanket i UNknown e never seen before !
that 's my baby !
parson something 's got to be done about this
a most distressing and UNknown occurrence !
it UNknown l be bad if they find out it was us !
some ornery pole cat done this !
well who was it ?
i UNknown l brand the critter that did this !
he ought to be strung up !
don 't worry steve
the fun 's all over
i 'm gonna be leaving before something does happen !
what 's that on steve 's pants ?
land sakes !
he 's the pole cat that did it !
go get him !
now that steve 's gone can i see you home ?
i saw you plant that cap on steve !
aren 't you ashamed of yourself ?
treating those poor babies that way !
well you see i heard some of them were female so i had them introduced all around !
i think your conduct is disgraceful !
i suppose you 'r e proud of yourself playing a trick on those poor mothers !
i suppose you call yourself a grown up responsible man !
you act like a child !
is that all you have to say for yourself ?
i don 't think you 'r e a bit funny !
now that 's the right pitch
you were way off key last time
now all together
now let 's hear you by yourself
alright and you
i told you i 'd go riding with you after school !
i was just helping so you 'd get finished quicker !
i 'm afraid that herd of yours is about to stampede !
sounds like it !
that 's enough !
school 's dismissed !
what is it ?
and he gave me more trouble than you did !
i UNknown l change into my riding clothes
don 't go do me a favor and go just as you are
i 'm sure the host won 't mind and i sure like that dress !
what are you laughing about now ?
her name is sir henry but i call him hank for short
you haven 't told me about the book i lent you did you finish it ?
that romeo and juliette ?
yes ma 'a m i finished it !
don 't tell me you didn 't like it !
soon it UNknown l be as easy as reading the patent medicine catalog
didn 't you like the story ?
they raised a strange breed of men in those days
romeo was a pretty good UNknown
he had his enemies and he killed them
he wasn 't a coward and he was quick on the draw
you approve of killing your enemies ?
an eye for an eye ?
not if there 's another way out
but them enemies were ornery
they had it coming to them !
what else ?
i didn 't like him in that balcony scene !
the balcony scene ?
maybe so but not for me
what 's the idea traipsing up that rope and ladder ?
he wanted to talk to her !
why didn 't he go in through the front door ?
don 't you understand ?
their families were enemies !
exactly so !
what would you do ?
go in and kill her father ?
that would be nice
but i would have a showdown with him !
if he was too stubborn to call off that feud
i would have grabbed juliet off that balcony and married her !
that 's just what he was planning to do !
well what was he fooling around about ?
he loved juliet
why didn 't he get to going ?
men in those days realized how much women loved the gallantry of courtship
yes i know
wasted so much valuable time it got them both killed
if i loved a gal and wanted her and knew i could take care of her
not in the words of romeo but in the feeling inside
do you think i 'd let that gulf stand between us ?
messing around with rope ladders making up poetry ?
no you 'r e hardly a romeo
what would you do ?
you 'r e just as sure of yourself as ever aren 't you ?
molly don 't play act with me
we don 't fool each other
we ain 't on no balcony !
don 't you think the spring is the prettiest time to get married ?
but i don 't want to get married yet !
i UNknown e got my school and i 'm just getting started !
that ain 't no real woman 's job in life
not if you 'd be my wife and partner
what i aim to do i 'm pushing farther west to utah or nevada
to do out there just what judge henry done here in wyoming
make more united states out of raw prairie land !
i like you and i admire you more than any man i UNknown e ever known
but i 'm not sure of myself yet
this country 's so new and strange
i feel like an alien
women are funny molly
oh yes you do !
but i 'm glad you think you don 't !
what is it ?
come on horse !
hello steve !
oh just kinda drifting around
i UNknown e just been putting a UNknown on a couple of strays
yes so i noticed
you UNknown e been putting UNknown brand on somebody else 's calves
aw what 's a few calves to a man who 's got thousands ?
i 'm sick of nurse UNknown someone else 's cows around for no more than enough to keep you in smoking tobacco
don 't talk that way steve
you and i done a lot of loco things together
but some things are not only loco they are plumb wrong !
you take life too seriously !
this whole country 's taking things more seriously !
i ain 't trying to lecture you or play sunday on what 's right or wrong
the ranchers are sick of having their herds trimmed out !
there will soon be UNknown out with ropes on theirs UNknown
times are changing
well i 'm carrying a nice UNknown rope to make it easy for them
if they catch me !
you hard headed fool !
what are you going to do ?
turn me in ?
i couldn 't be sore at you no matter what you did
but listen you and i have been friends too long to find ourselves on opposite sides
don 't put me in any hole like that
aw shucks !
this country 's getting too civilized too solemn
i UNknown e got a notion i UNknown l be UNknown out
gold fields or somewhere
you can stay on here as long as you want
there they go steve !
right on time !
hard work but easy UNknown !
you lazy son of a gun !
you got it all straight haven 't you ?
leave at least 100 head of the sorry critters on the bank
in case anybody 's trailing us they UNknown l think we got scared and left them
we UNknown l swim the rest down the river
don 't let a hoof touch the shore until they hit the rocks at boulder creek
they won 't leave any tracks
you got to pay a little for safety !
throw away one grab two !
always play UNknown
remember that !
i don 't think we UNknown l find hide or hair of them !
well you find any more UNknown ?
about 100 head so far
this country 's just full of stolen cattle and ain 't a cow thief in sight !
looks like they got UNknown and dumped the whole herd
yeah and they UNknown l get them out of the country !
we never will know who they are !
no one can find then in them blind canyons !
reckon we 'r e licked boys !
lucky to get any cattle back
yeah you found all of your cattle except 200 head of your best beef !
we will never find the rest of them ?
you know you ain 't found nothing but UNknown !
they must have gone someplace !
them cows can 't fly !
and a UNknown good thing they can 't !
boys we 'r e plain out UNknown !
they UNknown them cows downstream
and i bet you that we will pick up those tracks on the other side of lava gap
boulder creek ?
we may find then before nightfall
i UNknown l pick up the rest of the bunch and we UNknown l get started
by gosh i believe he 's right !
you can bet he 's right !
and what 's more
he 's cuter than a mountain goat in springtime !
he ain 't no smarter than that virginia boy !
that boy 's so smart he 'd dry snow and sell it for sugar !
come on boys !
200 head worth more than 75 apiece
better than UNknown cows for a living !
where do you think we are now ?
in some swell new york hotel ?
we soon will be about 2 months from now !
let that fire be !
do you want to let someone know we 'r e here ?
when i want a fire i 'm going to have it !
if anyone 's following us they are 40 miles back !
yeah hunting cow tracks under the water !
well i 'm going to go see how greasy 's doing night UNknown them critters
what 's the matter jim ?
it 's alright for UNknown to talk i UNknown l be glad when we get rid of them cows !
what if they do catch you ?
you can only die one time !
what do you want ?
live to be 100 ?
what 's life anyway ?
a few winters waiting for spring
a few summers wishing they 'd last
two bottles of whiskey and a half dozen girls you can remember
then you 'r e 6 by 3 feet under the ground and that 's all !
might as well be now as later !
greasy they will settle down
i UNknown l send one of the other boys to help you !
we better warn them !
no you go your way and i UNknown l go mine !
now that he 's found them what 's biting him anyway ?
i don 't know but he 's sure bothered about something !
boys we 'r e going to split into 3 parties and close in on them
foster take your boys down by the creek
you boys come with me
the moon 's too bright
i don 't like that either
if they couldn 't set us by sunlight they ain 't gonna get us by moonlight !
i wish i was in jackson hole right now !
for god 's sake !
can 't you get that frown off your face ?
think of something cheerful !
your girl or a cold bottle of beer !
play on that harmonica i loaned you !
get them up boys !
get their guns honey !
boys where 's your calling card ?
we left them in the deck !
thanks for the UNknown pedro !
it was real entertaining !
i knew something like this was going to happen
where 's UNknown and the rest ?
you got us all wrong
only us 3 on a little hunting trip
well then you must have been drinking your coffee with a cup in each hand !
tie them up boys
found another one boys !
howdy boys !
found the cattle down in the ravine
whoever was night UNknown them ducked
tie him up ?
smelled it right across wyoming !
i told you !
you got 4 of us
ain 't that enough for one gathering ?
not by a long sight !
what do we do with them ?
hang them now ?
maybe we UNknown l catch the rest of them
come on boys
any of you fellows got the makings ?
well she 's breaking
boys ought to be showing up anytime now
wouldn 't look for them until morning
when are you going to do this thing ?
sunup i reckon
thought you 'd lost our trail
you can 't beat that doubling back in the water !
i learned that trick off an indian
funny how you pick up a thing ain 't it ?
you never know when it 's going to come in handy !
dollar and a half you owe me pedro !
i UNknown l be glad when this is all over with
it ain 't over for me !
i 'm heading for the UNknown
and i 'm hunting UNknown until i find him !
here 's some of the boys now !
we ain 't caught hide nor hair of any of them boss !
i told you there wasn 't any more of us !
come on let 's get this thing over with !
it 's a pity to waste that loyalty on a skunk like UNknown !
come on boys !
come on !
please i don 't want to die !
aw shut up jim !
take your medicine with grace !
ask him for a drink
maybe that will help you
don 't forget to wind it keep the stem side up and it UNknown l always run
it 's good for 4 in any regular saloon
thank you steve
got a pencil ?
you got my gun ain 't you honey ?
i want you to keep it with this
and give it to him
after it 's all over
i wish it was UNknown instead of you steve
i don 't want to die !
alright bring them on boys
you boys got anything to say ?
you don 't want to say anything ?
steve wanted to you to have this
there 's a note inside the holster
sure is a lot of quail this season
be quiet you son of a gun !
you UNknown l get me shot someday !
how is he ?
he belongs in a hospital !
school UNknown 's house ain 't no place for him !
what 'd they bring him here for anyway ?
his horse brung him here !
funny ain 't it ?
no it ain 't funny !
he 's been hanging around here so much the horse thought he was home !
here you are at last !
where 'd you have to get that medicine ?
a saloon ?
about time you showed up honey !
if we had to depend on you he 'd be dead already !
don 't scold him mrs taylor
it 's a long way to town
you boys have been just wonderful !
if it hadn 't been for you miss molly i reckon we 'd have lost him
you wait outside with the other boys !
i UNknown l be wanting to use you later !
you quit your worrying dearie
he 's coming along fine !
why don 't you close your school this afternoon so you can get some rest ?
you UNknown e been here every minute that you ain 't teaching !
and you ain 't had the right kind of sleep since he 's been sick
i 'm alright !
i know better !
except me !
thank you boys
i thought it was funny he hadn 't been around !
if you see him tell him his gun is here
he must have borrowed it from steve before he got shot
i UNknown l sure tell him if i run across him !
gosh honey !
i wish i had a woman that thought as much of me as she does of him !
come on !
what are you children doing ?
we 'r e playing rustler !
that guy 's a cattle thief and we 'r e lynching him !
you can 't play like this !
you might hurt each other !
he said he would !
he said he 'd be steve !
he didn 't whimper at all !
steve strung up ?
judge henry 's foreman had to string him up because he was stealing cattle !
you mean hanged him ?
who told you that ?
then it is true !
you might as well know
don 't know why you weren 't told in the first place
steve was strung up with the rest of them cattle thieves
did he do it ?
somebody had to do it !
he was in charge and it had to be done !
that 's our kind of law !
don 't you realize that 's murder !
no use talking about it
crimes are UNknown different in different countries
out here stealing 's the meanest lowest thing a man can do !
that doesn 't justify killing !
and steve was his friend
it ain 't a question of friends or enemies it 's a question of right and wrong !
if we didn 't hold a rope and a gun over them outlaws you couldn 't teach at all !
our lives wouldn 't be worth nothing !
do you think i UNknown l teach my children that ?
teach a new generation to approve of murder ?
where you come from they have policemen and courts and jails to enforce the law
here we got nothing
do you think it was easy for him to have to hang a friend ?
it was harder for him to do it than for us to bear it !
and there he is !
because of UNknown someone took a shot at him !
and you can 't tell me it was indians !
i suppose this country 's destroyed every human feeling in you and in him
i suppose in time i 'd feel that way too
but i won 't !
then why don 't you go back where you come from ?
i will as soon as he 's well !
i won 't stay here any longer !
alright go on back home !
you don 't belong here !
we don 't want your kind !
go back east where the living is soft and easy !
sit on silk cushions and get hired girls to wait on you and drink your pink tea !
when i married taylor i drove an ox team 1000 miles to this very spot !
i fought indians with my father 's rifle and him lying dead across my knee !
i killed a sioux squaw with her own axe !
and you were talking
men or women !
and i will say good riddance !
now you listen to me !
my people built a country in new england too
and they fought and died just as bravely as you UNknown !
do you think you 'r e the only people who ever fought indians ?
did you ever hear of the cherry valley massacre ?
my grandfather stark was killed at cherry valley !
and my grandmother walked 90 miles on foot to get help to save the survivors !
don 't tell me i can 't do anything when it 's got to be done !
i can stand anything you can and more !
i 'm not going away !
i 'm going to stay here and look after him !
and now you get out of here !
get out !
i warned you steve
it 's alright darling
let 's never talk about it
never let it come between us
forget it ever happened
i think romeo was a mangy UNknown !
shut up that rotten noise !
set up another round joe !
you know what i want !
town 's full of mangy cowboys !
what 's up ?
him huh ?
i remember something about him being shot a while ago
indians wasn 't it ?
no somebody plugged him in the back !
hello sweetheart !
you said 5 o UNknown lock and here i am !
senorita and i are going to go get some flapjacks
after that we UNknown l be back at the bar for some more punishment !
did you see who i saw ?
yeah the mangy cow thief !
looks like bad news to me !
when 's it going to be ?
ain 't never seen a bishop !
what 's a bishop look like ?
like an ordinary shoe drummer
except he wears half his clothes backwards !
howdy miss wood !
won 't be miss wood this time tomorrow !
you look pretty as a picture !
much prettier than that girl on the pride of iowa can of corn !
where 's ma dad taylor ?
they will be along soon
i UNknown l get everything ready
howdy miss molly !
we UNknown e been waiting all morning !
i didn 't expect you so soon !
they got something planned !
i can see it in their faces
howdy boys !
could we borrow him for a spell ?
can i trust you ?
we UNknown l be good pretty good !
not too good !
not one of them !
i UNknown l trust all of you
i 'm going upstairs now and you can drink all you please !
sure thing !
you don 't mind me going with them ?
of course not !
it won 't be long
anyhow the UNknown will be along soon
we will have plenty of time alone where we 'r e going
i hope you UNknown l never be sorry !
hope i UNknown l always be able to make you happy
and keep you happy
now run along
the boys brought you things and they 'r e all upstairs
hello boys !
much obliged to you boys !
i didn 't know UNknown was in town
he 's heading for more trouble
talking plenty and drinking more !
well boys my last drink with you single !
well fire and fall back boys !
someday maybe i UNknown l step off too !
here 's luck !
did he mention he was a friend of mine ?
he said plenty about you !
what i hear goes in one ear and out the other
hot weather ain 't it ?
that friend of yours said he 'd drop in again in case you 'r e interested
well it ain 't !
let 's have another drink !
hey did you get what you were hunting in the UNknown last fall ?
yeah sheep was thick in the UNknown all year
UNknown claims different
save you the trouble !
just say the word !
i 'm hoping he don 't drift around
but a fellow don 't get married every day !
you UNknown e got to think of her !
who else am i thinking of ?
i 'm acting mayor of this town and i UNknown l put him in jail !
until you get married anyway
joe 's place is getting pretty crummy all of a sudden !
set up a round !
cow hands drinking their mangy wages
somebody left the door open and the wind blew in !
aw come here UNknown !
let 's drink to the bride and groom !
get good and UNknown for the wedding !
i heard the only way a man can get shot in the back is by running away !
say you i 'm a friend of UNknown
you know what UNknown claims about your affair down in the UNknown that you run from a rustler with your tail between your legs !
feller if you wasn 't drinking you might wake up and find yourself seriously dead !
come on joe
i 'm having a showdown with you here and now !
i don 't want ruckus here !
shut up and keep out of this !
it 's you i 'm talking to !
UNknown i 'm trying not to have any trouble with you just now !
you UNknown e been dodging it for 5 years !
you tried to stay out of my way !
i UNknown e got you UNknown now and i 'm calling your hand !
you lying white livered skunk !
this country ain 't big enough for both of us !
i 'm giving you until sundown to get out of town !
too bad you had to say that UNknown !
get out !
boys if you UNknown l oblige me in this
sure we understand
i knew you 'd see it that way
we UNknown l see that nobody interferes
never thought UNknown had the guts !
i don 't want her to know until it 's all over
we ain 't saying nothing
she wouldn 't understand
sun will be down in half an hour
well he forced it on you so hurry and get it over with
yeah we want to get some fun out of this wedding too !
you ain 't worried are you ?
of course not !
who had to tell you about it ?
the woman downstairs
but i didn 't
i 'm sorry you had to be worried
it doesn 't matter
let 's don 't think about it
what will we do now ?
what now ?
i wish you didn 't have to wait alone but it won 't be for long
what do you mean ?
i did my best
if i hadn 't been thinking hard of you
i reckon i 'd have killed him then !
i gave him a chance to quit
but he had gone too far before the others
it UNknown l have to go on now
what are you going to do ?
i 'm not going to let him shoot me
we can go away !
it 's not too late !
you can go away and leave him here !
i UNknown e got to stay !
there 's something else !
there must be !
do you think i want to do this ?
i UNknown e tried to forgive the other killings
those cattle thieves and steve
i forced myself to think of it as you did
a public duty law and order !
but this this isn 't the same !
just to satisfy a personal grudge !
if folks came to think of me as a coward
i could never look them in the eye again
or you either
i don 't know what you call it but it 's something in the feelings of a man
down deep inside
if somebody said i was a thief i couldn 't let them go on saying it !
it wouldn 't matter what other people thought but i 'd have to know inside of me that i thought enough of my own honesty to fight for it !
then it will be like this always !
when will it ever end ?
there will always be killing to do until this country ain 't a meeting place for men like UNknown
then think of us !
you and me our life together !
that 's what i am thinking of !
your life has always been your own but now it isn 't !
you UNknown e given it to me !
don 't take it away !
when i think of tomorrow of you and me and of
if you do this there will be no tomorrow for you and me
don 't go !
it 's you your life !
i can 't let you !
give me room !
let 's go !
you ain 't finished your last drink yet greasy !
he 's got him !
he 's dead as a cold mackerel !
the key UNknown
you can come out now gents !
thank heavens it wasn 't you !
i love you so !

vice president 's office

reiko told me that he proposed to her
i thought reiko was joking again but she isn 't
he 's serious
he 's a wonderful man
i 'm worried about reiko getting married before you but
if we miss this chance she would never settle down
mother i don 't care who gets married first
is it okay to agree to their marriage then ?
from UNknown UNknown
there 's something i want to say urgently to you too
may i see you tonight ?
but i 'm quite serious about her
i want to marry your sister
do you still feel unwell ?
i 'd appreciate it if you talked to your mother
i 'i l tell her how sincere you are
and i won 't oppose either
let me go !
this is all wrong
i 'm okay
UNknown and i have to leave for our honeymoon
you two have a wonderful trip
mrs mizuno i 'i l take UNknown home while you see them off
is something bothering you ?
you can tell me anything that 's bothering you
i UNknown e always had my eye on you
but today watching you made me realize how much i adore you
if there 's anything i can do to help you i 'i l do anything to make you happy
you can trust me
mr UNknown please !
i owe you an apology
i 'm concerned about your sister 's health
it 's the first day of our honeymoon and you 'r e thinking about my sister and not me ?
i 'm sorry
we should lose ourselves in happiness
i 'm sorry about what happened
i need to speak to you about something
could you please make time for me ?
you needn 't be concerned
i saw your husband in the garden
i 'm not concerned about his whereabouts
i 'm sure you aren 't
i 'i l see you in the ballroom tonight
good morning mrs UNknown
can we go right now ?
as you wish ma 'a m
i 'i l arrange for a car immediately
last night i stayed awake thinking
and i concluded that i must be in love with you
i UNknown e never had a serious relationship with a woman UNknown i UNknown e always kept company with geisha girls
when i talk about being serious i mean i want you to marry me
as you know i 'm a widower with 3 children
and as you can see i 'm an old man
but my love for you is genuine
i 'm also wealthy enough to give you a good life
i 'm not saying that you 'd be attracted to my wealth but
i want you to know that everything would be yours
i can 't give you an answer yet
i 'm not asking you to merely replace my wife
i want to start my life again with you
i want your commitment
i wish i had a car like this
i would enjoy driving it
sorry to destroy your fantasy but i 'm not so rich
how boring !
i wish it had been a hudson
i think she 's spoiled
i hope you can talk some reason into her
is he supposed to be in UNknown with his family ?
maybe he 's in UNknown with geisha girls
that 's not true
he 's not the kind of man to lie
i drop my case
i dropped by to tell mr UNknown that we 'r e back
to UNknown mizuno c o UNknown corporation
from UNknown in UNknown
i UNknown e decided to stay here with them for a while
i 'm sorry that i 'm not coming back when i planned to
i know it 's a sudden offer but i wonder if you could come to UNknown
i think this is a good opportunity for you to be acquainted with my family
she wants you to go to UNknown as soon as you 'r e back home
i know you 'r e a kind and reliable man
i need to speak to you about something
UNknown guess what the good news is
UNknown wants to take us to a restaurant
come with us
why don 't you two go by yourselves ?
honey come up and help me persuade her !
go downstairs to talk
go and have fun
could you buy one of these for us ?
i don 't want it
UNknown wants to buy you something just this once
i really don 't want it
neither do i then
have i done something to offend you ?
i 'm convinced that you 'r e upset with me
do you remember the wedding ?
you treated me as if i was a villain
that incident made me realize something
it 's the letter you wrote me
i was foolish to think that it was about me marrying reiko
then what do you think it was about ?
why do you think i wanted to talk to you ?
i can only guess
are you suggesting that i got upset because you married reiko ?
why would i ?
i hope i didn 't offend you
having yourself a glamorous married life ?
you have no right to be ironic like that
do you think that i didn 't know that you were married with children ?
did you snoop around to find that out ?
how UNknown old fashioned
when you want somebody to go out with i 'm yours
it 's a nash
by getting married
it must be true
he must be rich and successful !
mr UNknown 's playing golf
he may not return for some time
i shall wait for him
we 'r e too tired to follow you uncle
let 's go back father
are you our new maid ?
because UNknown is on leave ?
are you leaving ?
why don 't you stay for a couple of days ?
there are many things to do
i was bored to death
that 's all
then i 'i l do my best no to bore you
i thought you were our new maid
because you were in the hallway
why weren 't you in the parlor ?
i 'm sorry i wasn 't here to greet you
i didn 't expect you so soon
at your company uncle what do women do ?
you know nothing about working women
there are some decent UNknown too
excuse me but what do tou do ?
ms mizuno is my secretary
a woman secretary ?
but i 'm really a typist
so there are decent UNknown like you
i don 't know what you mean by decent but i 'm proud of my job
i 'm not ashamed of anything
what does a typist do ?
makes a lot of noise
has mrs UNknown gone to her mother 's in UNknown ?
i guess i 'i l drop by too
i love you
don 't let a small thing bother you
who is he ?
look me in the eye
is he your lover or something ?
you 'r e insane to ask me about things i 'd done before i met you
shut up !
whatever you choose to do you should go to your mother 's
i was visiting a friend who lives around the corner
didn 't your sister drop by last night ?
reiko has left
can i tell to you about it ?
can you truly forgive her ?
it 's not a matter of me forgiving her or not
i married her
this is no place for you
you 'd better go home
and you 'r e coming with me
you 'd better mind your own business
i wish you 'd left me alone
she 's right
it was all my fault
your sister 's worried too
please change your mind and come home
i 'm not here to listen to your nonsense
i came back because i promised UNknown
now i have another engagement
mr UNknown loves you dearly
how selfish can you be ?
have you thought at all about mother and i ?
we want you to be happy
what you 'r e doing is ruining your own happiness
you 'r e tormenting mr UNknown and you 'r e making us very sad
this is going nowhere
UNknown asks me about my UNknown prior to our marriage
he 's the one who 's selfish
i will not put up with it
never in my whole life
reiko i beg you to come back !
don 't you know how hard this is for me ?
it 's pointless for us to speak anymore
i 'i l never change my ways
i 'i l live my life honestly
i 'm leaving on the UNknown UNknown in october
will you forgive my sister eventually ?
it won 't be socially acceptable for us to separate
so i 'm going abroad
i also wish to help you forget the way i treated you when i married your sister
but your leaving japan won 't solve the problem
i want you to ask reiko to continue living as mrs UNknown even UNknown
he 's a nice man
he really is a kind man
he visits me every weekend
where 's UNknown 's wife ?
they 'r e saying good bye privately
when you return reiko will welcome you back
and you will be mrs UNknown the next time i see you
i can 't guarantee you that
were you afraid ?
where the others go
there 's your sport !
my dear friend allow me to send this small gift to our very own 'm UNknown who won us so much money last night !
we will be expecting you today at 5 for tea
yours jacques mercier
you 'r e too lucky !
do you love him dearly ?
the lady does not feel very well
you UNknown e left me alone all evening
we UNknown e been here for so long
why don 't we leave ?
i don 't expect the ring will be worth very much
he 's still losing
the gentleman and i play as partners
we UNknown l split the winnings
were we not playing as partners ?
in your situation such UNknown is out of place
kind friend would you please drop by at 11 ?

but it 's my chauffeur who 's driving
how long has this chauffeur been working for you ?
only a week
resistance is useless !
but who are you ?
and where are we ?
a little word in your ear
but we don 't wish to stay here
watch out !
your rooms are on the top floor
but i repeat we want to return home
make no demands !
we 'd better do as she says
why must we ?
you bet !
leave her !
for how long ?
we want to leave
don 't let them take your UNknown e !
i am satan 's UNknown
the girl will sleep here
don 't leave me james !
don 't leave me alone !
she will sleep here !
it 's an order !
do as i tell you or you will learn how satan UNknown those who disobey his orders
but we want to go back home
but who is satan ?
he is the master !
look there !
satan has kept me prisoner here for many months without bread and without water
i 'm sorry to have frightened you
i UNknown e come to talk to your companion
but i don 't want to help satan
i serve satan and i have orders to take whatever there is in your right pocket
your father 's emerald !
this will do for satan 's collection of antiques
but it 's a very precious jewel and it belongs to eva 's father
give me the emerald
here people are distinguished by a number
you are number 741 and your companion is 742
your dinner is waiting in the adjoining room
i 'd rather have dinner at home
don 't move or i UNknown l kill you
take this key if you have the courage to leave this house before satan kills you all
follow the corridor until you reach room number 13 and tell whoever you find there that everything is ready
excuse me but i must return a moment to my room
you said room room number 13
end of part one
the maid has asked me to tell you that everything is ready
get out !
you UNknown e come here to trap me
but but the maid said
i believe that you recognize the faithful agents of satan
the explanation for your disappearance will be drawn up by us and UNknown to the newspapers
let me go !
satan will provide the due justification
sign this paper
call for the spider
if i sign can my can stay with me ?
take him away !
your life is in danger
the password ?
praise be to satan
return to your room
i am one of the UNknown brothers
praise be to satan
i must take you down here and no one at present can leave the house
didn 't you know it is forbidden to enter here masked ?
be seated !
come on cowards !
if i am discovered they UNknown l kill us both
i am professor moriarity
what have they done with eva ?
they have taken her to satan 's room
this is the spider 's room
satan 's is there
kill the traitors !
prisoners you will be saved if you can manage to climb the seven steps of the stairway of satan
if you guess the four true steps you will be immediately freed
for each false step you will remain one year in satan 's service
four false steps means death !
look at the UNknown !
they don 't deserve such generosity
i despise you all !
if you manage to escape death you will serve me in a matter of the greatest importance
i will do whatever you say if you let this girl go
the salvation of the girl is agreed
now the seven steps
your life is saved
very well !
when the young lady is freed
uncle joe !
in spite of all the world 's UNknown we do not know the truth
to know it we must add the precision of mechanics to our imperfect senses
the UNknown UNknown part artist part drunk part philosopher thinks he has discovered in cinematography
a sixth sense
life happy for some sad for others follows its indifferent course
being wealthy only in optimism
carlos was the only love and sole joy of carmen
whereas leon who never lacked for aught save happiness was an incorrigible pessimist whose misery contaminated all those UNknown him
you 'r e embarrassing me luisa !
stop UNknown about like that poor creature
they soon forget how to behave correctly
i UNknown l wear it my whole life
why has carlos so happy and le n so miserable ?
could UNknown answer this question ?
carmen 's father suddenly started UNknown the awful fact that he couldn 't afford to go to the bullfight
is that the patron saint of flying ?
and he had nothing to sell
a ring is a link joining together two lives
wear it always and we UNknown l stay together for ever
i won 't put up with this loose living any more
you 'r e off having fun while i 'm working
daddy i give you all i earn
what more do you want ?
what about me ?
didn 't give you all you are ?
all you 'r e worth ?
UNknown 's daughter is a good for nothing yet her father has plenty of money
is this ring worth anything ?
go and see how much you can get for it
if i go and sell it i UNknown l be late for my rehearsal
i UNknown l wait for you at the theatre
at the theatre where carmen works they 'r e ready to rehearse
where 's carmen ?
because of her we can 't rehearse
carmen has arrived
give us a smile
everything will work out
i should never have let you come here
you 'r e never going back to the theatre
i UNknown l work for both us
carlos and le n still have a different view of life
we UNknown l have another picnic tomorrow
you always see life through rose UNknown spectacles
and you 'r e always too gloomy
who 's right ?
you should listen to his advice
go and see him
carlos if you want to know the truth come
with this mechanical eye we shall find out the truth
it can see much deeper than we can
greater smaller faster slower
but i leave it to act for itself
and it UNknown with mathematical precision
you will see things differently
with our sixth sense
yesterday i snatched him from his mother
an interesting case of the UNknown of maternal love
she wanted him to go on working in the bank
she 's revealed herself to be a monster
we UNknown l have a good laugh when his mother comes
a simple optical illusion
that 's the true madrid without any literary UNknown
sixth sense part 4
it even feels refreshing !
i UNknown e seen some incredible things
without them knowing
we were hidden under a chair
is that carmen being given money ?
this is the scientific truth
now here comes the maternal monster
that 's how i want this phenomenon to be UNknown
what 's going on ?
here is the truth
that afternoon carmen had no idea how she was going to explain the business of the ring to carlos
and carlos ?
you 'd be better off forgetting about us
carlos if you want to know the truth come
do you like what i do ?
those barbaric stupid UNknown don 't interest me
it was he who told my UNknown what i did with the ring
what 's all this business about the ring ?
this is the laboratory of the truth
next time you should be more careful with the truth
i was right
UNknown has the proof
the truth hurts
a man prefers his own lies to the truth of others
i told carmen you didn 't want to see her
a pessimist is worse than a crook
you must be stupid to want to find the truth and crazy to show it
it 's all my fault about the ring
i wanted to go to the bullfight
we UNknown l put it down to force UNknown
the old and the new the general UNknown
film in 6 parts
we share the farm in two
we proceed to the sharing
that 's the way the farms grow poorer and collapse
one amongst others
we have to ask for one
we are not giving him
there 's no way !
there 's no way living
we can 't live only for ourselves
we have to unite our forces
the proposition of UNknown about the creation of a dairy cooperative
our taxes are not enough ?
now you want our last cows !
another trick from the soviets !
the local UNknown
who 's for it ?
i declare the dairy cooperative officially started !
dairy cooperative the october way
with the first profit !
don 't even think of distributing the money of the cooperative !
but it 's going to be lost money !
give back this money !
what will you do with it ?
just drinking !
how are we going to set up the UNknown cooperative ?
i 'm going to watch over the money and we will have that bull !
you think it 's a dream ?
from a temple of the industry
from a huge factory
in the sponsored village
the UNknown builds a common stable
we have to extend the farm
we have to work the land together with a tractor
it 's about time !
the old ones UNknown
look at my hands !
UNknown we get used to worked together
we sorted out the seeds
preparations for the wedding
i 'm catching up on you !
if only we could have a machine !
following your request
once overhead as above mentioned has been paid the tractor will be delivered to the cooperative
everybody expressed such an eagerness
we can not grant you a loan before your fields have been UNknown
we advise you to apply to the authority concerned
with our kindest regards
less political chatter !
to ask for a tractor
we are going to be left without a tractor !
the cooperative fed UNknown
so the UNknown decided to harm
and they did
do not enter UNknown a UNknown
apply the general line
we have the order !
the order for the tractor !
thanks to the workers !
company of UNknown
it 's done !
he is still alive !
the sponsors speech
let 's show what we can do !
meanwhile the young communists
on a collective land !
together with the industry !
hurrah for the land !

i manage to round up a coin every month
so that 's where all your spare cash goes
no wonder you didn 't have 100 bucks to loan me monday

drop it in some bookie 's lap
well i 'm not thinking of myself so much now see ?
but you oughta be sore if i go away

but it takes plenty of jack as well as talent to make the grade
i got plenty of both i guess
speaking of that how about that act of ours you said the keith office was interested in ?
there you are you see ?
that 's gonna cost about 1200 to mount

i knew that was coming
hawk it eh ?
hawk that new overcoat you got me too i suppose

i UNknown l get her a job outside some place
okay kitty just so long as she holds up our own name
now you sit right down here and write her a little letter

and believe me she sure knows her stuff
that swedish movement of hers has been laying UNknown m in the aisles ever since i was a pup
swedish movement ?
and boy she packs the meanest strip and UNknown routine that ever burned a verona way
you know what i mean

instead of hanging around this dump why don 't you grab the lexington ave local and go up and catch the show ?
do you really think i could ?
but my kid brother slim he UNknown l take you

oh don 't jump
did you hear that ?
suppose that was for you huh ?
everybody in the whole damn house clapping and yelling

but that 's what comes from not knowing what it 's all about
please mr nelson
i wanna be your pal see ?
and if you listen to me you UNknown l let me learn you a couple of dance routines to put you in the show
no thank you
but you UNknown e got the makings of a great artist
with your looks and my training it 's broadway for you no foolin

that 's the finale
open up your eyes and open up your lips
why don 't you try to get some sleep precious ?
i can 't

i don 't know
tell mother what 's the matter
everything is so different from what i thought it would be
but ain 't you glad to be back with me again ?
yes mommy darling but
but new york 's too big dirty and noisy
and your theater with all those men and the girls with no clothes on
oh i suppose it does seem queer to you
coming from a place where they cover everything but their noses
but things ain 't as bad as that
it ain 't what you do so much
it 's what you are
that 's it
why there 's a couple of dames in this troupe good at things you 'd never expect to see even if they do make their living shaking
i ain 't ashamed of it
you shouldn 't be ashamed of me neither
oh mommy i 'm not ashamed of you
let me tell you something april baby
if it wasn 't for the dough i UNknown e been piling up that way in the last 10 or 12 years you would never have been to no convent
i 'm just beginning to realize that
all these things you UNknown e gone through and i never knew
dancing with those girls
saying awful things

i got other plans for her
there you go again
i mean here we are jumping to buffalo with that and from there well who knows ?

so are you planning on leaving her alone here ?
the kid 's got a real chance in burlesque
don 't you see that ?
she 's got youth looks the whole works
she comes by it naturally
i can make her one of the biggest bets in show business
but she don 't wanna be in show business
she said she hates it
how does a kid like that know what she wants ?
now listen kitty
i 'm not gonna get married unless i 'm gonna be the boss
and if i 'm gonna be the boss i say the kid is going into show
that 's final
i 'm trying to do the best all around

now you 'r e talking
say you 'r e nice
you don 't look like a show girl
maybe i shouldn 't have mentioned it
no kidding i like you
and i guess you 'r e not so bad yourself
come on wisconsin
just looking for somebody to talk to
sailors don 't generally have much trouble finding company
oh i don 't want the kind of company you mean
listen all sailors ain 't a bunch of bums
but you got no idea how tough it is to be all alone and lonesome in a city like this
maybe i have
so what 's your name anyway ?
i UNknown e been so excited about finding you i forgot to ask
i don 't know though
it sorta fits you
just like i bet you are
oh you say the same thing to every girl you meet
how could i ?
what 's your name ?
sounds like a white UNknown
oh no i think tony 's a nice name
you do ?
gee but your eyes are blue
eat your chocolate cake
she didn 't ?
they 'd come down over the UNknown crash
and the ship would shake like it was gonna split in two
one big wave after the other
boy all night we didn 't know if we was gonna weather it or not
well anyway next morning the sun was shining the ocean was as smooth as glass
and right up the starboard was the coast of china
it must be wonderful to sail all over the world that way
oh i don 't know
you get tired of it just like anything else
i got a week to make up my mind if i 'm gonna enlist again
i suppose i will
here you are
just when we were getting acquainted
can 't we find some other place ?
but it 's pretty late
i know just the place
it 's nice and cool too
what do you care ?
my mother will be worried
i do have to sleep some time
they have rehearsal at eleven
well i won 't get much sleep tonight
it 's too hot to sleep
i mean i UNknown l be thinking about you
look at that city over there
it 's sort of like a dream too isn 't it ?
just as if we 'd never met at all
say don 't kid yourself
i 'm gonna camp right on your doorstep the rest of the time i 'm on leave
how long is that ?
a tanker going out with the tide
ships have to go out with the tide don 't they ?
and sailors have to go with their ships
and the world is full of other rivers and bridges with girls to sit on them till the tide goes out
oh april i 'm not like the rest of those gobs
sometimes i think there are people who were just meant to be lonesome
you know and then they UNknown l meet someone for a little while and it gives them something to remember
so their UNknown doesn 't hurt so much for a while
i don 't know how to say what i mean
yes but if those people meet the right people they get together for keeps
then they ain 't lonesome anymore
but the right people don 't seem to find each other very often
yeah ain 't it the truth
i don 't want to but i UNknown e got to
just don 't stop breathing
looks like i just can 't let you go
i UNknown e really got to go now
hello sailor boy
well young lady where do you think you UNknown e been ?

i should wave my handkerchief
what are you laughing at ?
well april i 'm not going back to my ship

oh i thought for a minute you were serious
it 's all decided
because if you don 't i UNknown l jump right off this roof

a younger woman ?
she 's ideal
she 's got a swell figure and a pair of legs that
why she 's got more sex appeal than
for a dame you couldn 't stand the sight of a few days ago you seem to be taking a big interest in april and her sex appeal

i 'm not letting any cheap comic tell me how to run my affairs
cheap comic eh ?

being born on the stage and all well getting married and leaving it seems to be giving up everything
you told me the other night you wanted to get out of the show business
that 's how i thought i felt
when i come right down to it i just can 't that 's all
you UNknown l never know tony what it feels like to be on the other side of those footlights and to hear them clap and clap for you
it does something to a girl
i don 't know what

after all i 'm young
people tell me i 'm pretty
here i UNknown e got a big chance
i might be a star
now i ask you tony what girl wouldn 't grab at the chance to land on broadway in a big show ?

tony don 't look at me like that
makes me feel terrible
you think of jumping into something and giving up a whole career
well tony you ought to understand
just the same
why we might even still be engaged

so far as i 'm concerned kitty darling 's finished

but also a land of UNknown industrial and commercial activity
and of great agricultural richness
and a young girl on her way to collect an inheritance from an uncle in algiers
pierre UNknown the big spender
liked a lot claudin UNknown who was about to inherit
manuel UNknown and his sister diane
UNknown 's cousins were firmly counting on the inheritance
sometimes one is happy to meet old friends from the regiment ;
pierre was thrilled to meet UNknown
no way you 'r e staying at a hotel !
you 'r e staying with me
the UNknown family 's lawyer
and i appoint as sole UNknown my niece UNknown
your old uncle didn 't forget you
he has paid your debts
miss you 'r e UNknown a villa at UNknown UNknown
and in the south a large UNknown
since the car now belongs to you you can do the driving
i wish the voyage would have
lasted another hour ; i was in love
to think that i will never see her again !
pierre UNknown had agreed to temporarily stay with his friend UNknown
i 'm starting to think that one doesn 't necessarily have to be a sucker to get married
as for money matters
he 's the reason why i 'm coming to UNknown
christian UNknown is rich but he 's of an odd sort
you may end up being disappointed
i was two years old when he saw me last
he 's kept an fond memory of me
at UNknown UNknown the villa that UNknown UNknown had inherited
christian UNknown pierre 's uncle had come to UNknown as a poor man
now he had become one of the richest farmers of the region
the UNknown farm is here right ?
tell me my good man do you know christian UNknown ?
dinner time at the UNknown farm
hold your appetite !
why on earth are you dressed as a waiter ?
meanwhile in UNknown UNknown 's villa
why are you drinking like that ?
do you have those 72 000 francs that i owe ?
there is a way to get that money
but you don 't have any UNknown !
oh if i was only a man
madam is served
the next morning christian UNknown had decided he would have his nephew see his UNknown
so lazybones you still think you are in paris ?
we 'r e going to watch the UNknown so don 't put on a UNknown
let 's go
it seemed a simple thing to ask
christian UNknown for money from afar
in person it seemed different
how much ?
do you have any idea how much work it takes us to raise a hundred thousand francs ?
a hundred years ago our UNknown found nothing but UNknown here
before it was transformed into fertile soil ; thousands of settlers died during the effort
while they were here our grandfathers needed better roads
that 's why we were waiting for you to turn up son
it was here at UNknown UNknown that the french troops UNknown in UNknown
you will have your hundred thousand francs but on one condition
that you spend six months working here in order to learn the value of hard labor
there 's a shortage on labor in UNknown they say
what a lovely day !
UNknown i have to speak with my uncle
i must talk to him right away !
what fair weather !
and with whom ?
a woman passes by and you are ready to go
because you will follow her to paris as soon as she has sold the property right ?
and i thought that i had found a son in you
what will become of me ?
UNknown UNknown had decided to go visit the UNknown that she owned in the south
pierre had apparently abandoned his projects
i come to say goodbye i 'm
leaving for the south tomorrow
UNknown UNknown left yesterday
you are buying sheep ; UNknown is selling just that on his farm
he 's leaving tonight
in the meantime UNknown arrived at the estate inherited from her uncle
estate for sale
we put it on sale at our uncle 's death
we thought that we were doing the right thing
UNknown UNknown is the one that you need to ask for instructions
the estate belongs to her
UNknown was taken with her new domain
she discovered unknown UNknown thanks to the UNknown ahmed
to think that the domain would be ours if it wasn 't for that girl
still we can do nothing to her
at UNknown 's place
can 't you invite my uncle and UNknown ?
i want them to get acquainted
very good !
i would gladly spend my whole life here
i hope that your cousins will do me the honor of joining the hunt as well
i would be glad to but my brother can 't
he 's busy that day
why don 't you want me to take part in the hunt ?
you probably have better things to do
that girl robbed us !
we should have gotten the inheritance
we will get it in the end !
what if i married UNknown ?
leaving for the hunt
you 'r e not UNknown out ?
you think you 'r e clever because you forced me into meeting that girl that i didn 't want to see
but that 's your driver
you brought him to the hunt ?
he 's an excellent beater
i even advice you to take him with you during the hunt
UNknown UNknown 's horse had taken the bit between its teeth
what a disgraceful thing we have done
this form of hunting is UNknown
if you are tired i can take you to the citadel miss
i 'm dying
i have done a UNknown
i am in a hopeless situation UNknown
only you can save me
you must marry me
i am prepared to do anything
i will kill you if i have to
by the palm grove
this kidnapping story is just another set up
you UNknown l have to choose between the girl and me
for the last time will you marry me or do you prefer to die ?
the UNknown UNknown went to block the road for the fugitives
sell me your UNknown
the horses are exhausted
make your falcon attack the UNknown !
where did the engaged couple go ?
look at that !

a straightforward boy
do you want me to find a good hiding place ?
you 'r e making funny faces

come with me
i want to go back home !
i want to go back !
this kid seems very nice
yes i know how to make the UNknown
but first you show me something
flattery is useless
you must take a lot of money when you go out
fed up of taking care of him the kidnapper is going back where he got him
show me the UNknown face again
you know i 'm a kidnapper

so here you have the UNknown side of the big city
and what can you win with the lot ?
