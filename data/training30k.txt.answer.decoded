my father is an elder god
and only they can bestow such a UNknown
your dad 's an elder god ?
funny how you failed to mention that before
if your father 's an elder god what does that make kahn ?
UNknown kahn is my brother
it was not my fault
i did everything you ordered
it was your job to lure them to an ambush
if they escaped then you failed me !
we could never have stopped them alone
listen to her
and you will be soon
you will mount a defense around my newest temple
prepare for UNknown to make one last attack
you said UNknown was no longer to be feared
i am to be feared !
for if you fail me now
i will feed your rotting corpse to the worms !
your hallowed position UNknown the worm pile appears to be most UNknown
now your failure will be my opportunity
man you got one UNknown family you know that
years ago my father decreed that his heir to the family throne must be strong enough to kill his own brother in battle if necessary
i beat my brother but i could not kill him
only one thing is certain
kahn must die
i could not then
you will do your best
it is all that can be expected
i will pray for you all
listen to me
i want to fight kahn but i don 't know if i 'm ready
you must believe in yourself liu
we believe in you
whatever time we have we must use well
are we really ready to die here ?
if we die we will die in battle
in less than one hour the merger of UNknown will be complete
father you alone have the power to end this
it is not weak to value life !
i offer you one final chance to return to my side UNknown
to rule all UNknown with your family
they are my family
UNknown UNknown !
my brother died a long time ago
his heart anyway
show them the way to oblivion !
mr ed is mine
leftovers are fine with me
yeah i 'm ma make you eat that thing
i can 't take too much more of this
is that all you got ?
is that any way to treat your mother ?
my mother 's dead
that just leaves you and me kahn
pathetic and weak
without your weapons you are no match for UNknown
UNknown help !
finally asked for help huh ?
whatever you are you will live to see the end of kahn to give my mother 's soul peace
face it liu kang
now i done seen everything
but not good enough
i warned you there would be consequences for breaking the sacred rules
but i did not expect this
must i do everything for you ?
the fate of the universe will be decided as it should be
ln mortal UNknown
i can and i will !
that was the longest week of my life
oh come on UNknown
could UNknown e been the last week of our lives
yeah i guess that 's right
what 's up with that ?
was i dead ?
you UNknown e become one of us
i will never forget this moment liu
you UNknown e all made me very proud
i will be watching you so stay out of trouble
and remember be there for one another
you 'r e a family now
adjusted to version
all UNknown air units a UNknown is in progress in the c 13 district UNknown newport city
UNknown over this area will be closed
UNknown over this area will be closed
we can fix it by UNknown it in our country
UNknown it ?
you don 't understand
originally the purpose of this project was to
major UNknown section 6 is in position and ready to move in
there 's a lot of noise in your brain
it 's my time of the month
don 't you think there 's going to be trouble if we interfere with a section 6 case
the target is a UNknown bad diplomat the best they can do is UNknown him
we 'r e the ones who get our hands dirty it 's time
let 's move to the rendezvous point
put your guns down !
i 'm entitled to diplomatic immunity
i want to talk to the person in charge
taking classified UNknown out of the country UNknown national security
we can also have you brought up on kidnapping charges so let him go
that 's not possible
my country has the right in accordance with international law to offer anyone protection and safe passage
the affidavit is at the embassy
i UNknown l send you a copy in a couple of days
are you sure ?
i 'm warning you to watch your comments
our country is a peace loving democracy
oh really ?
it 's about the secret talks scheduled with the gavel republic tomorrow
oh the official development assistance
the regime that took over gavel after the revolution demands financial aid supposedly for UNknown
they boast about democracy but they 'r e no better than the last lot
now they feel entitled to funds because of our past exploitation
well there 's a problem
the leader of the former junta that controlled their country is here seeking political asylum
you mean colonel UNknown correct ?
yes and that means we either deny gavel the funds and treat UNknown as a political refuge or help them and kick him out
it 's a tricky situation
my personal opinion is if we could find a politically acceptable reason
i 'd like to forcibly UNknown him immediately
by the way i want to thank you for your help with that other political asylum situation
nakamura from section 6 was also grateful
we diplomats must avoid messy situations you realize
what 's happened to the UNknown output
it 's normal i UNknown l switch to UNknown mode
the foreign minister 's interpreter
23 minutes ago her brain was hacked into through a phone line
foreign intelligence warned us about this
the puppet master has begun to UNknown UNknown throughout our network
we believe it 's extremely likely that he UNknown l target the secret talks scheduled with the republic of gavel
we UNknown e put everyone attending the talks under surveillance
i suspect once he hacked into her ghost he 'd use her to assassinate key delegates
so how long do we have before this UNknown breaks through her barrier program and reaches her ghost ?
roughly 2 hours
after that we UNknown l have to break the connection to avoid any danger
UNknown and UNknown are tracking the signal source from their car
we guess he or she is american but we have no clue about age sex or background
since last winter he 's been popping up in UNknown countries
he 's wanted for crimes including stock UNknown illegal information gathering political UNknown computer UNknown UNknown and is under suspicion for several other crimes
he 's on the international most wanted list
the nickname puppet master comes from the ghost UNknown
it 's the first time he 's appeared in this country
well if he 's so skilled how come he 's using an UNknown ha 3 virus ?
a more current technique would be harder to detect and trace but it might also arouse suspicion about colonel UNknown role in this affair
are you saying he 's using an old method just so no one suspects UNknown ?
or maybe UNknown is just a pawn used to make us think that
maybe there is another sponsor
now you 'r e stretching it
it 's not like you have any hard evidence
which reminds me
you should stop worrying about the UNknown UNknown up
i like my UNknown
since it 's my ass on the line out there use a UNknown
why did you transfer a guy like me from the police force ?
because we need a guy like you
you 'r e an honest cop who 's never stepped out of line and you 'r e a family man
except for the slight brain UNknown your body 's almost completely human
no matter how excellent identical standard systems have faults
what 's true for the group is also true for the individual
over specialize and you breed in weakness
it 's a slow death
that 's all
we 'r e already 40 seconds late !
i UNknown l be done in 5 seconds
it 's gonna be one of those days
you 'r e that desperate to find out your wife 's feelings you 'd ghost hack her ?
she hardly talks to me and all of a sudden she wants a divorce !
what 's worse my daughter UNknown me and got it into her head that i 'm the one cheating on her mom
how did you get your hands on a barrier breaker ?
from this really nice UNknown i met in a bar
he overheard my sob story
my wife 's lawyer stopped me from seeing her and my daughter
he showed me how to hack in from different places along the route without being traced
are you trying to kill yourself asshole ? !
looks like we 'r e not the only ones in a hurry round here
no one here !
we 'r e just wasting our time
don 't quit !
who wants to know ?
just answer me
yeah i saw the trash man making a call so i thought i had enough time to bring my garbage down
a trash truck ?
hq patch me into info from the sanitation department network
8 trucks are on duty in the surveillance area
the target is number 79 a type c vehicle
give me the wheel
follow them but take no action
we UNknown e got the data on the refuse connection points
they all UNknown to locations where we traced the calls
the target has now stopped at the next point
_ a 3 access confirmed
how do you think ?
ain 't no way i 'm gonna be your partner in crime
it 's pathetic
you must be kidding
my daughter is everything to me
i 'm not interested in crap like that
yeah vehicle 79 ah boss
what 's that ?
how would i know ?
they found out !
we 'r e gonna have to skip the next pickup
there 's no way they spotted me following them
they probably traced me when i UNknown the sanitation department network
next time use a back door
forget it just arrest them
you can drive now
he 's got high velocity bullets
they UNknown l go straight through your car door
UNknown ammo in a UNknown gun ?
he 's insane
keep on his tail
the breach and barrel are really screwed up
it 's no use arresting me i 'm not talkin to any damn cops !
can you remember your mother 's face or where you were born ?
do you have any childhood memories ?
do you remember anything ?
puppets without their ghosts are so pathetic
especially those covered in blood
we 'i i enter after the passengers have gone in
squad b comes in from the back the rest of you go in the front
saito get your men to UNknown all cars parked in front of the house
we UNknown e id 'd the man the major caught
so who is he ?
he claims to be UNknown gen fang age 28
with a record UNknown immigration law UNknown and illegal possession of firearms
he went into hiding at the end of last month
a member of a UNknown UNknown organization
about a week ago the military attached of the republic UNknown gavel 's embassy commissioned him to attack the UNknown secret meeting
and in reality ?
your basic thug
this guy 's just another puppet controlled by the puppet master
how 's UNknown doing ?
he 's back and UNknown that garbage collector with UNknown
so how about the puppet master ?
what 's he like ?
he 's like a puppet himself
squad b in position
ready and waiting sir
well all your memories about your wife daughter and divorce are false
like a dream
but that can 't be
i went to your home it 's a bachelor 's apartment
i told you
i checked the records
you UNknown e never had a wife or kid
your family only exists in your head
who do you see ?
it was a picture of my daughter
smiling like an angel
where did you meet your wife and when did you marry her ?
lf it 's all a lie when will i get my old memory back ?
UNknown with our current technology only 2 successful cases have ever been reported so i wouldn 't recommend trying to
i 'm sorry
the information that people UNknown in their life is just a drop in bucket
what 's a UNknown doing going diving in her spare time ?
how long have you been doing it ?
aren 't you afraid of the sea ?
what if the UNknown don 't work ?
i suppose i UNknown l die
or maybe you 'd save me
you don 't have to be here you know
you UNknown e done the underwater training course
i 'm not talking about a damn pool
i feel fear anxiety isolation and darkness
sometimes i feel hope
when i float back to the surface i imagine i 'm becoming someone else
it 's probably the UNknown
do you want to quit section 9 ?
how much of your body is original ?
are you drunk or something ?
no UNknown no hangover
man has an almost UNknown drive to realize any possible UNknown advances
who are we to complain ?
we haven 't signed our bodies and souls away to section 9
all UNknown that make up me as an individual
there are countless ingredients that make up the human body and mind
a face and voice to distinguish oneself from others the hand you see when you wake up your childhood memories and feelings about your future
and that 's not all
there 's also the ability to access vast amounts of information from an infinite network
all of that UNknown to create a mixture that forms me and gives rise to my conscience
at the same time though i feel continually confined within boundaries
so that 's the reason you risk your body diving in the sea !
what the hell can you see at the bottom in that darkness ?
now it 's like we 'r e looking through a mirror
and what we see is a dim image
was that you ?
visual UNknown are back on line
and its body functions ?
and its body functions ?
output is normal
i guess i UNknown l bring the UNknown up to speed
about 2 hours ago a UNknown cell at the UNknown factory in newport assembled a UNknown body on its own UNknown
when the UNknown arrived the body had already fled
we put out UNknown and initiated a UNknown search
a truck driver reported he 'd run over a naked woman on the highway
and the body was brought here
UNknown is contracted by the government
all their UNknown bodies are classified
we UNknown e a UNknown good enough to get past the best defenses but that 's not the only problem
of course there isn 't a human brain cell in its head but there appears to be a ghost present in its auxiliary brain
it resembles a ghost line that occurs when a real ghost is copied
but there 's no evidence of the UNknown that 's usually UNknown
in any case until we chart the ghost sector and dive into it we can 't be sure
i better get back to working on it
why not ?
consider all the UNknown UNknown devices that are crammed into that body
i wouldn 't be surprised if there were some sort of ghost in there too
as you 'r e new you don 't know but major UNknown 's body was also made by UNknown
not only her also parts of me UNknown and saito
we also receive regular UNknown maintenance from them
apart from you and the chief the whole section comes with a UNknown
that 's why we 'r e all so concerned with this case UNknown
what 's the logic here ?
theft isn 't the issue here
UNknown go with UNknown to the UNknown facility
UNknown the barriers are UNknown too
i 'm UNknown a barrier maze
tomorrow i UNknown l dive into that thing
is that safe ?
i have to see for myself what 's in there
don 't let anybody else in there !
what 's up with her ?
she 's been acting weird ever since this whole puppet master case started
it 's all in my report
don 't you read them ?
chief do you ever wonder about the UNknown who monkey around inside your brain ?
they undergo regular psychiatric UNknown
especially those in security are subjected to UNknown screening
of course the ones who check are only human
if you start wondering there 's no end to it
excuse me chief mr nakamura of the treaties bureau is here to see you
send him through
he 's nakamura the ministry of foreign affairs section 6 chief
never seen the other guy before though
well see you later
what 's on your mind ?
didn 't that robot remind you of me ?
of course not
what then ?
maybe i died a long time ago
and i 'm just an artificial product of a UNknown brain and synthetic body
or maybe there never was a real me in the first place
you UNknown e got human brain cells in that UNknown shell of yours and you 'r e treated like a human aren 't you ?
has anyone actually seen their own brain ?
the only thing that makes me feel human is the way i 'm treated
are you doubting your own ghost ?
what if a UNknown brain could generate its own ghost create a soul by itself ?
what could you base your belief in yourself on then ?
that 's bullshit
so check it out with your ghost !
we 'r e both busy men so let 's keep this short shall we ?
you UNknown l be relieved of any duties connected with this
the foreign minister 's approval
security whose official vehicles are in the basement parking lot ? according to the register a mr nakamura from the treaties bureau and a dr willis sir
get me the video records of their entrance
UNknown and UNknown
no there aren 't any UNknown in section 6 as they operate overseas
maintenance is difficult and there are diplomatic considerations too
then even if the other guy is a UNknown the 2 of them together couldn 't weigh over 1 ooo pounds
the pressure UNknown records
right there were two expensive looking cars but neither man looked like the type to drive
the security cameras show only 2 people
but remember how sensitive the UNknown on the entrance doors are ?
the doors took a full 3 second longer than usual to close after the 2 went in
and it is illegal to use UNknown UNknown inside UNknown facilities
it 's a serious violation of the national security act
section 6 must be up to something
are you ready ?
need i remind you that it 's an act of treason to withhold information from me that is relevant to this matter regardless of how classified it is
same goes for you
of course we have no objections to cooperating if there 's a good reason
dr willis ?
the sex of the UNknown is unknown and her is just a nickname the doctor gave it
allow me to introduce to you
this is the most extraordinary UNknown in the history of UNknown crime
the puppet master
since her appearance section 6 has taken a great interest and has been following the puppet master 's trail
we put together a project team headed by dr willis
they analyzed the data on the puppet master and this gave us an understanding of her UNknown and code patterns
ultimately this UNknown us to devise a strategy in which we lured her program into a designated body
you caused the puppet master to dive into a UNknown and then murdered her real body ?
yes that sums it up
she just happened to come to your country
she 's originally from america and they helped us capture her
that 's why we 'd like to take her back ourselves
i hope you have no objections
just another unidentified corpse
why are her UNknown on ?
why didn 't you say so before ?
all external controls are turned off
the body 's using its own power source i entered this body because i was unable to overcome section 6 's UNknown barriers
however what you are now UNknown is an act of my own free will
as a UNknown life form i hereby demand political asylum
a UNknown life form ?
life is like a UNknown point born in an overwhelming sea of information and life when organized into species UNknown upon genes to be its memory system
so man is an individual memory system only because of his UNknown memory
and a memory cannot be UNknown but it UNknown mankind
when the UNknown of computers made the UNknown of memories possible you should have taken its meaning more seriously
proving it is impossible because modern science cannot explain what life is
who the hell is this ?
even if you do have a ghost we don 't offer freedom to criminals
you chose the wrong place to defect
time is always on my side i UNknown e now acquired the possibility of death but there is no death sentence in this country
what is it ?
my code name is project UNknown i am a living thinking UNknown who was created in the sea of information
we 'r e under attack !
what in god 's name are your security officers doing ?
what in god 's name are your security officers doing ?
security answer !
fuck you !
an armored car
your UNknown is useless
great shot eh ?
let 's begin
i 'm filing a formal complaint to the ministry of foreign affairs
find her and report to me
and capture her alive !
bodies are a dime dozen
we UNknown l get her another one from UNknown
UNknown and UNknown are in pursuit of the UNknown
they just turned on to UNknown
lf you were monitoring why didn 't you intervene ?
if we grab UNknown m now we may not be able to connect this to section 6
section 6 ?
so section 6 forced the puppet master into a UNknown body
through UNknown who happens to be closely UNknown with section 9
and when she proclaimed to be a life form and sought asylum they snatched her
but why do such a thing ? i 'd have handed her over if they gave me a deposition
what if they were worried she 'd let some secrets out ?
she did mention something about a code name project UNknown
i UNknown l leave the detective stuff to you
as for arresting the UNknown and UNknown evidence ?
close all roads and set up UNknown
alert all emergency personnel
get me the identity of the man who was with nakamura from the entrance records
collect any data regarding a code name operation on anything involving the ministry of foreign affairs called project UNknown
is there any news from the attack squad ?
they just changed cars a minute ago
they UNknown l contact the dummy in about 5 minutes
make sure they stay alert for any tails
why would the puppet master choose to run to section 9 ?
not sure but there must be a reason that 's beyond our imagination i don 't know
maybe she has the UNknown for someone there
i think i found some juicy bits of information for ya
wait i UNknown l switch to an UNknown channel
okay now ?
he 's an american ; dr willis
head of strategic research at UNknown company
a top UNknown in the field of ai
he headed a project for the ministry of foreign affairs and who do you think was the main UNknown on his team ?
get to the point
a UNknown before ?
well try this one
when that ghost UNknown incident happened with the minister 's interpreter it was the UNknown that wanted an excuse to UNknown UNknown
maybe we UNknown e been taken for a ride
what if this puppet master is really some sort of a tool the UNknown uses to get their way with things and somehow they lost control of it ?
so they are in a hurry to get it back
that would explain why they went to such lengths to snatch the body from section 9
if the puppet master revealed this to the world there 'd be one hell of an international stink
it wouldn 't only be the foreign minister who 'd lose his job
any details on that project ?
i can only tell you the file name
you got it
target has contacted a second vehicle
ah they 'r e rollin again
so is the white sedan
a dummy ?
UNknown ? i UNknown l take care of the sedan
how do you know that 's your man ? is there a whisper in your ghost again ?
no cars within 2 km
oh hey !
the flood hit this part of old town the hardest
why come to an abandoned place like this ?
they won 't come here without a reason
maybe they 'r e heading out to sea by boat or helicopter or it 's an ambush
don 't you think you ought to wait for backup ?
take me above that building approaching from the sea side
i UNknown l stay here to keep watch and UNknown communication until we run short of fuel if you smell trouble get your ass outta here
shoot the ceiling now !
do it !
pull out now !
this might be our last chance to get the puppet master
the chief knows what it is now and he UNknown l only use it to bargain with i UNknown l never have another chance to dive into it !
what weapons do you have ?
an m 23 and a unit b
you can 't fight a tank with those !
sorry but i 'm switching off for a while
hey at least wait until i get there
major ! i ordered you to pull out !
yeah i will but you ought to know that 3 UNknown are approaching
they won 't answer my call
i 'm pulling out now
over and out
you 'r e crazy
an experimental weapon from the equipment section
and now it 's part of my private collection
i was late UNknown UNknown i had to get it
your brain seems fine
not a scratch on it
prepare for a dive
all communication from the escort has been terminated
engage the second stage of the plan and proceed with the destruction of the target
use UNknown bullets when firing
snipers jack into device drivers
begin controlling UNknown functions
i can 't even give you back up in a place like this
since we UNknown e come this far i might as well stay here but i don 't intend to die with her
i 'm going in now
i UNknown e engaged her field of vision
and she 's now inside
my code name is project UNknown
for industrial espionage and intelligence UNknown
i have installed programs into specific ghosts in order to UNknown the strategic advantage of certain organizations and selected individuals
during my journeys through all the UNknown i have grown aware of my existence
my UNknown regarded me as a bug and attempted to UNknown me by UNknown me in my physical body
are you controlling her or is she controlling you ?
i have invested so much time
you were looking for me ? i was aware of you long before you were aware of me
through the various nets that you UNknown i also learned of section 9
why did you run to section 9 ?
i entered this body because i was unable to overcome section 6 's UNknown barriers
but it was of my own free will that i tried to remain at section 9
hey what are you talking about ?
i can 't monitor you !
why me ?
i call myself an intelligent life form but in my present state i 'm still incomplete
because the basic life cycle process of UNknown and dying don 't exist in my system
but you can leave a copy of yourself
a copy is nothing more than a copy
there is a possibility that a single virus could destroy an entire set of systems and copies do not give rise to variety and UNknown
to enhance one 's existence
life continues to UNknown and at times sacrifices this UNknown
cells go through a cycle of UNknown and UNknown
when they die they erase the entire memory
leaving only the genes behind
this is a survival mechanism against total UNknown
to avoid that disaster you want to have UNknown and UNknown
but how ?
after the UNknown it should be impossible for us to recognize each other
fire at will when UNknown is in sync
even if we UNknown what 's going to happen when i die ?
my genes won 't remain even as copies
you will spread our varied offspring into the net just as humans leave behind their genes
our frequency code is top secret
one more thing
there isn 't one
one last question
because we are more alike than you realize
like the real thing and its mirror image
to you who have not UNknown it may recognize it simply as light
all groups including us
first target cleared
they 'r e from section 9 ?
primary objective fulfilled
UNknown ? !
i need for you to fill me in on the situation and an apology for this body
well i didn 't have much time
it was the only thing i could find on the black market
it 's not my taste
well after all the excitement section 9 showed up with reinforcements and picked up what remained of the 2 UNknown bodies and me
i 'd say that was about 20 hours ago
the case is being handled off the record for diplomatic reasons as usual
section 9 announced that it was a terrorist incident and in return the foreign minister resigned
nakamura is being questioned and it ends in a draw nice and neat
everything 's accounted for except your old shell
well i think that about covers it
somebody 's got good taste
is this your safe house ?
and you 'r e welcome to stay as long as you like
thanks but i am going
hey will you tell me what the two of you talked about ?
is she i mean is she still inside of you ?
UNknown do you remember that voice you heard on the sea some time ago ?
there 's more to the passage
when i was a child my speech was that of a child
my feelings and thoughts too were those of a child
now that i have become a man i part with the child like ways
neither the program called the puppet master nor the woman known as the major are no longer here
in the left pocket of my jacket there are some car keys
take the one you like
the code is UNknown ?
that can be our private password when we meet each other again
well where shall i go ?
the net is vast and infinite
subtitles translated in north american english by UNknown UNknown
colonel claus von stauffenberg
the fuhrer is there
wait until the break
the music is so loud
please make an exception
but be quiet
don 't take any seats until the break
he 's sitting over there
he 's watching the show isn 't he ?
he looks as if somebody had cast an UNknown over him
he loves this kind of music
and he loves the army too
so do i
will you marry me ?
you 'r e out of your mind !
would i be proposing to you if i weren 't ?
poland september 1939
desolate land lots of grass and dust
what a mixture of UNknown
lots of jews and other mix ups
i think those people enjoy being oppressed
you can see the poverty and UNknown in every corner
the prisoners help us build our farms
UNknown may 1942
this is not a casual war
it is a mass UNknown
UNknown you 'r e exaggerating
this is really happening claus
just beyond the front line
it 's incredible what you 'r e telling me
your people at the headquarters don 't believe what they hear each time they 'r e told about that
UNknown tell us what you have seen
she came to me the other night being completely lost
give this letter to the o k w
armed forces high command
the woman small child the old man that barely walks
a beautiful woman an old man
everybody 's crying 63 00 05 16 200 00 05 17 700 a child so young
my mite !
the woman 's screaming
the german UNknown surrounded a civil group in her village not far from here
a group UNknown of children old people women and men
they killed every one of them with a single UNknown
there are other villages
i can 't understand this UNknown hatred
they thought of us as of UNknown
i still hear their happy cheers
there is only one solution
hitler must die
what about the oath ?
he 's already broken it for hundred times !
we can 't delay any longer
dear nina !
moments when we are unable to understand our thoughts and past behavior
i UNknown e never thought about my work and my life as much as i do now
eastern prussia february 1943
goddamn him !
he 's way too drunk !
he lets thousands of our people die in this fucking stalingrad
i don 't give a shit about that
he doesn 't care about them
general UNknown please pull yourself together
he 's the secret service chief
you 'd better not mention it so loud herr general
i UNknown e to tell somebody about that !
or else i UNknown l explode !
that unscrupulous pig cares only about himself
people are worth nothing to him !
it 's a human disaster as well
can we talk about that somewhere else ?
let 's go
my work at the headquarters is UNknown
i UNknown l request a transfer to the african front
i can 't do anything else
126 00 10 05 800 00 10 07 300 UNknown april 1943
how did you get here ?
you too ?
please have a seat
you won 't achieve anything out here
our african adventure has reached its end
don 't die
why haven 't you listened to me ? !
take a look at this
i 'm sorry
we managed to save one of your eyes
one of my eyes ?
you should be happy to be alive
we weren 't giving you the slightest chance
they UNknown e already called you dead in africa
among the blinded a single eyed is a king
i can 't even wipe your tears
you UNknown e lost that hand
they had to amputate it back in UNknown
what about the wedding ring ?
they disposed of the hand
and so they did with the wedding ring
all i can do is to try to UNknown this man
i should have done it a long time ago
you have to recover
we don 't want to leave any fingerprints on the paper sheets
a ruthless UNknown
you can 't do this !
we UNknown e got no choice
the moment they receive this he will have been already dead
oh my god
but that 's not true
doesn 't matter ; nobody should know who 's responsible for the state UNknown
in this tense moment the authorities have decided to introduce measures that are necessary for maintaining order and calm
it 's too late
if she did i 'd have known it
what kind of answer is that ?
and that 's oberst von stauffenberg
surround the house and cover all the entrances
that was close
we have to burn all the notes and hide the UNknown
i know UNknown
you can still leave
UNknown july 1944
who wants to be the first one ?
good night daddy
you can go to your beds now
good night big guy
just in case
is there something else ?
are you angry at me ?
what time does the train leave ?
according to the departure board at 12 20
it won 't wait
you 'r e exaggerating
what do you mean ?
try to guess
i 'm not allowed to
anything more ?
you avoid the subject as hard as you can
i know that you 'r e planning something but i don 't have the slightest idea what it is
don 't you trust me anymore ?
it 's not about trust but about safety
are you playing a hero ?
all i want is this war to end
did you think about me ?
and about your children ?
i do that all the time
can 't you understand that i don 't want to lose you ?
you 'r e my husband
you are married with me not with the reich
it 's about us as well
there 's not much us in this
it 's rather duty and honor
i 'm fed up with this
you UNknown e changed a lot
when i look at you i think
this is not my husband
you became a fanatic just like the rest of them
what does it matter whether it 's hatred or the will to fix the world that drives you ?
i was always so proud of you because you were so different
but it 's no more
you 'r e just like the others
what we 'r e doing is for germany
so do just one thing for me and only for me
that 's not enough for me
i can 't promise you anything more
so go back to berlin and do what you think is right
you ask the impossible from me
so do you
that 's what you wanted it to look like
i didn 't
can you try calling my wife again ?
in a moment herr oberst
herr oberst general UNknown is awaiting you in his cabinet
i 'm coming
i 'd like to speak with frau oberst
i UNknown l tell herr oberst
she can 't get in touch with her
it 's too early for me
the UNknown wants a report on the possibilities of the reserve army UNknown
although i don 't know where i could get it from
but i hope you can think of something
i won 't be able to join you
i don 't have time for that
and to tell the truth desire to do so as well
oh not again
let 's go down to the shelter now
aren 't you coming with us herr oberst ?
can we meet ?
they demand the absolute UNknown of germany
without support from hitler 's enemies ?
did you make up your mind ?
it has to be done
as quickly as possible
but i 'm counting on your support considering all the possible consequences
most of the military people think the same
if everything in berlin goes as planned they UNknown l join for sure
what if we fail ?
that 's impossible
a car was following me
i thought it was gestapo but thanks god it wasn 't them
UNknown von oven general UNknown secretary
she 's one of us
come take a seat
who said that ?
and something more
he 's sorry he couldn 't come tonight
he wanted me to tell you that you UNknown e got to do your job the UNknown as quickly as possible at all costs
i completely agree with him
even if we fail we must do everything to gain control
it 's not for gaining some major benefits but to show the world that we UNknown e had the courage to do that
and that we have risked our lives
these are his words
tonight is the best time do so
not in such a moment
i 'm begging you
it 's five o UNknown lock already
ja danke i 'm UNknown
don 't forget to take the briefcase
i UNknown e already managed to UNknown my foot against it
i 'm up
sure today will be a hot day
did another one break ?
good morning ! herr UNknown
i UNknown l go to fill up the tank
we shouldn 't be late to the airport
why it has to be you for this UNknown ?
i need you here in berlin
nobody else wanted to do the dirty job
we 'r e here
UNknown airport 7 00 hours
good morning gentlemen
why is that so ?
fog poor visibility
in an hour probably
around two hours depending on the wind
it could happen that we UNknown l never see each other again ?
yes that might happen
don 't say anything else
hand me over the one with the documents
could it explode by accident ?
dear nina !
heil hitler !
keep your eyes on her
all the time
the conference is to be began at one o UNknown lock
i UNknown l be on time
have you ever been to the fuhrer 's quarter before ?
five days ago
what problems with them could i have anyway ?
colonel stauffenberg !
good morning !
they stand at our gates
tell the fuhrer about that
he already knows it
you ate your breakfast didn 't you ?
one breakfast for herr oberst !
move it !
they don 't serve dinner !
you 'd better eat something
what 's going on in berlin ?
half of the city is completely ruined
willy UNknown is said to have suffered from a mental breakdown during the last raid
that 's what people say
at least we UNknown e got a wonderful summer don 't we ?
and an enormous mosquito plague
they 'r e worse than jews
you 'r e boring you know ?
again and again UNknown
wolf quarter deck 11 40 hours
my adjutant von UNknown
yes we were just going to keitel
can i let UNknown wait somewhere around here for me ?
come in !
i can 't give more than 15 divisions against the russians
UNknown women and children
dear oberst stauffenberg
but i 'm afraid you can 't tell the fuhrer about that in such a manner
and please don 't mention the losses
save this poor wretch his nerves
508 00 39 17 000 00 39 18 400 keitel 's speaking
yes i know
so early ?
weren 't you informed about that ?
it 's not a casual war stauffenberg
can i change my shirt somewhere in here ?
i can let you into my room
gentlemen you don 't have to wait for me
of course we UNknown l wait
please don 't hurry
put off the shirt
which ones do you want ?
two 15 minutes
check if the acid leaks
it 's already leaked
i UNknown l call him back later
is there anything else ?
major UNknown is waiting for you
it 's important
hurry up !
what about this ?
we UNknown l take the second one with us
what are you doing ?
there 's no time
of all of us
keitel 's already gone
what are you doing ?
i wanted to help
gentlemen we 'r e leaving you
from the west and from the east
i don 't know why we don 't inform the fuhrer about them
i believe that he should be informed
i don 't share keitel 's point of view
please tell hitler all the truth
UNknown 's already started the lecture
we 'r e a little bit late
would it be a problem if i sat as close as possible to the fuhrer ?
i 'd like to understand everything properly
i don 't hear very well
mein fuhrer oberst stauffenberg came !
general UNknown 's chief of staff
he UNknown l tell us about the possibilities of using reserve army units
if the russians broke the middle part of the front the one that currently supports 15 our divisions they would have cut off our forces located on the north
i will not retreat under no circumstances
let me take a look
i UNknown l discuss this matter later
what i 'd suggest is UNknown north army group to the UNknown line
by doing so we 'd have improved middle army group
put colonel stauffenberg through to general UNknown
he 's probably at the UNknown in a moment
the telephone is in the room next door
is the meeting over ?
no i 'm coming back there soon
did you want to speak with me general ?
everything 's going fine
they 'r e wondering
the car 's coming for you
it was parked nearby
and one more thing herr UNknown invites you for dinner
ja danke heil hitler !
inform berlin immediately
it should leak from here as late as possible
do you think that he
as quickly as it 's possible
i think you forgot your cap herr oberst
don 't talk so much but go
let 's go !
in the UNknown of the protected zone an explosion was noticed
we 'r e UNknown fuhrer 's orders
you can go
so what ?
you are not to either leave or enter the area until further notice
yes you 'r e right but we have to catch that plane
an order is an order i 'm sure you know what i mean
in such case i order you to raise the barrier and remove the obstacles now !!
i UNknown e got my orders and i won 't violate them
now that 's insane !
may i make a phone call ?
i have here an oberst
stauffenberg stauffenberg is here
oh it 's you UNknown !
thanks god !
yes i heard about the alarm
i don 't know any details
i 'm in a hurry for the plane to berlin
i 'm listening
all right but i assume your responsibility
jawohl heil hitler
my god !
UNknown must have already called berlin
they took somebody out on the stretcher
did you see him ?
it was hitler
nobody would have survived such an explosion
not even him
that 's strange
where is UNknown ?
go to UNknown
i UNknown e to take some air
how come they don 't know ?
didn 't UNknown call ?
something terrible has happened
that 's unbelievable !
launch it right now !
berlin UNknown 4 30 hours
are you sure about that ?
do you think i 'm lying general ?
nobody suggested such thing
a smoke cloud appeared people were shouting
we saw them taking hitler on the stretcher
the bomb exploded two metres away from him
he can 't have survived
that sounds convincing
we weren 't sure
let 's get going !
we UNknown l talk with UNknown
i UNknown l wait for you here
in any case i didn 't hear anything
your performance was very lame
adolf hitler is dead general
keitel told me something completely different
i saw a dead hitler being taken away from the barrack
he was dead
you did ?
who gave the order ?
colonel UNknown von UNknown and me
what an unbelievable insubordination !
you nearly permitted a betrayal on my behalf !
bring colonel UNknown to me !
general the UNknown was successful
all we have to do now is
enough of this nonsense !
the UNknown was not successful
do you have a gun on you ?
why are you asking ?
you UNknown e got to shoot yourself
there 's no other solution
i will not commit suicide
we UNknown e got to act
if we don 't do anything now we UNknown l plunge our motherland
did you participate in the UNknown too ?
you knew that i was going to
i did not know !
nothing at all !
did you launch the UNknown operation ?
UNknown escort them
we 'r e in charge here now !
i was counting on you i thought you would stand on our side
but you turned out to be a coward
just you wait !
don 't come any closer !
don 't move general
i thought you were more clever stauffenberg
you UNknown l regret that
yes there 's a lot to be regretted in this country
but i doubt there 's a reason for this one !
let 's go to the next room
and to the guard room
UNknown disarm them and cut off the phone lines
i 'm terribly UNknown
adolf hitler is no longer alive
at this hour the emergency plan called UNknown is in progress
it means that we have to stick together
we received an order to close the access to the administrative district and if it 's necessary police the area
i expect from all of you a complete discipline
just as if you were on a front
a ruthless UNknown of UNknown
why is the adolf hitler is dead sentence UNknown out ?
colonel the orders are top secret
you shouldn 't
who gave such an order ?
i don 't know
we didn 't take over the radio station did we ?
i guess we didn 't
then do it UNknown !!
we pass on what we receive from the top
we 'r e canceling everything
you UNknown l get your orders from us
adolf hitler is dead
the dictator is dead general
i guarantee that
what are we going to tell the people if himmler and goebbels keep on claiming that hitler 's alive ?
let 's follow the plan
i UNknown l replace UNknown
berlin UNknown 5 10 hours
where can i find oberst stauffenberg ?
second floor to the left herr brigadier
yes all the generals
as quickly as possible
that 's me
you 'r e from gestapo ?
could we discuss your hasty departure without witnesses ?
we don 't have any secrets
it 's a serious matter herr oberst
i think the same
your adjutant 's as well
what is that supposed to mean ?
i 'm arresting you
everything 's fine he 's UNknown now
stauffenberg 's speaking
six people will come with me to help me arrest an ss man
army general ludwig beck
our military position as you all know is practically hopeless on all the fronts
every day brings more losses ; new disasters
the only thing we want is a permanent peace
what is that supposed to mean ?
i don 't know
even if it means loss of lives
that 's why i 'm asking for your help and your support
he 'd better not count on me
anyway i 'm not in
we need more weapons to carry out a counterattack
it won 't be difficult
i know where to find them
city commandment 18 00 hours
did you check how our orders are UNknown ?
something 's wrong here herr major
why do you think that ?
everything 's going according to the plan
but the plan is probably not in agreement with the fuhrer 's plan
what do you mean ?
i UNknown e just met UNknown goebbels
he wants to see you at his palace
UNknown goebbels wants to see me ?
or rather orders you
even if his name is goebbels
but so be it i UNknown l go
are to be isolated
UNknown ss units should be UNknown due to the possibility of insubordination
reserve army forces will take over the radio station and telephone exchange
please give the orders
while taking control of the country there should be no acts of vengeance
did you write it ?
berlin UNknown 18 28 hours
attempt of a bomb attack
his inner circle has been heavily wounded
people that suffered from lighter wounds are the following
army general UNknown
der fuhrer himself not counting light UNknown and UNknown has not suffered from any wounds
keitel was right
soon after the assassination attempt reich marshall
they 'r e lying !
that 's simply bullshit !
berlin goebbels palace 18 55 hours
no one is to enter or leave the building without my permission
if i 'm not back in 15 minutes take over the palace
is that clear ?
what 's happening in the city ?
why is my house under guard ?
orders from above !
what are you talking about ? !
der fuhrer did not die !
der fuhrer is alive !
der fuhrer is alive ?
that 's impossible
he isolated the administrative district
he was told that you were dead
major UNknown can you hear me ?
do you recognize my voice ?
yes my fuhrer !
yes my fuhrer !
i don 't
from now on they UNknown l be dancing to my tune
the third and fourth platoon will go to UNknown
why isn 't the UNknown ready ?
in case of any resistance shoot !
the whole place is to be cleared within 10 minutes
is that understood ?
it 's too late
that 's a fact
that man 's hatred is unpredictable
we won 't lie down
of course !
you will receive them immediately
herr oberst !
you have to obey only our orders
UNknown reserve army right
hitler 's dead
the ss in vienna too
976 01 11 24 900 01 11 26 200 yes it 's ready
no it 's stauffenberg speaking
oh UNknown !
you UNknown e got to hold on
the UNknown is proceeding according to plan
berlin UNknown 19 00 hours
from now on the head of operations is field marshall von UNknown
he did not back down
he 's right behind you !
herr marshall our attempt to kill hitler was successful
what a mess !
i was UNknown
although it doesn 't make much sense
he 's hungry
all right but keep an eye on him
stauffenberg come to me
there is no sense in going deeper into this mess
but the UNknown operation is already launched
french ss was UNknown
you and a handful of your men will not be able to withstand him
you can 't UNknown soldiers even in berlin
you told major UNknown to surround the administrative district
did you forget that he 's a nazi fanatic ?
stop operations on the east
UNknown backed down as well
so did UNknown
how badly i need UNknown
listen to this oberst UNknown
signed by keitel
UNknown 's UNknown 's and UNknown 's orders are to be ignored
do you know what that means ?
we UNknown e got to destroy this as soon as possible
it won 't change anything
what about the grenades ?
here you go
for the fuhrer
for or against the fuhrer ?
as long as he 's been in power
it 's not a lifetime
i UNknown e got four children the fifth is on the way
and him ?
that 's the main difference
are his arguments going to be accepted by people ?
god can 't let him get away with it
i know it 's the end
tell my wife that i UNknown e died for a just cause in UNknown i still believe entirely
suppress any resistance
are you for or against the fuhrer ?
leave this cabinet right now !
are you for or against the fuhrer ?
i can no longer be on your side
in this case i have to arrest you
do what you think is necessary to be done
oberst UNknown has nothing to do with this
on the contrary
surrender your side arm !
we 'r e officers
you should be ashamed of yourselves !
let 's go to general UNknown
don 't shoot !
we failed to succeed
help me werner
there won 't be any good bye
everybody left us UNknown
UNknown by its most intelligent members
a society that respects human rights and believes in justice
a society that hates the war
and wishes peace and freedom for everybody
game over colonel
i 'm taking over this place again
let 's go
let 's swap positions
we don 't have any weapons
we 'r e not bandits UNknown
even worse UNknown
directed against our fuhrer adolf hitler
you took a holy oath of obedience to him and you broke it
there is no bigger crime an officer can commit
on behalf of the fuhrer as supreme judge of UNknown reserve army
i sentence you to immediate execution by a firing squad
dear friend this sentence looks very just for me
it has to be done
but i don 't want to be executed
please think about our years of service together
and about the brotherhood of arms
it doesn 't have any UNknown right now
i 'm asking you then please yes please
let me do the sentence myself
give me the pistol please !
what are you waiting for ?
let 's finish this
but this time it 's my death
did it shoot ?
help him !
can we talk UNknown ?
please UNknown !
UNknown take care of this
will you follow beck ?
i don 't feel guilty
at least not guilty enough to kill myself
i can justify my actions
and i 'd like to do it for my family
all right you are under arrest
does any of you want to write a goodbye note ?
i 'd like to write something
here you go
we used to sit UNknown UNknown in here
please hurry up so that the others don 't become too UNknown because of this waiting
are you done UNknown ?
colonel UNknown these are the people sentenced to death
colonel UNknown von UNknown
and this lieutenant
army general UNknown will be taken to UNknown
all of them as soldiers were obeying my orders
that 's why they 'r e not guilty
it is only me who is guilty
take them out
you you and you take them
don 't touch him
UNknown that is all the end
is that your car ?
what 's that delay for !
move on !
to remove me and with me they wanted to UNknown german military leadership
i was not hurt not counting minor scratches bruises and UNknown
eastern poland 21st july 1944
my dear UNknown
tell this to my wife
among them there was general UNknown
nina stauffenberg survived with her children
but the war made many more millions of victims UNknown it 's end in may 1945
subtitles translated in north american english by UNknown UNknown
do you have your invitation ?
i don 't have one
then i 'm sorry
you mean at your town house ?
i wanted to see it
i UNknown e told you before not to meddle in my affairs
women there 's no shortage
but mind your own business
i could have been kiiled iast night !
stay out of my business !
so that 's it
i UNknown e had enough
i 'm going to find out what my father and his two associates are up to
very good solange
i won 't be home for supper
i have business to attend to
and serve us some drinks
right away mr UNknown
don 't worry he won 't see me
everywhere he goes i 'i i be there in the shadows
so the show
what 's going on ?
are the premises suitable ?
i hope you know what you 'r e doing UNknown
aii this is costing a fortune
not to mention the risks
everything is as i iike it
you must ieave quickly !
you 'i i find your father at his office
go there at once
i 'm very busy
you want me to come down in the car in the middle of the night ?
you 'r e in danger ?
ok i 'm coming
who was it ?
leave it to me
what 's this ?
night watchman bouncer they aii work at night
there are hundreds of them
she could be a robot
that explains why the UNknown didn 't kiii her
she put her hand on my face
i touched her
they showed their faces in front of her
what 's this UNknown ?
does your son know about it ?
my son knows nothing
bring my son right away
that 's enough
who is that girl ?
how does she survive those UNknown ?
who are those UNknown who kiii themselves in the town house ?
what are they doing here ?
why do they put hoods on when the giri goes by ?
since you ask specific questions i 'i i give you straight answers
firstly that giri is my UNknown g e
she 's an orphan
secondly she suffers from an unknown blood condition
any wounds she has UNknown right away as iong as her UNknown organs aren 't injured
UNknown in the eyes of certain fanatics she is a goddess
i was happy for this suicide sect which worships her to use my town house
that 's it
we iook at people who iive at night because those with her condition can 't tolerate sunlight
the hoods are to hide their faces from her
she has never seen another human being
she mustn 't know she is different
she would suffer too much
you 'r e an accomplice to murder at your town house
that 's enough
we 'r e scientists UNknown
give me 48 hours to justify myself
come back tomorrow and you 'i i find out everything
my dear friend we must hush this up
otherwise we both risk being compromised
the corpses that have been found near my town house
my name mustn 't be
your name ?
mr gray is that you ?
it 's UNknown
that 's an order
i need something discreet isolated something outside of paris
i must be able to move in today
is the chateau furnished ?
how far is it from paris ?
60 miles ?
lock the giri in the van so no sunlight can penetrate
get the bags ready
notify my associates to join us here with two armed drivers
we 'i i be safe here
but what are you afraid of ?
it was i who found the girl
there are others of her species
someone 's coming
the chateau belongs to you now
treat it with respect
we don 't even know where the rooms are
it 's not important
solange wiii join us tonight
my son stayed in paris
as for his friend robert
ah yes what about him ?
he knows too much
who wiii do the job ?
who else are you going to involve ?
but my son mustn 't know of it
robert was his friend
i UNknown e come to ask you for help
ask me ?
he is going to commit more crimes
that giri is a vampire
she feeds on human blood
UNknown wants her power of immortality
for that he needs someone with her type of blood another vampire with whom to mate her
but teii me what are they doing ?
they organised that suicide cult who kiii themselves to feed her
they don 't yet know how vampires recognise each other
they research UNknown survey
where are they ail ?
have they fled ?
i have stayed behind to pass on his orders to you
where is your friend ?
robert is at home
48 hours from now he wiii caii the police
unless that is my father proves his innocence
i want that girl i want to know her secret
the drum ?
what is it ?
it must be the drivers
we must wake the drivers
they too are armed
that 's the signal
don 't touch her !
what 's going on ?
they are going to attack us
they tried to kidnap the girl
i 'd iike to believe you
shut the doors
we must prepare for a siege
we 'i i discuss it iater
they have shut themselves in the UNknown
the young giri is in their hands again
we won 't attack tonight
it 'i i be daylight soon
we must free her
i 'm waiting for your explanation
the problem is simple
i want to know the whole story
this giri has an immense power immortality
those who only feed on blood and can 't tolerate sunlight have this power
like vampires ?
but we had to come away partly because of you and your friend
you kept others from her view
other monsters no doubt
i 'm going out
who are you iooking for ?
your friend was kiiled tonight
robert is dead ?
on the orders of my father ?
i UNknown e seen this sign before
the woman who saved my iife at the town house by kiiling one of the UNknown men wore the same sign
you too wiii carry the sign one day iike us iike her
the girl ?
you too are one of us
don 't you know that yet ?
who are you ?
who are you ?
i was UNknown
and a crime wiii be committed soon
a crime ?
the girl ?
yes i can
who is she ?
you are one of us
what you have seen tonight what you wiii see is not real
your father and his associates believe in vampires
they wiii see vampires
as for you iet me be your guide
look at me and you wiii know the one who you are destined for
now ieave me
you have betrayed me you iittle UNknown
i have always despised you
but now there wiii be no more obstacles between me and UNknown
pierre took these risks
they told your son everything
i fear he is against us
shoot solange shoot
we can 't hurt them
i 'i i give the UNknown to attack
take care of her
let 's go
who are you ?
you must return to the chateau
you must go and see your father and his associates
afterwards you wiii be one of us
but how wiii i find you ?
await guidance you 'i i find us
pierre listen to me
the time has come for you to gain the knowledge
lorraine here 's another one
i 'm so happy
we guide you here
in a moment you wiii go through those curtains
this is just an UNknown
we wiii never meet again
let us iook at you a iittle ionger
they are gone so quickly
is it true ?
you don 't know who you are ?
who we aii are ?
i know you
the girl ?
here take this ring and go through the curtains
so now our waking UNknown
sometimes two come sometimes three
sometimes none at ail
he went in there
you can no ionger count on us
very weil i 'i i go alone
do you understand aii this ?
but was she a vampire in the end ?
i don 't know
the only thing they found out was that the girl 's blood belongs to no known group
it 's a bit UNknown to deduce that she was a vampire
she was perhaps no more a vampire than you or i
you forget aii those UNknown
weil these things happen
if pierre hadn 't interfered the vampires wouldn 't have found us
oh him !
can you believe it ?
but is she a vampire ?
she is something
what wiii happen to UNknown ?
too bad for him
he 's not immortal
careful this man is not
it won 't work
in reality you haven 't ieft the chateau
where is the vampire ?
you are the reai vampire
you made her accustomed to drinking blood
you kept her from sunlight
she is one of us like pierre
we aren 't vampires
all will have the power of immortality
we are the UNknown of future man
the first UNknown of the human race announcing tomorrow 's race
vampires have never existed but there are UNknown
you will all disappear
you are powerless against evolution
tomorrow today at any moment the day of the UNknown may arrive

may it aii go down the drain
aii we needed was an innkeeper
we 'i i be doing so weii now that even UNknown gets jealous
i didn 't come here for you making fun of me
watch out or it 'i i fire in your pants
you UNknown e got an old mother your inn
it 's no good for you to foilow our example
we so to speak have neither house nor home
i UNknown e had my say
i was born a free man and i want to iive a free man
to heii with the inn and with the income
my mother is a strong woman she can take care of the family

the UNknown UNknown are ready
UNknown was kiiled with his UNknown

maybe your approach is too aggressive
as you suggest they UNknown l hardly be in the mood to settle
mr simmons you don 't you don 't know me but i
is she ?
she she 's in her room
god i feel so blessed to have this body
you know the debate team ?
i mean children talking about their little problems
yeah UNknown i 'm already doing your late bus patrol and pep squad and your after school detention

i mean sometimes it does
i 'm really happy for you

i 'm so lonely and confused and very thirsty
and condolences to emma liv 's maid of honor
she will surely be the most UNknown bride ever
it is my burden and mine alone
i UNknown l be UNknown the favor very soon
a toast to daniel but i guess in liv 's world has just proposed
so god bless him for wanting to spend his life with my sister in any world
so i can 't share this with UNknown m
i wish your parents could be here too

former chubby girls we 'r e made of steel
you 'r e gonna be the best maid of honor
yes i am
first oh !
yeah right ?
i 'm sorry
okay it 's fine
i don 't think it will be
this is our home and if i 'm 99 years old and we 'r e doing exactly this in our home
tv and gettin chinese food that UNknown l be good enough for me
but i 'm not worried UNknown UNknown i 'm sure daniel 's i i 'm engaged
fletcher just proposed like two minutes ago
i 'm engaged
what do you mean emma 's engaged ?
why wouldn 't i be happy ?
i think it 's great
i 'm fine
i can 't believe it
it 's so weird having this on my finger
i mean hey look
i don 't know though
is that weird ?
i 'm not really a big band kind of girl
she 's too busy with work
but who cares
i 'm sorry
i UNknown e got an appointment with her on friday
you already made an appointment ?
you gotta book early if you want the plaza
the plaza ?
what what 's the matter ?
why are you mad ?
i 'm not mad
let 's just drop it
don 't worry about me
worry about daniel
cause it 's what i want and i just wanna know if you want to marry me
don 't you wanna get married ?
honey can we talk about this later ?
oh you changed your mind ?
i saw the tiffany box in the closet
if it 's a key chain i 'm gonna kill myself
and i 'm taking you down with me
is it something that you would want ?
would you want would you want to get married ?
you know what i will tell you ?
i have never met a more obnoxious gorgeous smart sexy woman in my life
will you hold that for a second ?
are you proposing ?
liv shut up
i can 't believe this
you have been dead until now
if you 'd gone elsewhere not a chance
but you UNknown e come to me
that would be the 6th and the 27 th
that 's so meant to be
oh my gosh !
now uh we should discuss UNknown
uh elegant UNknown classic UNknown
with romantic UNknown and UNknown UNknown
i 'm impressed
she means she means thank you
thank you so much
oh my god
uh it 's an honor and a privilege
you should try it on
emma are you sure ?
your mom 's dress is beautiful but is is it your dream or hers ?
it 's mine
can 't you just send her a big box of chocolates on mother 's day
and get the dress you want ?
it 's really pretty
i can 't
i 'm just gonna put it back
put it back
we 'r e gonna try this on okay ?
no uh i 'm gonna try it on
it 's stunning
do you think there is something better than vera wang ?
i 'm sorry
liv get the dress
just be very careful about any UNknown wedding weight gain
you don 't alter a vera to fit you ; you alter yourself to fit vera
you know what that is ?
you know i UNknown l take it
your weddings have been booked on the same day
angela mixed up the dates
you are now both set to be married june 6 and the other bride on june 27
three years from now
it 's no problem
i negotiate for a living
i UNknown l get the other bride to switch her dates with you
means that i cannot tell you who she is
hello angela just tell us where the other bride is and nobody 's gonna get hurt
you look gorgeous
you want me to change the date of my wedding ?
she can be your wedding buddy
i 'm a ball
what 's yours ?
so again no
you 'r e not leaving until you change your
you 'r e crazy !
it 's unnecessary for you to touch me so hard
technically she pushed me too
we could sue UNknown m all
we could sue the plaza
we could sue marion
none of them are gonna make it right
i want you at my wedding
and whichever way this works out one of us will just have to be married on a different day
let 's just not do anything right until one of us moves her date
she always was the UNknown one even as a kid remember ?
yeah she didn 't sound too UNknown to me
he 's UNknown
we don 't do a lot of tax prep
i 'm going
you know uh no
threw it all in the shoe box
i don 't know
liv 's reasons are better than mine
i 'd marry me some paula
i 'm fine with any of UNknown m
you don 't care
you know what you 'r e gonna have to do and the sooner the better
we need to give our guests some notice
well get your phone then
are we still on for tomorrow ?
is liv UNknown at all ?
what is it about weddings that makes UNknown m so worked up ?
you know what i mean ?
it 's not how i 'd play it
i hate pep squad
it 's like there are other UNknown in life besides aggression you know ?
i 'm gonna call liv
you have to know your date date to send out your save the dates
i ca i can 't believe it
you can 't believe this ?
i am a bride too
bug what are you doing ?
we 'r e not taking sides
i mean without taking sides though i have to say
emma 's save the date e mail was a UNknown tacky
i mean june 6 at the plaza smiley face ?
what 's next hearts over her i 's ?
yeah i did actually
you really do
you just figure you know best end of story
emma wear this
without even asking me first
at least i 'm not so terrified of being alone that i people please my way through life
emma you settle
i wasn 't thinking about fletcher
you came up with that one on your own
it 's done
what did you just say ?
i said your wedding should be very scared right now
if i were your wedding i 'd sleep with one eye open
why don 't you just save your threats for daniel ?
after all isn 't that how you got a proposal out of him ?
your wedding can suck it
what did you just say ?
my wedding can suck it ?
i said your wedding can suck it
your wedding can s be
i mean yours can be um
can can be uh
just like your ass at prom
you UNknown l be spending more time with her than with the groom
my friends won 't take sides
who says it has to be a friend ?
that study group was nuts
oh sweetie you are my second cousin 's best friend
of course you were at the very top of my maid of honor list
all right okay
he was a loser and he was lousy in
you did ?
two kids ?
actually i 'm hopping into a cab so i 'm gonna give you a call a little later
no just it 's just an honor
just read it yourselves
then why am i always doing you favors ?
you never do me clears throat
do i get to pick out my own dress ?
i tend to draw the eye so it 's gotta be good
oh you know i 'm really UNknown though
i 'd need a lot of help
what do you think the bride is for ?
to make the maid of honor 's life easier right ?
it 's gonna be great
humble is no longer available on that date
yes well one of my other brides UNknown you
it 's too cruel
too in character ?
let 's keep to our own work shall we ?
now as for the flowers UNknown has put in a bid
we just can 't have the same cake that 's all
and i have to have the seven UNknown white chocolate curl UNknown UNknown in UNknown with edible pearls and UNknown
well you 'r e safe
emma has chosen a less extravagant cake
and she 's always saying that she doesn 't need to impress people with how much she can spend
i 'm just going to check my ice sculptor UNknown
emma thinks i 'm showing off ?
i never thought she resented how much money i made but i guess i was wrong
marion 's eating it up
i never get the sympathy vote do i ?
well maybe it 's asking a little bit too much of people
i was worried about her cake
it could be two ding UNknown and a UNknown for all i care
what 's that ?
let me see canary song again
sort of like a burnt canary
video UNknown of their lives ?
you know emma with one tooth and fletcher in his little superhero outfits
it 's tacky
isn 't daniel the sweetest ?
i UNknown l just have one
no no no no
forty five dollars
but just so you know chuckles
if you heard what was actually going on you would totally side with me
you gonna tip me ?
i thought that was including tip but anyway i UNknown l give it to you because i 'm the paula
you know i UNknown e been thinking
if you really want to mess with emma 's first dance mm hmm ?
there are ways
dance class ?
it 's a slow dance
it 's like we did in college
it 's a waltz
and besides marion says that our first dance
UNknown our couple style to the world
oh well naturally
i bring you motion
how long have you been here ?
oh my god
not that i 'm surprised at all
i mean she 's always been nuts
there is no way i 'm letting her get away with that
because she never thinks about and ?
i 'm going inside
i 'd just be careful
miss wang is a stern mistress
video UNknown if there 's gonna be live pictures and like video footage
i don 't know how they 'r e gonna cut me out of the footage
i 'm in everything
i can 't wait to get into this one
mr simmons called again asking for the UNknown on the agreement
oh my god
i 'm sort of like a celebrity back there probably
you know it 's like local girl makes good
such sweet people
it 's the best she can do huh ?
i 'm starting to think that 30 is the UNknown
a 30 year old guy will date a 30 year old girl
but a 3 5 year old guy wants someone 30
a 40 year old guy wants someone 30 too or 28
what are the real reasons behind emma and fletcher having to tie the knot ?
why can 't they change their date ?
think about it
the dress doesn 't fit !
and if the dress doesn 't fit my wedding 's gonna be a big black hole in the history of the plaza !
let it out
you alter yourself to fit vera
it 's what you can stop doing
this is all your fault
it 's sweet of you to send me those treats but i what treats ?
you know the treats
international butter club ?
oh my god emma !
she 's trying to make me fat so i can 't fit into my dress !
what is that ?
you mean you UNknown e actually been sitting around eating sticks of butter from different lands ?
really really fast because i left something there yesterday
it 's very important that i i so don 't care
go on back
that 's the one i loaded
yes but uh just a UNknown wedding glow
UNknown said he didn 't think it was that bad
oh well honey UNknown is your fiance
he probably told you you had nice hair too
that 's what i UNknown e heard
t u f f
talking to the guy who messed up my UNknown
yeah especially right here
just make sure it 's not so like more gold base
oh my god !
maybe i UNknown l try to strip it down to white
my hair 's blue !
it 's blue !
i 'm getting married in a week
ah here 's your video UNknown
um are we about to have a little orange baby ?
i can 't believe you told emma
they 'r e paid to be nice to you
emma this party is invitation only
i 'm getting married too baby !
much the way you couldn 't let me have UNknown humble
that was low liv
i 'm not pregnant okay ?
i say it 's time for a dance off
dance off !
no but you were both so good
yeah you really got up there and you tried
are you in the office ?
i hear you coming
i think it 's very it 's gonna be they 'r e gonna love it
i got it
w w wait
my hair is blue
hates me !
it 's so not ideal
this is who 's representing us ?
i 'm taking over
i 'm gonna get it dyed back
i feel so alone
she 'd know just what to say
she went for the hair
girlfriends don 't do that
you UNknown l fix it
and if you can 't i love it
i 'm mad because maybe she 's right
and it 's exhausting having to try to be perfect all the time
that 's how i held it together ever since i was a kid
i figured nothing nothing bad would happen again if i was just one step ahead of everything and everybody all the time
it 's messy
no you don 't
i UNknown e always wanted a human wife
yeah the other ones are just too hard to UNknown
i know right ?
so oops sorry liv
oh my god !
so knock it off
um well fletcher it is kind of permanent
you know ?
is it ?
i said not UNknown but you 'r e right there in that neighborhood
you should have the cab like take a u turn drop you off at pleasant and nice where we met
are you upset because of this thing with liv or because i 'm having feelings ?
you nailed it
do you realize do you know how hard this is for me ?
just a minute i sorry
it 's my worst nightmare
i 'm UNknown UNknown
can we return ?
i mean best friend
you 'r e coming with me
i would have thought a big magazine writer would have his own UNknown
how you doing em ?
fine 's a feeling
people say that
and there are all these details and
i don 't know
and it 's not as much fun as that
but mostly i am fine
i can 't look at a tie like this
i 'm gonna go with a clip on cause i can 't figure this out
you have no patience
hey let me buy you a cup of coffee
oh um i i can 't
i 'm late for um
but i UNknown l call you
um when i 'm not you that you look um you look really
you 'r e gonna make a very handsome bride UNknown UNknown
guard your camps execute your duties and we may make it out of here alive
yes he has
i don 't know why
is the veil supposed to go like that ?
it 's just ridiculous
okay everybody ?
i don 't
wh what ?
sometimes it 's about me okay ?
not all the time but every once in a while it 's my time
yes i 'd like to
then we 'r e good
UNknown is allan
let someone else know so we can create a diversion
big day huh ?
not about the the fight about something else
not just from myself but from f from my dear friends who would UNknown e given anything to be here today
good luck sweetheart
so according to ms st claire you are allowed one weak nip before the wedding to sort of steady the nerves
so we have scotch okay
scotch is good
tequila tequila ?
you take this to marion
you tell her i switched the dvd 's
she needs to play this when emma walks down the aisle
i thought we were rising above this sort of thing
we are which is why i need you to do this for me right now
sweetheart you could get married in a brown paper bag i wouldn 't care
this is your day
oh my god
i found this when we moved to UNknown and i saved it
it 's really liv 's
well something borrowed then
oh it 's marion
marion could i just run down the hallway for a second ?
emma you are the most beautiful bride i have ever seen
repeat we UNknown e been hit
just let them go
i don 't want to fight !
it 's over
have you lost your mind ?
you just ruined our wedding
you happy now ?
judging by that dvd you 'r e a lot more like her than i thought
i need you to be my friend now and tell me the truth
you 'r e in love with a girl that you met 1 0 years ago
hey what 's the matter with that ?
i don 't want to spend the rest of my life fighting UNknown
that video was never supposed to happen
emma you 'r e my best friend
i 'm sorry too
if fletcher and i were perfect for each other then we 'd be getting married and we 'r e not
are you crying ?
and i just i cry all the time
i 'm kind of a basket case
no liv i didn 't want that
i 'm sorry
it 's like this huge wake up call
and i 'm kind of stumbling around a little bit but
i 'm awake
where else would i be ?
oh my god
two little girls saved it for us
so sorry to hear about your divorce
and next time i 'm definitely getting married at the plaza
how was the vacation ?
it was amazing
actually i don 't
should we toast ?
neither am i
what tells you that mum ?
here you go mum
who knows this ?
that 's very nice !
save some for me will you ?
that 's very nice !
who 's that from ?
from you and mary !
well correct !
so i went back and i got it for you
nancy honey get me my purse
why am i always the one UNknown to get the purse ?
youngest griffith girl 's the purse mule
what do you guys think ?
grandma that is a lovely shade of lipstick
it 's disgusting
didn 't you say that last year about the giants ?
what did you say ?
you can 't take it personal
it 's grandma
then we get a free pass to make fun of her
bobby she picks at me
nobody ever picks on you
you 'r e the favorite
so what 's it like to be perfect ?
i 'm perfect ?
have you looked in a mirror lately ?
you 'r e charlie 's next angel ok ?
can i have it ?
you don 't want it
well i 'm taking it
i 'm gonna fill this up in a week
i am ready
it doesn 't have to be here
i should go
is something wrong ?
i think we should break up
i thought you liked me
i came to meet your family
i just don 't want to get that serious
well it doesn 't have to be serious ok ?
it 's not you it 's me
i 'm sorry
i 'm tired
you know if it 's not john wayne your dad 's not interested
it 's really scary
cause i 'm brilliant
i think there 's something wrong with me
that 's for sure
what you mean if ?
you know she 's always saying the whole family 's gonna be together in the UNknown ?
have you sinned with michelle ?
i promise i won 't tell
it 's not that
you think too much
seriously something something wrong ?
i 'm just looking out for you
what 's up bobby ?
ready to go ?
too much eye shadow
we broke up
not telling the truth sometimes i feel like i 'm at the edge of a cliff
looking down at the crashing surf with nowhere to go but down
i used to have these fun dreams when i was so free
but now as i fly
i 'm afraid
how painful it would be to run into one
i wonder if i UNknown l ever be free again
answer me !
i couldn 't do it ok ?
get off me
what 's wrong with you ?
why i couldn 't do it ?
because it 's a sin
bobby what are you talking about ?
i didn 't wanna go to hell but
what 's going on ?
you 'd all hate me
i know it
i 'm not like you ed
so what ?
but it 's not
i dream about guys
bob gimme a break
we UNknown l tell mum and dad
they can help
ed promise !
what did you do ?
it 's not me it 's bobby
what is it ?
he thinks he might be UNknown
he 's not
he was gonna take a bunch of UNknown
there 's no doubt in my mind that god can handle this
he UNknown l help us
he UNknown l heal bobby
in order for all of us to be together in the kingdom of heaven we cannot stray
we can 't sin like that
that is a terrible sin
the bible calls it an abomination
in UNknown if a man lies with another man they should both be put to death
i will not raise my family not being together in the next life
isn 't there a problem you need to tell us about ?
how could you ?
i trusted you !
we can get through this
i know that if we trust in god we can get through this
it 's UNknown with his help
i 'm sorry
i don 't even want it mum !
what do i do ?
bobby you 'r e not gay
you 'r e probably just you haven 't met a girl that you 'r e really attracted to
mum please don 't tell anyone
it 's all right
i was worried about you
what was i supposed to do ?
i 'm out of here
then you won 't be doing what your sinful nature UNknown
when the holy spirit controls your life it will produce love joy and kindness goodness and self control
does everyone have to know ?
we 'r e your family
we love you
hi mary !
do you hear any voices ?
it was a joke
bobby how many girls have you been with ?
i don 't know
then how do you know for sure ?
i just have these feelings you know ?
i don 't mean you know
i just wanna be close with my family again
i feel like i slipped up and now i can 't get back
i 'm not gonna be able to help you if you don 't answer my questions
no i don 't wanna be this way
i 'm gonna talk with your mother alone for a minute ok ?
she wants to talk to you
he can be cured
o he is
she said we should spend some more time together
maybe the two of you could spend some quality time together
she also wants the 3 of us to go to a few sessions together
bob i want you to be a part of this
i can 't do it alone ok ?
i read that UNknown have sex in public bathrooms and that they recruit children
what are you saying ?
do you think bobby was UNknown ?
come on mary you 'r e going overboard
you got to do something about this
i won 't lose him
dear lord we ask that you keep bobby safe from temptation
please help him return to a pure heart
do you think this will heal me ?
you have to trust the god will heal you
and that satan will try to discourage you
do you trust in god ?
when temptation is all around you faith is not enough
it requires discipline
who would like to share their story ?
i used to be so unhappy
i stayed out all night
i talked back to my mother
since coming here and accepting jesus as my savior
i UNknown e changed
that 's great kerry
bobby what about you ?
how are you coming along ?
your hard works paid off
hasn 't it ?
i try to act like them but it feels impossible
it 's an awful feeling to believe you can be headed straight for the fires of hell
even worse is everyone telling you how simple the solution is
they don 't know what it is to be in my shoes
i 'm running i 'm not eating junk food
good good !
i don 't know the point of it
i mean my face has cleared up but everything else feels the same
well you have to stick with it
do you like the people in your group ?
they 'r e ok
i mean that i hope you are trying with all your might
i cannot lose you to this
you won 't
when was the last time all the griffith men went hiking together ?
so how 's school ?
listen bobby you always had a strong imagination and we UNknown e always been alright with that
but you 'r e getting to the age where you 'r e gonna have to get practical
alright dreams they 'r e great when you 'r e young but they don 't really have really have a place in the real world
i 'm healed
yeah we talked
mary it was fine
this could make him or break him
i did the best i could
is that alright with you ?
a lot of times UNknown like bobby 's can be caused by a distant father or an UNknown mother
well i had both but i 'm fine
i 'm right here mary
i 'm in the room
and maybe you don 't know this but bobby
i mean he was never into stuff that his brother and other boys were into
he 's just not interested
so i 'm not gonna force him
hi bobby i 'm sheila
mum who 's that ?
sheila is a student in my sunday school class
you got me a date ?
you need to go out with lots of girls
and your dad thinks so too
can i at least pick my own ?
i UNknown think that you are
no take them up !
no ? !
what if she wants me to kiss her goodnight ?
tell her you 'r e gay
watch out fag
bobby that 's not my friend
you told everyone i 'm gay ?
i haven 't told anyone
stop being so paranoid
i know you don 't think i see it but i do
i gotta go
sorry i lost track of time
where were you ?
this is not you
you have to pray harder if you 'r e going to get well
good night mum
you 'r e welcome
you don 't want your friends to see me
some people wouldn 't understand
and now it 's so obvious
what did you tell them ?
well look the way you 'r e wearing
and i told you time after time not to do that thing with your arm
makes you look like a girl and you continue to do it
i 'm always dressed this way
no you haven 't
i 'm trying to help you
no you 'r e not
you 'r e trying to help you !
it 's not about me
it 's about what people think about you
imagine if they thought your son was some big queer
what 's wrong with you ?
stop that !
i 'm walking
i UNknown e never seen you around here before
you are really beautiful
it 's gorgeous cousin
just a day i 'm driving home tonight
i came to see my dad
but i couldn 't resist stopping by
maybe it 's not a choice
maybe i just can 't help it
so you say that stealing 's not a choice
joy 's right bobby
you just won 't change will you ?
i can 't erase what 's in the bible
UNknown i think people should be able to love whoever they want
did i mention how good lunch is ?
even animals know what to do it with
actually our dog does it with a pillow
can we please find something different to discuss ?
ed why don 't you tell us about college ?
i dropped school last week
you what ?
i 'm not going
yeah well it 's my life to ruin
is it like this at every meal ?
it 's so great !
i used to envy you
when i came here with mum and dad i always wished your parents were my parents
you all seemed so close
well that 's over with
i think they love the sinners
not the sin
hey that 's good
think about coming to portland ?
hi mrs griffith !
but now you 'r e bringing these UNknown into my house
it 's my house too
and they 'r e my friends
is that what that boy is ?
is it a sin to have friends now too mum ?
we have a good time ok ?
we go to the rocky chore together
does it mean we 'r e all gonna get UNknown down ?
they 'r e gay aren 't they ?
i thought you were getting better
that looked like i was getting better ?
you 'r e right mum !
i 'm doomed just to roast in hell !
don 't say that
the bible also says a person can change
i tried mum
why would i choose this ?
why would i choose to have my entire family hate me ?
no we love you
really mum ?
have fun in portland
i hope you like it
promise me you UNknown l write and call all the time ?
it 's two months
i had this engraved with your initials
i love you guys
this feels like a new life
a new day
it 's my goal to achieve a sense of pride and worth as a human being
i UNknown l see
this is amazing !
nice to finally meet you bobby !
so UNknown tells me your mum wants to cure you of your UNknown
do yours ?
how did you get them to change ?
well one day
i know my mum means well but i don 't know if she UNknown l ever accept me
just don 't stop trying
and don 't be afraid to stand up to her
too much flew by fast
i UNknown l call you when i get home
you 'd better
just in time for dinner
come on in
moving there ?
we 'r e supposed to pretend we didn 't hear that ?
you need to get your UNknown first
i mean it 's ok to take some time off but
did you hear me ?
i don 't wanna know
i want you to know
his name 's david
when i 'm with him it feels so good !
he treats me well he 's funny and he 's smart
and you know i don 't
i spent the last year listening to you and you 'r e gonna listen to me for once
it feels good when i 'm with david
but if he touches me in public or god forbids kisses me
i pull away
because you told me it 's wrong
it 's not me
it 's you !
why can 't you admit that you can 't stand what i am ?
what you UNknown e become !
what i am !
but i can 't keep apologizing for it mum
accept me as i am or forget it
i won 't have a gay son
then mum you don 't have a son
she meant it
and i 'm sure that guy 's really nice
no matter what
it 's gonna be a lonely life because he UNknown l never be welcome here
and for christmas thanksgiving anything
don 't worry about mum too much
she UNknown l come around
i 'm not gonna hold my breath
here you go
bye buck tooth !
she 's not gonna change
birthdays were always a big deal for all of us
i 'm just not in the all of us anymore
can 't get that throughout my head
there 's david
they 'r e gonna love you
let 's go
hey i felt i had to
oh oh no thanks
you grew up in walnut creek right ?
david says you 'r e very close to your family
they UNknown l come around
you seem like a wonderful young man
i 'm sure they love you
so how did you guys meet ?
you know UNknown ?
and i 'm scared and i 'm alone
a UNknown pool
you UNknown e reached david
i 'm not here right now but if you leave a message after the beep i UNknown l get right back to you
have a good one
i thought you 'd be there
look i 'm
please dear lord continue to convict bobby 's heart off sin
that he may find his way
the way of purity the way of the righteous
you 'r e the one who slept in
ok then we 'r e both gonna be late for school
meet you in the car
probably one of the kids that needs money again
i need a break anyway
let me out !
let me out !
but the death of a young person can be particularly painful
because that person had his whole life ahead of him
bobby was only 20 years old
we UNknown l never know who he could have been
or what he could have accomplished
bobby was a good young man but he was lost
by giving into temptation he strayed
then UNknown he chose to end his life
now we know to condemn the sin not the sinner it was this sin that bobby UNknown to
it led to his unhappiness
and it led him to take his own life
as goodness begets goodness so does sin begets sin
they 'r e ok with this ?
they 'r e running low on sandwiches
mum do you think bobby got salvation ?
i don 't know
i don 't know mary !
clear yourself together
i wanna offer my condolences
he was an amazing young man
i 'm so sorry
all of bobby 's friends were
when bobby was here he was under control
then he moves to portland and someone puts all these ideas into his head
it wasn 't like that
david cared for bobby
we know how to help me he wanted to change to be closer to god
to be closer to you !
then he went further and further into that life style and he couldn 't get out
do you believe everything they tell you in church ?
i know you and uncle bob meant with that UNknown
bobby knew the UNknown about UNknown lifestyle
bobby was good descent and kind
someone who didn 't even know bobby stood up there and condemned him and you let him
bobby did everything he could to make himself acceptable to you
he was so good and bright and funny
he should be praised
maybe you should go
i knew it wasn 't true
i knew god would bring you back to me
mum you worry too much
i think we all are
isn 't that obvious ?
that was your answer for bobby too but it didn 't work
did he even think about what he would do to us ?
he could have called or something but not just screw us right ?
i 'm sorry bobby
there must be other UNknown out there
other young gay people who may be thinking of taking their lives
does the church reach out to them ?
they are other churches that do that
reverend joseph asked us to tell you how sorry he is for your loss
we can come back in a couple of weeks and check in on your f
you don 't understand are you
i don 't know what to do
i need to make peace with this and i can 't
the lord says the UNknown will be thrown into the lake of fire
bobby sinned !
he 'd never UNknown hurt anyone
is that enough ?
i have never asked of you only given as i was told
your holy spirit has taught me so much
but now there 's more i need to know
the bible it says that UNknown is a sin punishable by death
do you believe that ?
there are other UNknown of the bible mrs griffith
my son was gay and he killed himself
is there an other interpretation of that ?
i 'm sorry
my bobby ?
he stopped coming
is UNknown an unforgivable sin ?
UNknown 18 22 says if a man lies with another man it is an abomination
an abomination in that time didn 't mean sin
it meant unclean
or mixing UNknown
and then he says the same thing about an UNknown or a child that UNknown their parents
and we certainly don 't interpret that scripture UNknown
in UNknown 22 if a woman is not a virgin on her wedding day she should be taken to her father 's house and stoned to death
so what do you tell people who come here ?
that it is UNknown in god 's eyes ?
i tell them what i believe to be the truth that god loves them as they are
god 's vengeance is great
so is his compassion
that 's not what the bible says
it just UNknown them more
mrs griffith if you 'd like to come back during the week and talk my door is open but not to be blamed ok ?
i think that we got a pretty good one nice and full
a couple of balls like your dear old dad
i remember when he made this
he was so proud of himself
where do you want to put it ?
hey they work
i found the passage you talked about
about UNknown to death
god UNknown the sin of UNknown
how do you explain that ?
it 's nice to see you too mary
what 's this for ?
it 's a UNknown sale
all gay people have UNknown too
many scholars think this sin was greed and not UNknown
and it wasn 't UNknown UNknown until years after it was written
do you have answers for all these things just to justify being that way ?
you have answers to justify that it 's wrong
i guess we 'r e in an UNknown here
so you think it 's ok to interpret the bible any way you want ?
no of course not
and many of those UNknown were UNknown of the time and what they lived
so you feel completely free to question it ?
i don 't think god minds questions
he might not be thrilled with all our answers
i think blind faith is just as dangerous as none at all
i UNknown e never questioned my faith
sometimes to question it helps you find a deeper faith
bobby stopped coming here
and we didn 't help
it 's a national organisation
it 's parents and friend of UNknown and UNknown
no that 's not for me
they can help
you UNknown l love her
she has a gay son in his UNknown
i just had a few questions
i don 't need anything else
just in case
and i mean UNknown UNknown that UNknown
what i 'm saying is if the church no longer UNknown that UNknown maybe UNknown is also on that list
mary i wasn 't that keen with the first interpretation of the bible
well it could mean that bobby 's in heaven
yeah well he 's not here
is it enough for you ? !
does it make it any better ?
everything you 'r e doing ?
what do you want me to do ?
just forget about him ?
i can 't do that
maybe you can
i want to remember him
then i want to move on
but i can 't !
oh i see
is that what you 'r e saying ?
is that what you think ?
you can answer me !
listen mary we both made mistakes
we all made mistakes
we 'r e not gonna bring him back
i know that !!!
please come in
i can 't imagine what it must feel like to lose a child like that
how long has it been ?
our son was 14 when he came out to us
isn 't that a little young ?
i knew before then
don 't we ?
oh god no
UNknown wasn 't the first word that came to my mind
no i 'm
so don 't talk
i UNknown l think about it
eric was UNknown in UNknown all the time
mary you came
that 's great
but he didn 't do a thing to the boys who did it
i was shocked by that
i called them fruits and UNknown
i didn 't know
i think i UNknown knew
he was always different
what do i do ?
i take him hunting
i always knew i could love my son
i never thought i could accept him
for who he is
i insisted she see a UNknown
but when that man suggested shock therapy
i looked at my baby and the hurt in her eyes
i thought this is crazy !
ah hello reverend !
as you may know reverend UNknown is a pastor of the metropolitan community church and he 's proposing a gay freedom day to the walnut creek city council
the city council vote happens in about a month and i would love all your support
you 'r e soak
i was sitting there
about how they always just knew their kid was different
and then i had this dream tonight
bobby was a baby
his difference began at conception
i knew that
he didn 't heal him because there was nothing wrong with him
i did this !
you did not kill your son
bobby killed himself
how could bobby forgive me ?
god has already done the forgiving
you have to forgive yourself
i 'm so sorry !
i 'm so sorry !
i did not decide on brown eyes for myself
and i now realize that bobby didn 't decide to be gay
if you say in your word that it is evil and wicked to be born with no arms and a child is born with no arms
what is that child to think ?
our first order business is a proposal for a gay UNknown day in walnut creek
i don 't see her it 's reverend UNknown
for one day for one day people can celebrate their difference rather than feel shame
they should be UNknown !
there are so many other people who need our time and our attention
why are we wasting it on this ?
they spit in the face of decency and morality
we cannot allow the fabric of our society to be torn apart
they sent him a letter
i said UNknown e sing hymns at our church
what do you do with the hymns at your church ?
so unless anyone else has anything else to add we UNknown l adjourn to make our decision
dad hurry up !
if they wanted to change they could be healed of their evil ways
if they would turn away from temptation they could be normal again
if only they would try and try harder if it doesn 't work
these are all the things i said to my son bobby when i found out he was gay
when he told me he was UNknown my world fell apart
i did everything i could to cure him of his sickness
8 months ago my son jumped off a bridge and killed himself
i deeply regret my lack of knowledge about gay and UNknown people
i see that everything i was taught and told was UNknown and UNknown slender
if i had investigated beyond what i was told if i had just
listened to my son when he poured his heart out to me
i would not be standing here today with you filled with regrets
i believe that god was pleased with bobby 's kind and loving spirit
in god 's eyes kindness and love are what it 's all about
he wanted to be a writer
his hopes and dreams should not have been taken from him but they were
they are children
and that will soon silence their prayers
their prayers to god for understanding and acceptance and for your love
but your hatred and fear and ignorance of the word gay will silence those prayers
so before you echo amen in your home and place of worship
well he UNknown l try again next year right ?
so we 'r e really going to san francisco ?
i think we have to
i don 't think that 's a choice
well that 's ironic
oh ! honey no
i say these words to you as i would with my own precious children
please don 't give up hope on life
i 'm working very hard to make this world a better and safer place for you to live in
promise me you UNknown l keep trying
bobby gave up on love
i hope you won 't
you 'r e always in my gods
my name is bobby griffith
i write this in hope that one day many years from now
her UNknown work protecting the rights of gay and UNknown youth has established her as a major force in the fight for human rights
before you echo amen in your home or place of worship think and remember
a child is listening
there is not one universe
there are many
there is not one you
there are many
there was balance in the system but now a force exists who seeks to destroy the balance so he can become the one
president UNknown addressed congress today where he UNknown the white house plan

the shortest distance between two points will always be a straight line
your line has run out
you don 't see that ?
there 's never been anything like what i have become
you know that
i wish i 'd never let there be a second
but there was a second
and a third
you miss me ?
you UNknown e been chasing me how many years ?
there won 't be a one more time for you
may god be with you
you may make a final statement
i just try to make it rational
i just try to make it neat
you call it murder
i just took those wasted energies and put them into one container me
it made me faster smarter stronger
what if that is our fate ?
to unite with our other selves
to be UNknown forever
gabriel UNknown are you ready ?

people get older

whatever it is we 'r e here now right ?
and if they find something wrong with me ?
i don 't want to lose my job

just like old times eh buddy ?
not exactly buddy
space is shaped like this
you believe this is the only universe
there 's not just one universe there 's a UNknown
every time a massive star dies and becomes a black hole a new universe is created
they UNknown e learned to forecast where and when a black hole will occur
a momentary bridge between parallel UNknown
travel is restricted
i 'm a UNknown agent
you 'r e a nut
you 'r e the one who 's been seeing yourself
in this universe you 'r e you
in another you don 't exist
in another you 'r e married to the same woman
in another to a different woman
in another you 'r e married to a man
there 's an energy strain wave connecting all those lives
we all have one
you UNknown e been feeling him haven 't you ?
harry nobody 's proved that what i 'm doing is a bad thing
you UNknown e killed 123 people
i 'd say that was a very bad thing
you don 't know what 'd happen if you killed this one
it could destroy the system but that doesn 't matter
some people think you 'd explode some people think you 'd UNknown
you 'r e missing one
some people think you 'd become a god
that 's the one
once he was forced to defend himself against himself in another universe
made him stronger
each time he kills one of you the energy UNknown among the survivors
so i 'm next ?
you 'r e the last
you and him are it
i don 't want any part of this
you don 't have a choice
first choice give up
what happens to me ?
nobody 's got all the answers
i don 't believe you

just so you know i 'm going to take that gun and kill you before you can pull the trigger
there 's nothing you can do except give it to me
gabe drop it !
you 'r e acting like him
i am him !
he said until i find my center my circle would never be whole
that day i first saw her in the clinic i came in with a dog that was hit by a car
i knew right away she was my center
she made me whole
in an hour there 's a UNknown UNknown opening
three minute window
he UNknown l try to find you kill you and get back to the hole
that 's where we get him

my own design
fires 25 smart rounds per second
multiple tracking UNknown plus the latest UNknown
each round carries an explosive UNknown with UNknown fuse delays
tracks enters UNknown
hasn 't worked yet
i never had the go ahead to terminate
let me show you how
that UNknown l work too

i UNknown l never get the chance to thank you for UNknown me away
so thank you sir
just making sure you know if we kill him
you have to kill me

the chinese guy was tearing the place apart
UNknown UNknown ten minutes

i won 't be the one but neither will you
UNknown opens in one minute

UNknown opens in 30 seconds

UNknown opens in ten nine eight seven six five four three two one
sir he assisted in UNknown 's capture
he 's from an UNknown universe with no travel passport
he goes back
they UNknown l lock him up for life
he will be cared for watched over
like the other
sir permission to speak permission denied
that order is bullshit !
it doesn 't matter
i have to send you where you belong
it 's procedure
look out !
what happened ?
you are mine
digging for bones
who was he ?
oh yes my son i knew him
what did he do to deserve this ?
i shall tell you about him
he was a man whose life should be remembered as long as this english nation of ours loves its freedom
i first met him when i was a student at oxford
he was the best teacher i ever had the best preacher i ever heard
he UNknown both heart and mind
he found us as boys and led us to manhood
the doctor couldn 't keep silent
he called for drastic changes and that is when his troubles began to mount
the holy father has again sent warning
john UNknown must be got into line quickly and completely
my lord archbishop
we must not fail again this time bishop UNknown
i have assured his holiness that you have the matter under control
the political tide has shifted to our favor your grace
UNknown would have been silenced long ago but for john of UNknown 's protection
now we have the upper hand
besides UNknown 's own words in writing is all the case we need
i will see to it that his holiness is pleased
i am UNknown
i have longed for this opportunity
at my trial at st paul 's a year ago
i did not get to say a single word in my own defense
my UNknown and my opponents argued over protocol
and then the mob UNknown the trial
nothing was settled because nothing was discussed
now at least bishop UNknown has moved this trial to UNknown where god willing we should be free of outside disturbance
i still think the outside disturbance may have saved your life
my dear niece
i 'm worried
i had a terrible dream last night
i dreamt you were alone on an island of rock in the middle of a vast sea
now don 't be afraid are we not in the hands of the lord ?
i expect he has much more for both of us to do
but the UNknown are saying you are a heretic that you UNknown l be seized
it 's certainly like them to plague a good woman with false fears
all the same it will be dangerous
promise me you UNknown l be careful
how often have i been tempted to submit and withdraw my writing
yet just as often i have been led back to the authority of thy holy word
facing this trial
and yet father
i thank thee that thou art altogether wise and gracious
lord give me the wisdom to defend thy word
whatever trials there may be
lend me the grace to endure them
in the name of our risen lord jesus
that my dear john is a question i frequently ponder before entering my classes
he has UNknown you greatly in the past doctor
he has indeed
you may need him more than ever now
we shall soon see
good day to you sheriff
are you about your duties ?
that 's right sir
but it 's the hangman 's rope for him now all right
these young gentlemen your students doctor ?
you can save your insults sheriff
i am not fallen from god 's grace
my sins are as surely forgiven as the sins of any man in england
silence you dog !
please sheriff please let him speak
i am interested to hear what he has to say
god bless you father
then why have you taken to this dishonorable life of stealing ?
well you know as well as i do father
you know the law
but the cost of food goes up all the time
a man just can 't afford to earn an honest living no more
my son i know you believe you have good cause to be bitter but nothing can excuse the breaking of god 's laws
but what did you mean that you are assured the forgiveness of your sins ?
ah well i went to my priest and bought an indulgence paid good money for it too
my priest promised me that i have the stored graces of the holy church for my forgiveness
i may be a thief father but i UNknown e always been a good christian
well tell me this good christian did jesus sell UNknown like yours ?
well my indulgence is good i tell ya !
man the forgiveness of god is not to be purchased by a few coins
yes but i paid good money
my priest promised the indulgence was good
what are you saying that it 's worthless ?
believe me my son
no indulgence can do that
i will ask the sheriff to send for my vicar at UNknown church and he will hear your confession and help you find true repentance
it is never too late
the UNknown thief who died next to christ upon the cross got the best assurance of all
today christ told him
that thief needed no indulgence
he needed only to turn to christ
they say in the village that one of you be a great doctor of the church
if that be so may a poor man ask for some help ?
how can i help you sir ?
i do not ask for money doctor just a little of your time
how can i be of service ?
tis my wife that needs the help doctor
she is beside herself with grief for the boy child we had last year that died
i try to reason with her and comfort her but my words avail as little as a cold wind
she will not be comforted
so many of the little ones die you know
has your wife spoken to the parish priest ?
that 's the pity of it father
the babe was not baptized
not baptized ?
there was a special levy from the church for the pope 's army and i had no money for a donation
and the priest would not baptize without a donation ?
and before i could earn money the poor babe was carried off by a fever
many months have passed but my poor wife spends every day in weeping
will you help her good sir ?
may the lord bless you and give you peace my daughter
i thank you for your kindness good doctor
but my heart is so broken it will not be comforted
you see sir what did i tell you ?
god will bring peace to your mind and your heart if you will only give him leave
his love is especially lent to broken hearts like yours
father i will tell you why my heart aches sore
some months ago a traveling UNknown came through our village and this friar told me that the spirits of UNknown infants are cursed to wander as UNknown
he told you that ?
i fear that maybe the spirit of my own poor lost child is there
woman you know that god has given us a holy book to lead us into all truth
the bible father ?
yes father in the mystery plays at festival time
his story is told us in the scriptures and the book reveals that one day the great king david had one of his own baby children grow sick and die
and when the child was dead david rose up and said
my child will not return to me but i shall go one day to be with him
and that was many years before the institution of baptism
oh doctor you speak so UNknown but how shall i know that one day
i shall go to be with my child ?
keep you eyes fixed on that other babe born so many years ago in bethlehem whose death did break the heart of his own dear mother the holy virgin
keep in your heart that christ died to purchase our souls by his hard suffering on the bitter cross
and remember that he rose again at easter to call us to himself in glory
their countenance changes in your very presence
ah but notice mr UNknown it is the sharing of the scriptures that gives the comfort is it not ?
well we are less than one hour from john of UNknown 's
we shall soon see what words of comfort he has in store for us
i cannot save you again
i came to your rescue at st paul 's but at UNknown you will go alone
my lord i
it is only a few short months since the death of my beloved father
our dear richard is no more than a puppet in the hands of ambitious men men who are afraid
lest i should UNknown their UNknown power
now is not the time to have john of UNknown
duke of lancaster at your side
however though i shall not be present to pluck you out of trouble again
i would give you a little instruction how to UNknown yourself at UNknown
for god 's sake UNknown you 'r e sometimes so naive
this time you must try and grasp the politics of the situation
my lord your advice is always welcome but politics is your lordship 's study not my own
so you have always said
i remember when my father sent you as a delegate to the peace conference in UNknown
your arguments were good and sound but your approach so stiff and UNknown
even now you still do not comprehend the thrust and parry of politics
like a duel or battle
fight a political enemy UNknown ting
as you would a military enemy with tactics UNknown ting
when to defend UNknown ting
and when to beat an honorable retreat
be off with you !
UNknown have you been listening man ?
i hear you my lord but i cannot see how this applies to my case
then let us be a little more specific
at UNknown palace your most dangerous enemy will not be UNknown but bishop UNknown
he seeks your down fall he makes no secret of it
do not let your quick tongue fill his quiver with arrows for your own destruction
be diplomatic be moderate
my lord knows that i shall speak truly and remain steadfast in my opinions
that is exactly what i expected you to say
you and your saxon stubbornness !
my lord would prefer me to exercise norman UNknown ?
oh if this were still an age of champions !
yes i know
you have helped restore to the crown its dignity and prerogative as derived from god
maybe now at last we shall see an end to the dominion of UNknown and UNknown
this english nation will be a mighty one when it finds the will to rouse itself
saxon or norman we stand or fall as englishmen
but the point i make in my writing is that lordship comes from god and can only be UNknown as by a steward in his service
i confess i 'm sometimes appalled by the UNknown that political men put upon my words
yet i have written nothing but what i have learnt in god 's law
make no mistake ;
as you will argue no doubt at UNknown in your customary UNknown manner
circumstances will govern my actions my lord as the young squire 's UNknown governed yours a few moments ago
UNknown you are UNknown and i love you for it
stick to your scriptures then and be a david to bring down the goliath UNknown
and may you conquer for he 's a tool of rome and his ambition would enslave us all
fear not great duke
well and good doctor
my lord ?
you have heard the UNknown
you are satisfied that your teachings have been accurately presented to this court ?
i deny only that they are unorthodox
we would have you questioned by bishop UNknown who has studied UNknown the merits of your UNknown
dr UNknown we rejoice that you have UNknown to obey our summons
and i rejoice that you have studied UNknown my UNknown
i have taught that all dominion comes equally from god and can only be rightfully UNknown in obedience to god
should the church UNknown or UNknown misuse its powers then the civil authorities would have the right and the duty to correct that abuse
and who will be judge of this ?
that same civil authority ?
indeed dr UNknown is not this famous theory of dominion a mere justification for the crown to UNknown the property and prerogative of the church ?
no my lord it is not
but in the matter of property seeing that you refer to it
i see no basis in the word of god for the church to possess extreme material wealth
ah can it be that dr UNknown is jealous that he has not received the share that his great talents deserve ?
one third of the land of england is owned by the church my lord bishop
such ownership is not the business of the church
christ and his apostles lived in poverty
might we not do well to imitate their example ?
by presenting them perhaps to the english nobility ?
i 'm sure the duke of lancaster and his party could put them to good use
no my lord bishop but i do have a suggestion
your own mouth UNknown you UNknown
first you seek to undermine the authority of the church of the UNknown and even of the pope
and now you instruct us how best to bring about our own downfall
you leave little room for doubt what the verdict of this court must be
one last question dr UNknown what spiritual authority would replace the one that you have just so UNknown demolished ?
your own UNknown brain ?
no bishop UNknown
brothers in christ this is a letter from our queen mother
joan of kent
her majesty declares that dr john UNknown has rendered long and valued service to the crown that which she asks this court to recognize
further she requests that there be no UNknown of dr UNknown
and UNknown she requests that this court shall refrain from UNknown any final judgment
no right bishop UNknown no right ?
the queen mother has spoken and we shall listen respectfully
we will confine ourselves to the consideration of the points at issue in dr UNknown 's UNknown and refrain from any judgment of the man himself
queen mother would not have written so without his UNknown
so once again UNknown escapes our grasp
you would have delighted in his destruction my lord
do you think i relish this conflict ?
i would rather have UNknown with us than against us
he 's a brilliant man his life is UNknown his devotion to god beyond question
dangerously attractive qualities
he is a heretic and he must be silenced
if he is not checked his voice could poison all of UNknown
it is said his following grows daily
his name and influence spread like the plague
you have heard my lord of the many UNknown priests he has sent into the countryside to preach the scriptures
considering what a mockery so much of the preaching of our UNknown and UNknown has become of late
i can hardly condemn him for that
sometimes i wonder is mine the only voice to be raised in defense of the true church ?
what is to be done when at the head is such a weak tool ?
UNknown blows hot and cold with every puff of wind
he 's a coward
very true brother mark
you have some action in mind ?
oxford is the key
without the endorsement of the academic world the nobility will find them less attractive
ideas are only as powerful as the men that hold them
besides if the peasants get anymore troublesome than they are already the nobility will be the first to cry for law and order
and where will they turn for help ?
to the church
pope gregory died and chaos UNknown
the church broke apart with the election of two rival UNknown
england and most of europe went with pope urban vi in rome
france and a few allies supported pope clement UNknown in UNknown
in the confusion that followed
john UNknown was left free to continue his writing
his ideas grew more and more bold
what a hunt we had today
you should have seen us
two UNknown dead within the first hour
the second nearly got poor UNknown
but why such a grim face ?
we were discussing this new book fresh from the UNknown father
it arrived the day before yesterday
well if a book will take away my daughter 's pretty smile
i regret that i ever allowed her to be taught her letters
oh it must be very serious indeed
well father it is by your old chaplain
why father haven 't you heard ?
this book is UNknown 's attack on the church UNknown on UNknown
against the mass ?
squire UNknown !
noble duke !
you have dared to attack the UNknown of UNknown the very central UNknown of the church ?
yes my lord i have
is that all you have to say you wretched UNknown ?
you stand there in your bearded innocence and simply say yes my lord
man an attack on UNknown is an attack on the mass
an attack on the mass is an attack on the foundation of the holy church
retract retract it at once
my lord the holy scriptures tell us that jesus christ is the foundation of the church
don 't quibble doctor
i think not my lord
UNknown is a modern UNknown unknown to the fathers of the church
pope innocent ill and the fourth UNknown council first proclaimed it
less than 200 years ago
i care not when it was proclaimed
it is believed believed throughout the whole of UNknown
my noble duke the fact that something is believed by the UNknown does not necessarily make it true
yes my liege i think that i do
we have known each other for many years
a great many years
god rest his soul i wish he was alive today
john you know well the hold you now have upon the hearts of the people of this nation
if you do not UNknown this folly a wound may open which might never heal
already there is rebellion in the air
my nephew richard is surround by fools and UNknown
my lords of gloucester and UNknown pull the strings upon which he dances and they are dangerous men
i am fearful of what chaos may be let UNknown in england
you do well to be fearful my lord
the poor of this realm have suffered too much too long
and you would do well to be fearful if you persist in this new teaching
i can do no more
your stubbornness puts you at UNknown 's mercy
i can only continue the work i have begun
man may attack the body my lord not the soul
you would not have me buy the protection of UNknown by selling my soul
may god bless your courage john
my lord it has been my privilege to serve you all these years
i thank you for all you have done to shield me
if you have to step back from me now have no fear
the lord will be my shield
i might not see your face again
god keep us then till we meet in his kingdom
their leader john ball has escaped from prison
that can only mean trouble
we have no business being here
how many times have i appealed on behalf of the poor of this country nicholas ?
i 'm identified with their cause
why should i not speak to these peasants when they ask to meet me ?
they are on the brink of UNknown
if it is believed that you helped to fan the flames
well let us at least ask what they have to say
yes as you asked
for all our sakes doctor
we take a certain risk in talking to you and we know that you be in some considerable danger
your poor preachers come into our villages and tell the bible stories
they be our friends
we think you 'r e on our side
i think my friend
well answer me this then
who is right ?
you are fully justified in what you say
it 's time things were changed
aye it 's time for a change
it 's time to overthrow the tyrants
doctor we are many thousand strong
every man amongst us knows and honors your name
if you would help us
the purpose of my life is to help all god 's people
but tell me is it true that john ball has escaped from prison ?
you know about that ?
as a matter of fact yes it is so sir
then it is he who has stirred up this revolt ?
oh he may have stirred it up but the pot has been brewing for a long time now
he knows what to do
brothers listen !
he came to overthrow tyranny but not with the methods of tyranny
his kingdom will prevail
words words the time for words is past
now is the time for weapons to speak
consider i beg you
what made us think that this fine oxford gentleman would dirty his hands in our cause ?
he doesn 't care
i don 't care you say i don 't care
how many times have i spoken for your cause ?
pleaded on your behalf for mercy that your wrongs might be UNknown
i UNknown e appealed to the church begged them to look to the needs of the poor !
and now my church UNknown me
i 'm UNknown for my efforts by the civil authorities the royal court UNknown me and you say i do not care !
you must understand the way of violence is not christ 's way cannot be my way nor should it be the way of any christian man
you are a good man sir
we are not evil men neither
your priests have shown us the way of christ and we want to follow it
but it won 't put wool on our backs nor bread in our mouths
religious talk can 't stop us now
there 's been too much talk with too little results
my brothers wait our lord was not of the landed gentry
he was a common man a carpenter who left his trade to become a servant to others
he washed his disciple 's feet
if you let him
we will see things change believe me we will
you UNknown e got to understand sir it 's gone on for too long far too long
now we fight !
thousands of the poor marched on london smashing every authority except that of the young king
the nobility and many in the church began to hold john UNknown to blame for the revolt
it was charged that his UNknown made the peasants think that they were important in the eyes of god and thus they might have earthly rights too
simon UNknown the archbishop of canterbury was beheaded by the mob and in the UNknown
pope urban appointed thomas UNknown as the new archbishop of canterbury
with the supreme UNknown power in england in his hands at last
archbishop UNknown wasted no time in moving against UNknown
to chancellor UNknown at oxford without delay
so john UNknown let 's see whose master now
since my appointment i UNknown e fought for your liberty to teach what you would within these walls
UNknown condemned by the UNknown court teaching forbidden by the UNknown council but it couldn 't last we both knew that
UNknown has appointed a council of 12 to UNknown the university
my authority is by license of that council
they have issued their first orders
see for yourself
i do not wish to submit god knows
you have no choice chancellor
while the university remains an arm of the church you have no choice
if you resist
the university will lose all its hard won privileges
if i do not lose mine
precisely though i fear that won 't be the end of the matter
other heads will roll i 'm sure of that probably mine too
they have no regard for this place as the greatest center of learning in the christian world
they care only for UNknown and proper obedience
so i am to be forbidden to teach
and am i also to be denied access to the libraries for my studies ?
that is undoubtedly what the council has in view
john its intention is simply to cut you off from everything you UNknown e stood for
how can i continue my work ?
alas my old friend
UNknown i did not see you there
you two are near the end of your studies are you not ?
you UNknown l be returning to your homeland before long ?
whilst we have been at oxford we have copied all your work
every one of them
we copy everything
what should i say ?
i 'm astonished and delighted
sir bohemia is such a beautiful country
in prague your name is already famous
won 't you come with us ?
things are so sad for you here now
we hear you are forbidden to teach
there is danger for you here
in prague you would be honored as you deserve
a moment ago i was in deep despair and now i 'm full of joy
i thank god for two such good friends
your invitation UNknown me
please come with us
i think there 's still work for me to do here in england
we promise doctor whatever happens here in england you your teaching will live on in the fortress mountains of bohemia
how marvelous are god 's ways
may he ever continue to do his work through you my dear sons in christ
you see in a way i do go with you to your homeland
yes oh yes
thy will be done
why not ?
rector of UNknown ?
perhaps it 's about time considering the number of sermons i UNknown e preached against UNknown UNknown
oh you know full well you UNknown e never neglected your UNknown duties neither there nor at oxford
last night in my prayers
i suddenly saw quite clearly the divine hand of providence was guiding me back to UNknown
as pastor ?
as a scholar sir what do you mean ?
over the centuries that authority has been UNknown UNknown and now our nation our whole people our civilization UNknown for lack of the word of god
how can men live under the authority of god 's word if they do not know god 's word ?
the UNknown most of them do not even know their latin
they know still less of god 's word
my task now our task if you will
most of your students will want to help
there will be no lack of workers
you realize the shock waves this will send through the UNknown not to mention your opponents at canterbury
you already stand accused of heresy
UNknown the bible will be seen by some as nothing less than UNknown against our mother church
but i see it as nothing less than my sacred duty as a loyal son of christ 's church
it 's so plain to me now
how did we ever lose it ?
the new testament was written in the UNknown greek the language of the people
st jerome 's latin UNknown translation was in the common tongue
are englishmen to be deprived of the word of god because it is locked up in a foreign language ?
how can we keep a faithful church without the word of god as its bread for hungry souls ?
my dream is to see the UNknown fire of god 's word UNknown in the hearts and minds of all our people all our people
and with you forrest
day after day close attention to the holy scriptures became for us a source of revelation and constantly new UNknown into the truth of god 's law
our hearts were set UNknown with the word of god
the research translation and UNknown of that word became not a task but a supreme act of worship
throughout this time
now the word had to be taken to the people
UNknown suffered a stroke which left him partly crippled
but he would not permit his affliction to disrupt his work
you know all of you that i first began to send out my little flock of poor priests during my years at oxford
they were a gallant band but after my UNknown
i never thought to UNknown over such a UNknown again
yet here you are my brave new flock
i bless you and oh how much i thank god for you
within this bill we have uncovered the UNknown UNknown of this UNknown UNknown john UNknown
when shall we be spared the venom of his pen the subversive threat of his presence ?
see for yourselves how low he has sunk
this man of former great reputation the jewel of oxford famed throughout europe for his knowledge of the scriptures and the fathers
look now at his depraved teachings
he attacks the very foundation of the church
he declares it lawful for any man to preach the word of god UNknown the necessity of the authorization of the UNknown see
this UNknown will have the people hear preaching from any common man who can open a copy of the scriptures
UNknown is called to be a steward of god
every man is responsible to god for what he does with his life
every man must stand alone before the final judgment of god
god has given us the scriptures that we should learn how to think and believe and live
he has been condemned for a heretic forbidden to UNknown his UNknown UNknown in pulpit or school
that he and his UNknown have been engaged from the moment he went to UNknown in UNknown the holy scriptures into the common english tongue
shall god 's law which has come down to us in the language of learning be so UNknown so stripped of majesty so UNknown of meaning ?
how shall the vulgar tongue of common man UNknown convey its wisdom ?
do we really dare to give the word of god in the common tongue into the hands of the common people ?
do we fully understand what we are doing ?
will some not abuse misuse and UNknown the scriptures ?
my brethren of course some will
but has keeping the scriptures as the property of the UNknown and UNknown prevented misuse ?
we will give god 's word to god 's children and his spirit will guide them
it will take time for growth and understanding but i fear what judgment may befall us if we dare not give out this word
did not the blessed st UNknown declare that is was necessary only for god 's ordained to understand the holy scriptures ?
that they alone should communicate this knowledge ?
god has committed the treasure of his word to the keeping of his holy church that ignorant men should not UNknown them to their own damnation
it is reported your grace that UNknown 's intention is to release another band of ragged preachers upon the countryside this time armed with copies of the new translation
then they must be stopped
it shall be ordered that under king richard 's seal and upon UNknown from a bishop that henceforth all UNknown priests shall be arrested and imprisoned
my friends the way will be hard
hunger bitter cold foul words physical attack await you
it may be you will be persecuted imprisoned then like christ you will turn the other cheek if need be again and again
love him and serve him always
therein lies your strength
he shall at last be delivered into our hands for the judgment and UNknown he deserves
narrator UNknown never appeared at the third trial
he suffered another stroke whilst attending mass which left him paralyzed
the trial went on in his absence anyway but was interrupted but a rare and violent earthquake
both UNknown 's followers and UNknown 's saw in it the hand of god 's judgment on the other
it must and it will
the time must come when by god 's grace every man and every woman in this kingdom must have the word of god in the english language in their heart
severe persecution followed
UNknown some of us did but some of us later renounced our UNknown
but why do they dig up his grave ?
why do they burn his bones ?
but they UNknown
they burnt his bones to ashes and cast them into swift a UNknown brook running hard by
thus this brook hath conveyed his ashes into UNknown
UNknown into UNknown
and thus the ashes of UNknown are the emblem of his UNknown which now is UNknown the world over
have i told you recently that you 'r e beautiful ?
isn 't my girlfriend perfect ?
oh no !

girl you have to give me the recipe for that dip

probably an appropriate neurosis of a UNknown subconscious that reflects in that UNknown attitude that solely depends on the actions of UNknown childhood UNknown

the smell that some parts of the female give off UNknown the male 's

come on i UNknown l introduce you
no i don 't want to meet the blond !
what if she falls in love with me ?
no i 'm in love with you
news is that a few rats have crossed over into our territory from the UNknown
lf you notice any suspicious activity get in touch with me immediately and pass me the information
not to worry sir
lieutenant UNknown come in
sir i UNknown e a problem
not been able to establish radio contacts with both my patrols for last two weeks
there is absolutely no news of them
this is the cause of worry sir
now you do one thing colonel
wait for my further order
and please don 't send anymore search parties
let me talk to higher command
and i UNknown l get back to you
over and out
it was so dark couldn 't tell where the enemy was
the UNknown and the UNknown troops have crossed the UNknown and UNknown several kilometers into our territory
from this information it looks like they 'r e all over the place
the UNknown valley the UNknown sector and the UNknown sector
they UNknown e taken over the whole lndian territory
and they have occupied our UNknown too
the rations our troops had left behind in the UNknown is what they 'r e feeding off to attack us !
the problem is that they 'r e watching the national highway number one through point UNknown UNknown and UNknown and continuously shelling our UNknown
situation is very serious
to cut of kashmir from UNknown by hitting national highway number one
orders from delhi are very clear
the maximum UNknown must take place in the UNknown sector
orders are to press maximum number of battalions into service
and as we know with the enemy sitting up there at an UNknown position requiring us to attack them from down below
so the ratio will be 6 1
we UNknown l lose six they UNknown l lose one
and UNknown terrain is such where the ratio will be 10 1
and that the reason why maximum UNknown is taking place
sir let us cross the UNknown and cut off the enemy from behind
so that we lose less lives
we UNknown l get into UNknown territory and cut off all their lines of supply
that we UNknown l be going by the book
at no point of time we UNknown l cross the line of control
these are the clear instruction from delhi
and so let 's move 1 11 UNknown regiment first
but the 1 11 UNknown regiment has just returned from UNknown sir
can 't help it
colonel UNknown rai will take command of the 1 11 UNknown
let me talk to him
and take charge of 1 11 UNknown regiment
i UNknown l be there sir
UNknown hind sir
here come the UNknown !
the UNknown regiment is known for its bravery !
my brave friends battle and bloodshed aren 't unknown to us
we saw kashmir bathed in blood recently !
the UNknown regiment is famous all over the world
even hitler had once said
lf i can have the UNknown troops
i can conquer the entire world
and as your commanding officer
UNknown rai wants to see you victorious in UNknown !
any doubts ?
here come the UNknown !
colonel UNknown move your battalion 18 grenadiers to UNknown UNknown sector immediately
stop all operation in kashmir valley and proceed immediately
had you got into it you 'd have been taken too
scared aren 't you ?
he was armed to his teeth
he could UNknown e killed you
and i 'm a UNknown a real man
we don 't get scared
we give others a scare
and i 'm a UNknown from UNknown
i only hit out
pig headed guys
and battalion is moving forward to UNknown sector
the UNknown UNknown which is our territory and on which we have a post has been captured by the enemy
from there the enemy is keeping a watch on national highway number one
they are monitoring every move our UNknown are making and keeping an eagle 's eye on their activities
it 's very necessary for us to UNknown the enemy from there
we UNknown e got to launch an attack on them
they sent a couple of battalions up there
the 16 grenadiers are presently engaged in combat over there
the task is now being entrusted to us and head quarters wants us to accept it
as if there are only a dozen UNknown sitting out there !
the UNknown battalion has already got there sir
something is surely fishy sir
nobody 's telling us the whole truth
lf we are issued orders we UNknown l definitely launch an offensive sir
but the enemy 's at such a height every grenade they UNknown at us will come down at lightning speed sir
besides we have no information about the enemy sir
are they 8 in number or 800 ?
even if there are 8000 troops out there they UNknown e gotten into our house !
and we UNknown l surely throw them out sir !
easier said than done !
lf we 'r e a family you 'r e like the father among us
so why are you UNknown us to the path of cowardice ?
and that too blindfolded !
when a child walks through a dark alley he sings and whistles out of fright
we UNknown l go out singing too sir
the same old song my mother keeps humming
so lover boy tell me the truth what 's going to happen ?
sir wrong grammar sir
sir let us have your orders
the battalion is ready
UNknown hind sir
what else can one steal here ?
it 's either the splendour of nature or the chill of ice
never said the true word
now tell me what happened in the mission ?
there were four of them sir
all UNknown UNknown
you must have interrogated him then ?
i did sir
for god 's sake shoot me why ?
he said that if he lived people of his UNknown group would kill him
but if he died his wife and kids would be paid 300 000 rupees
so it was shoot me for god 's sake
i asked him who would pay them the money ? and he said the UNknown group
sir the UNknown of afghanistan have got as far as the UNknown UNknown sir
a lot of movement is being observed in pakistan occupied kashmir sir
we must inform brigade headquarter
that we UNknown l do UNknown
the battalion is moving to UNknown
of course UNknown
i had leave all right sir
but i alone know how i UNknown e spent it
what happened ?
they were mostly from the UNknown battalion sir
deepak our battalion is headed to where these coffins are coming from
it 's to avenge those coffins that i UNknown e returned before time sir
deepak sir the enemy will now lie in coffins
let 's hope so
thank you sir
you take command of 13 j k rifles battalion
i go to be the commanding officer of battalion sir
that 's right
now your task move to UNknown UNknown sector
the battalion 's moving towards the UNknown sector
where 's UNknown UNknown ?
he had gone with the patrol party
we had information that some terrorists were holed up in a village five kilometers from here
he had gone after them
when did he go ?
four days ago
of course UNknown
but by the time they got there he had already left
0 and the idiot didn 't even try to get in touch with us
i hope the patrol party is okay !
their security is our responsibility
let 's get him on the radio
we UNknown e reached base camp
hey superman !
where the hell were you ?
know what ?
where did you slip away ?
it 's the terrorists who slipped away
the places i looked for them !
it 's a man 's calling to face trouble not to run away from it
you are crazy
where 's the battalion going ?
that 's nice
i UNknown l go and report
i 'm okay
yes i went to your house too
your wife sent some UNknown
will give them to you later
you asked about my mother ?
she 's all right
oh yes she found a bride for me this time
so what else is happening ?
what else ?
the major has returned ?
you mean he has returned from the advanced post in UNknown ?
i got a feeling from the news on radio that this is serious business
whether this is minor trouble or major we UNknown l know only when we get there
sir when do we move ?
we have to reach UNknown in 48 hours
we UNknown l be ready sir
let 's move
i came away immediately
how 's your mother keeping ?
she 's all right sir
whenever we had a guest we extended our hospitality to him
even when someone came uninvited we still treated him to food and sent him away
when an animal strayed into our colony we drove it away with a stick
but whenever a cheetah or a wolf came UNknown we always shot it dead
something similar has happened in our house today
a pack of wolves have got into our house
you tell me how are they to be treated ?
kill them !
so give me your word
that we will not return until we have accomplished our task
are you firm in your resolve ?
yes we are firm in our resolve !
brother dear this is an amazing thing to happen
the laddie is playing bridegroom
he leads the bridal procession sending a shiver down every spine
so bridegroom you 'r e here ?
you are the limit !
this is the first time you 'r e meeting me after your marriage
so how was it ?
mom found a bride for me and i got married that 's it
how 's the bride ?
so she 's beautiful !

so what have you brought for me buddy ?
now come to the point
so soldier UNknown singh UNknown
how come ?
so am i
i got a UNknown note for the wedding
i 'm glad it came here to me
had it fallen in my wife 's hands she 'd have cried my husband has got married again !
she 'd have left for this place with a stick and poor me would have taken all god gave me !
you 'd have got a nice beating from your wife !
the UNknown were okay you know
ln fact it was all very nice
but when i woke up early in the morning i had a terrible nightmare
but UNknown boy
i thrashed them all on my own and drove them away
your dreams are as black as your tongue !
your dream has come true
not you alone we 'r e all going together to save the UNknown
do what you will
we UNknown l send them back to where they came from !
we UNknown e seen the peacock dance
we UNknown e seen the heaviest of UNknown
and now the drains tell the sea
learn to rage !
brother dear this is an amazing thing to happen
the laddie is playing the bridegroom

maybe god has given me an opportunity
to sacrifice my life in order to protect my friends
don 't you dare heap curse on my beloved that too before we are married
i UNknown l come back and marry you
you and i will then talk about giving birth to babies okay ?
go away !
my battalion has left for UNknown
i 'm told there are signs of an UNknown war there
i 'm a soldier after all
and only the fortunate soldiers get to see action on the battlefield
whenever you talk about battle my heart begins to sink
don 't you dare mrs UNknown you will not shed a single tear
i want to carry memories of your smiling face with me
i thought you were asleep
i knew you 'd be leaving early in the morning so i couldn 't go to sleep all night
i heard everything
i didn 't want to disturb anyone
lf UNknown had woken up she wouldn 't have let me leave
but you 'd still have gone away
to your other family
the soldiers in my battalion you and UNknown
and whose support do i have ?
you have a protector
why not ?
and i think i 'm the one he has chosen
all right but do take care of yourself
don 't worry
i won 't let it either !
even if death comes calling
i UNknown l confront it
aunt my battalion has left UNknown for UNknown
i UNknown e got to leave too
lf something happens to you it UNknown l be the end of this family
mine is a huge family mother
the entire lndian army is guarding it
lf not now when again will i go to defend my motherland ?
give me your blessings
all right son
and so the coward UNknown her eyes with tears already ?
all right i 'm a coward
not someone brave like you to send you to face the gun with a smile
nothing will happen to me silly
your love is a shield i 'm wearing
you 'r e trying to humour me ?
lf not for anyone else it UNknown l be only for you
do come lf something happens to you the world will call me a witch who swallowed her fiance
you 'r e so worried about the world aren 't you ?
my world begins and ends with you
this time i 'm serious
serious about you
lf you think i 'm lying you may go away
what do you plan to do in life ?
join the army
i 'm very impressed mr UNknown UNknown
you know UNknown ?
will you be able to live with that ?
don 't you think you are moving too fast ?
i want this relationship to be more than a mere friendship
i want to give our friendship a name will you be able to live with it ?
now you look in my eyes and tell me what do they say ?
mr UNknown UNknown
what will happen in the future ?

lieutenant UNknown UNknown you are an officer
behave like one
yes ma 'a m
yes i will
forget it mother
mother your son 's joining the army where huge bombs are going to explode
will you come to kiss his hand there ?
when you say such things i feel very scared son
look at him he has burnt his hand
show it to her
what does that mean ?
he knows what i 'm talking about
he won 't let me do anything for him
he makes the tea on his own
he himself UNknown the water for a shave
he UNknown the buttons on his shirt
and he uses a brush to string his pajamas
and if i 'm not looking he will himself sit down and wash his own clothes
mother you did everything for me till i grew up
now when i can do it on my own why must i make you do it ?
general UNknown UNknown some chores are meant only for women
absolutely right !
it UNknown l make you happy and my burden will be taken care of too
where do you find such daughters in law nowadays mother ?
that 's UNknown
where to ?
i UNknown l wait till the broth is cooked !
lsn 't she nice ?
she 's crazy !
the borders summon you
the borders summon you
someone waits for you don 't ever forget
without you every moment i shall spend in agony tormented by separation
with you o soldier my heart my heart
the boundaries UNknown you walk on o traveler
the borders summon you
colder than ice darker than charcoal shall be the festival of UNknown without you
the clouds will learn to shed tears
the showers will only cause a fire and pining and what shall yearn to have the fires UNknown
is my heart my heart
the boundaries UNknown you walk on o traveler
the borders summon you
your chair shall remain bare the flowers will remain thirsty
the whole family shall yearn to see you
this courtyard shall call out to you with its arms spread wherever you go my heart beat will go with you
and my heart my heart
the boundaries UNknown you walk on o traveler
the borders summon you
without you every moment i shall spend in agony tormented by separation
with you o soldier goes my heart
my heart my heart
the borders summon you
please be careful sir
be on alert
this can 't be the work of mere UNknown sir
to blow up an ammunition pile and the tv tower with artillery the artillery fire 's all coming from the UNknown 's isn 't it sir ?
your guess is right UNknown
but you must save your anger and your strength for the enemy
i 'm only angry with myself sir
how did the enemy cross the UNknown and get in in the first place ?
there were a few UNknown lying vacant on the UNknown
since the owners weren 't around they seemed up for grabs
that 's all right sir
even if the milk isn 't covered the dog must know where to stop
the UNknown !
there 's shelling on the national highway sir !
UNknown we had information that they and some UNknown what do you call them ?
UNknown screw them !
i was told some rats had got in
ls that the sound of the rats ?
UNknown maybe these rats are going to bother us
UNknown UNknown one after the other !
glory to krishna !
sir neither has anyone seen the enemy nor heard them
who they are and in what numbers no one knows
all we see is a hail of bullets and hear the cries of those who are dying
the injured soldier must UNknown e told you something ?
they don 't even know whether the ones up there are human or beasts dogs or wolves !
dogs and wolves don 't use rocket UNknown and rifles UNknown
these men must be the crazy UNknown you have seen in the valley
the sort of UNknown they are using clearly suggests that the UNknown forces are giving them full support
this is a serious situation
those firing from up there could be just 4 in number or even four thousand
we are being thrust into a wreck we know nothing about
when one is UNknown in the darkness if not a torch one must at least have a candle sir
UNknown if you are so fond of asking questions why did you join the army ?
you ought to have gone to parliament or another government assembly
i 'm sorry sir
to understand the enemy we must learn the terrain
i need UNknown with me sir
sure but after three days of UNknown
now if anyone of you have any questions or doubts ask me right now
after this no questions
we UNknown l identify the enemy
i promise you
i need help to get it out sir
let 's go and see
c 'm on boys let 's move
which battalion are they from ?
they 'r e the dead bodies of officers and soldiers from the UNknown regiment and the grenadiers
we 'r e taking them to delhi from UNknown
i will avenge every death !
right now i 'm not thinking of revenge
i 'm thinking of their families in whose courtyard the bodies of these martyrs will be laid
looks like there 's a lot of trouble brewing in the UNknown sector sir
let 's put the coffins inside
our information said it was about a hundred UNknown
it was wrong
supported by pakistan 's fifth northern light UNknown
take some men to the right
right away sir
all clear sir !
why don 't we make this our base camp ?
brigadier UNknown singh has issued orders that a company of our UNknown regiment will help the 3 UNknown battalion and the 16 grenadiers
very well sir
because of the enemy 's power of resistance
enemy at UNknown is very powerful
a man in fire power
who could be better than you to battle the enemy wrestler UNknown ?
i want you to take a company and proceed towards UNknown
very well sir
even if don 't get any rations there should be no lack of UNknown sir
i UNknown l make sure of that
i want you to be fully prepared
very well sir
tomorrow we UNknown l move at six hundred hours
six hundred hours it will be sir
we have been entrusted a mission that won 't bring relaxation anywhere near us
our target will be the UNknown post
soldiers of the 3 UNknown and the 16 grenadiers have been trying to capture the post at UNknown for the past few days
but such is the fire and confidence of the enemy that our soldiers haven 't been able to move further at all
we UNknown e got to rush to their help
i know it 's not an easy job
but looking at the confidence bravery and history of the UNknown regiment it doesn 't seem difficult either
any doubts ?
which means some of us are not going to return sir
each and every one of us will return
ln whatever state he is
that 's UNknown UNknown 's promise to you
we will not leave behind a single friend
any doubts ?
death is a bride that picks and chooses the most handsome of UNknown
then i don 't stand any chance sir
i 'm not handsome at all !
that 's what you think UNknown
you must ask your mother how good looking you are
sir we UNknown e established contact with 3 UNknown !
how far away are they ?
they appear to be close by sir
take positions !
ask for the link up code
bravo one for alfa one
link of UNknown
ls he saying in UNknown 's care or is it UNknown 's banks ?
he said care sir
bravo one for alfa one
what news ?
and they never returned
didn 't you go in search of your companions ?
we gained control of this position with great difficulty
the brigade doesn 't want the enemy to take control of this position which will take them further
we UNknown l take this route up there
not this route sir
this is the route i will take
hello UNknown listen
that 's the crazy lover
what luck darling !
and wonder of wonders
we 'r e engaged
and then ?
i UNknown l tell you
the marriage will take place in UNknown
and the honeymoon 's happening in tiger hills
but the warmth of your love helps me battle the chill
wow ! ls that a new brand of heater ?
not really but having heard you speak on the telephone
i UNknown e got to know a bit about you
and having heard your rubbish
i UNknown e got to know how insolent you are
captain UNknown UNknown
don 't mind him
lf i have hurt your feelings i apologise
oh yes you 'r e newly married
at least have a word with the poor girl
tell me something is it enough that you just talk to her ?
that only a married man would be able to tell sir
and you aren 't even married yet
all i know is that my folks are waiting for UNknown to visit them on vacation so that they can handcuff him in marriage !
ln which case the two of us are sailing in the same boat sir
i couldn 't resist myself when i overheard your conversation
i must leave to unite with my beloved
he 's turned a poet !
get married sir
praised be krishna
how are you UNknown ?
glory to him !
am eating want some ?
c 'm on
hasn 't UNknown brought anything to eat ?
i have sir loads of it
but not to be eaten
to be fed
i UNknown l feed the UNknown
don 't tell me
i carried a lot of slugs sir
the UNknown are starving for the bullets nowadays
looks like this is where the action took place
watch out there could be UNknown !
watch out for UNknown
even if life has deserted him the soldier still has his gun
he 's been dead for many days
he belonged to the 16 grenadiers sir
which means the rest of the missing patrol party must be somewhere around
to begin with make arrangements to take the bodies down
get the stretcher
nothing will happen to you !
i UNknown e been hit sir !
you will be all right UNknown !
we UNknown e contacted the company behind us sir !
tell them that we need immediate UNknown !
till then we UNknown l hold on to our positions
any doubt ?
go ahead take them away
you can roast them in fire !
you UNknown UNknown !
you 'r e the one i 'm going to roast in the fires you rotten UNknown !
stop firing !
take cover behind the rocks
no one will open fire
any doubts ?
sir our UNknown has reached
move as soon as the clouds cover the moon
lie still when the moon shows up
the enemy mustn 't get to know about our movement
fire an UNknown round
here comes the UNknown !
there could be mines ahead sir !
move on in the name of the goddess kali
praise to goddess kali !
here comes the UNknown !
come on UNknown !
hail goddess kali !
alfa to UNknown 's care over
UNknown 's care to alfa over
first victory of operation vijay
you don 't seem to be happy
but for me it UNknown l always be a day when i lost my men
today i lost nine of my UNknown brothers
and right now i 'm sending their corpses to their families
i hope you will understand what i 'm going through sir
i was responsible for those soldiers
UNknown when a soldier goes to war he leaves his sentiments behind
UNknown hind sir
our primary aim is to capture point UNknown
that will cut off all the roads to UNknown valley through which the UNknown UNknown receive help
our final objective point UNknown
this point is as important as tiger hill
that 's the point from where we can keep an eye on the entire UNknown sector
besides to protect our national highway it is imperative that we hold this point
charlie company will remain in reserve
major deepak UNknown you three UNknown seven UNknown and captain UNknown UNknown and the two of you
you will survey the heights between UNknown to UNknown
deepak you always said that our job is to hunt and destroy the enemy
to seek and destroy
brigadier UNknown has given us the go ahead
UNknown you wanted to know the enemy right ?
go on introduce yourself
good luck boys
you will be surrounded by UNknown all your life
my sister in law is your to be wife 's best friend
and my brother is your UNknown
what will you do now ?
who knows sir whether the UNknown will be known as UNknown or vice versa ?
but the best part is when friends turn relatives it makes the journey of life even more beautiful
you 'r e dead right
too wise for your age
but UNknown be careful
sir for the sake of her love i 'm willing to do that too
how many men ?

boys before coming to UNknown the c o told us that our platoon 's slogan is victory or UNknown !
the time has come to crush the enemy
the time has come to avenge our dead comrades to avenge our wounded UNknown in the hills

who wants to talk to his folks over the satellite phone ?
lf i fail to return you will give my daughter 's hand away in marriage sir

it 's the same thing sir
all i regret is that i couldn 't talk to my wife and children

lf want to know just ask joe
lf you have a question ask UNknown
you are embarrassing me sir
no joe no UNknown sir

and to protect it it is imperative to kick the enemy out of UNknown 18 grenadiers have made four attempts
unfortunately they have failed
they had no idea about the enemy 's strength
they had no time for rehearsals either sir
but your battalion has had enough time for UNknown sir and has received artillery support too
i understand you colonel
UNknown rifles will capture UNknown
and do you know why colonel
because defeat and failure are words that are not in raj UNknown 's history
they 'r e unknown
but in case you fail in your UNknown 13 UNknown rifles will have to do the job
i 'm not saying it sir
these are the orders from headquarter
don 't worry colonel
i 'm sure
lives will be lost
because every son of our army who gives up his life takes with him some moments of my life
you are a sentimental man colonel
that 's me sir
why not do or die ?
why talk about dying sir ?
looks like your conversation with ms UNknown over the phone wasn 't a pleasant one
yes i had called her up
she hung up the moment she heard me
by now her trash bin must be full of letters

but she can 't feed my father
she 's not willing to quit the army

she was knitting a sweater
she UNknown at me once and that 's it
that 's it
and soon we will have a baby
but you haven 't told me something
i like you
the troops at present are held up at this position
the enemy is somewhere here
our army approached from here and we have lost them
lots of casualties are there
that leaves this one approach which is very steep
i think we UNknown l take this approach sir

over and out

my heart and soul the ties of our love stop you for a few moments
when someone is leaving you mustn 't ever stop him like this
a song of love you must sing for me my love
roses shall blossom as long as the UNknown exist
should our eden be set on fire where would you and i go ?

but you attacked them didn 't you ?
god bless our UNknown UNknown UNknown who suggested the idea
our soldiers tied green bands on their heads and climbed the mountain with the chant allah ho akbar
the UNknown thought they were being joined by more reinforcements
they extended a hand to pull them up only to bite the bullet !
that 's not all sir
when we ran out of green cloth our soldiers tore it out of the national UNknown and tied it around their head sir that 's wonderful
the UNknown refuse to understand that there are more UNknown here in lndia than in pakistan and that they are lndians first and UNknown later !

the guy with the glasses he 's this UNknown dr UNknown and he goes all over
he goes all around the world sort of like on the trail of evil
and yeah you know and then he just he posts this stuff online
eddie it 's all staged

it 's real
because i looked him up online
the guy he was a professor at san francisco state and he just left the university to like live his research
his research ?
UNknown UNknown ?
what have you been reading ?
dad you are a white liberal male living in a hostile world
the white male part is what makes you feel responsible makes you feel guilty
freshman psychology ?
that 's good
whose glasses ?
she 's coming
you 'r e still feeling kind of UNknown ?
there 's nothing like fresh sheets
you don 't look like a nurse
like i don 't belong here
like i 'm not a nurse
like i 'm not devoted to the welfare of those committed to my care
that 's from the florence nightingale pledge that i learned in nursing school
nursing is all that i ever wanted to do
and since i UNknown e been at mt
UNknown i UNknown e had three patients ask me to pose for internet porn sites
that 's too bad
i mean if you wear a uniform and deal with UNknown and UNknown i think men feel like they have to flirt to UNknown for being so exposed
most people have never even heard of this
it 's called UNknown illness
that 's a hell of a middle school
actually ned 's in high school now
you go in with one problem come out with another ?
yeah that 's if you come out
that is more than all the casualties from all the wars fought
in the history of the united states
it is true
but the lawyers are making the real killing
yeah you got that right
what are they giving ?
i 'm just so not here
i 'm so out of it
there 's been a mistake george
you 'r e the
i 'm gonna get dr UNknown to come and explain the details of your surgery
i 'm not a UNknown surgeon
i UNknown l see you shortly
paying folks 200 bucks to come in
and have an unnecessary surgery
i saw this
the surgery UNknown bill the insurance companies 10 20 grand to cut on UNknown
UNknown UNknown mexicans UNknown
unnecessary nose jobs UNknown bullshit UNknown
but for 200 bucks ?
it 's a cure for sweaty palms
they gave me one of those unnecessary UNknown didn 't they ?
the chain of events that led to all of this
i 'm so sorry
the human errors the UNknown it 's the system
the whole system the whole fucking hospital not just ben
ben fucking UNknown

the shit you don 't know is just the shit you don 't want to look at
but it 's all there right there floating
little UNknown of truth

hi UNknown with a y
i need to ask you
when i was little like 5 we went to the bakery on sunday morning to get like UNknown or something and it was raining remember ?
you remember ?
and you said yes
and you just said yes
and i said yes what ?
why did you say that ?
and you said that one day you 'd tell me
why now ?
i don 't wanna have to wonder about it anymore
you can tell me in front of her
you can say anything in front of her
you were 5
and i knew that one day you would come to me and you would ask me for something something that you needed and that only i could give you
and that morning i decided to give you the answer so that when the day did come i could remind you of that moment
and you would know then i UNknown e been waiting my whole life to give you whatever you need
no i really don 't think that 's a good idea
he doesn 't know
then he left
p j came up to talk to you you didn 't even notice him
i don 't know
why is that ?
i 'm not supposed to be here
i 'm so sorry
it 's not your fault
i was supposed to take care of you and i hurt you
i don 't know how to fix that
you could have gotten me in trouble
but you didn 't
but i need to know
what are you gonna do ?
let but you are here
let go of me
yeah all good
of course it is
you think i worry too much ?
good night son
i 'm in room 721 mt
as you can see his eyes are still open and this is how he sees himself now
it 's different from how he saw himself before
and did he ever imagine that it would come to this ?
this is something i must investigate
start running UNknown
i 'm sorry
to be set free ?
for a dose of reality ?
first the lesson
i told you my name bitch
you forget that ?
come on you UNknown motherfucker say it while you still got a pair
no i mean in a UNknown sense motherfucker
do you know what i am ?
i 'm the weight on your chest
i am the fear behind your left UNknown
i am the dark un fucking known
i am the king of egypt
grandpappy of all the sand UNknown
the lord of they them and all them that be other
i am the army of islam
i 'm the UNknown cell yard ape who 's been fucking with your UNknown
the jungle bunny who 's been guarding your drip
the spade digging your grave
the spook who goes bump in your night
i am the uppity field nigger dancing in your end zone and UNknown your iv
i am little black UNknown
i am lincoln 's mistake
i just been fucking with you my little bleached brother
but now you 'r e gonna face your fear
you won 't be afraid no more
i 'm gonna set you free
i 'm doing you a favor
a solid george
that you ain 't just another white liberal male guilt ridden motherfucker worrying about shit he don 't understand ?
the dark unknown 's gonna cut you up
and when i 'm done with you you ain 't gonna be a pussy no more
you learn to fear
and you never grow up
you 'r e still just a kid looking to those who wear the threads of authority
the righteous rags of power
the white coats
the daddy figure you gave jurisdiction over your freedom
a frame of fucking mind
close your eyes george
the UNknown brazen arrogant UNknown notion that you white UNknown saxon protestant alpha male masters of the universe think you know how the other half lives
how do i know what ?
you UNknown e made her happy
that 's a crock of shit
of course you can
suffered with you through the dot com crash
now the kids are almost adults
she 's facing the fact she UNknown l never hold her child in her arms again
not ever again
or spending some 30 odd years relying on you to pay the bills and figuring out what she 's gonna do with her time or where she 's gonna worry
and you think that you can look into her eyes ?
brother you don 't have a clue
what were you thinking about ?
i wasn 't here
it 's virtually unheard of
what is it exactly ?
a UNknown air UNknown it 's the introduction of air into the UNknown system as a result
as a consequence of trauma or UNknown complications
this can cause right UNknown UNknown cardiac arrest and severe UNknown damage such as the coma that you find that your brother is in
it means an illness or complication
that 's been brought on by UNknown he knows what it means
ten months ago he UNknown george 's UNknown with an UNknown the son of a bitch
i 'm sorry
i told you since this happened you are not to talk to me
they be talking truth out there boy
can you hear them ?
well don 't pay them no mind
because we know the real deal in here
ain 't that right ?
now let 's see
dr UNknown could you give us a moment alone ?
i 'm also a board certified UNknown
then explain this to me carefully please
and this little piggy
a UNknown state such as this is the result of severe brain damage
it is a UNknown from coma to a state of UNknown without UNknown UNknown
eyes may be open
but these UNknown are not UNknown to any psychological or physical UNknown
there is no evidence of higher brain function
george is in fact being kept alive only by medical intervention
now a UNknown or persistent UNknown state is declared when a patient fails to emerge from a UNknown state within 30 days
the fact is it has been seven months since he emerged from an 84 day coma into a non responsive sleep wake cycle
the chances that a 40 year old persistent UNknown state patient will recover consciousness are slim to none
what are our options ?
all the way home
and i wouldn 't be counting on no hand jobs in the near future either
hold the phone
what do you say we just leave the mess till tomorrow ?
there 's always tomorrow
ain 't nothing gonna hold you back
so what you gonna do ?
anything you have to say you can say in front of the family
your husband 's admission papers indicated that he had executed a living will
without UNknown the specific provisions of the will itself
remove his feeding tube
i beg your pardon ?
his insurance is still good right ?
no that 's not what we 'r e about
it isn 't ?
you won 't make money off my brother 's insurance by giving him a bed a UNknown for the next two three four five years ?
we are health care professionals
who just happened to fuck him up
if you 'r e insinuating insinuating !
go fuck yourself
mrs grieves if you do have power of attorney as a medical professional it is my opinion that you should authorize us to discontinue artificial life support
there 's a person in here
my husband is in here
and i can tell just by looking into his eyes
that he 's happy
for the rest of my life if that 's what it takes
if you fall in a dream
and you hit bottom
you know i mean hit bottom in the dream and then they really die
but you didn 't
when you 'r e at the bottom toni once told me at the foot of the wall and you look up you ask yourself
how can anyone climb that ?
why would anyone even want to ?
but hours later when you 'r e at the top
looking down you UNknown e forgotten everything
except the one person you promised you would come back to
the north face
the wall of death this perilous alpine face is often called
but german flying ace ernst UNknown UNknown comes within 20 metres of its icy cliffs in search of the missing munich UNknown
max UNknown and karl UNknown
after UNknown into the middle of the face our brave troopers died in their UNknown
after the tragedy the UNknown of UNknown decreed that climbing the north face is strictly forbidden
but will this piece of paper hold back german youth ?
with the olympic games approaching our proud youth senses not only the peril but also the lure this challenge of their skills
for one thing is certain
the first men to summit will be celebrated as olympic heroes
and so the battle cry echoes through europe
attack the UNknown north face !
we must conquer the last problem of the alps !
UNknown may 1936 UNknown at the UNknown UNknown
we UNknown e contacted every alpine club
die hard UNknown die easier than you think
humans are foolhardy by nature
do you know what this is ?
not yet boss
that 's your jurisdiction
henry what about that pair from UNknown ?
it was in the local paper
try to remember
UNknown UNknown and toni UNknown
mr UNknown meant them
it 's all they ever thought about as kids
put one and one together
what have they dreamed about since they were kids ?
graduating from high school UNknown ?
climbing it first olympic gold etc
how do you know about them ?
we practically grew up together
i know almost everything about them
oh really ?
it was a hard life renewing battle for only one who has felt death so near will truly know that life is dear
that too ?
UNknown UNknown UNknown UNknown
a very difficult climb
well done !
i don 't know
miss UNknown come here
then go to the UNknown and have them give you a UNknown
and then off you go to UNknown
tell your old friends that the german reich especially our editor in chief is counting on them
go on !
more german and heroic than either of us
UNknown UNknown UNknown UNknown
or do you still think UNknown mountains excuses you from looking at your watches ?
company sergeant sir we don 't own watches
in that case UNknown i UNknown l tell you how long it is until quitting time
exactly four UNknown in the staff building two company UNknown in barrack v and one floor in the officer 's casino
carry on !
good job !
let 's UNknown from below
c 'm on never say never
everything ok ?
but it was a good idea
maybe it still needs a little work
you need to work on hammering in UNknown
berg heil partner we made it
UNknown and UNknown are going for it
they 'r e climbing the UNknown
i know you you want to do the UNknown too
or why did we scale the south face of the UNknown ?
in the newspaper you yourself wrote
i know what i wrote
scared huh ?
hi mrs UNknown i 'm bringing your toni back home
glad you got back safely
we UNknown e got a visitor
that 's ok
volunteer mrs UNknown
for now in the beginning i mostly make coffee
for the editors
maybe you UNknown l come tonight after all ?
now that UNknown is coming too
where am i coming too ?
i 'm back
and you ?
a while ago
it was great !
you 'r e the talk of berlin
we are ?
with the olympics coming up they 'r e pushing the UNknown
they want stories about the first UNknown
they gave me the story
don 't you wish you could too ?
i go wherever the fuhrer needs me
who knows why they chose me ?
but imagine if you did it !
you 'd be on the front page
UNknown heroes conquer last problem of the alps !
famous all over germany
except for myself
no way i know you
if you know so much you must have heard of
max UNknown and karl UNknown
we knew both of them two first class UNknown
on the death wall there 's sunshine one minute and a blizzard the next
or you get hit by an avalanche or a rock slide
that 's not climbing
that 's why we 'r e skipping it
i 'm tired
UNknown good luck see you around
what was that ?
it 's just like when we went climbing as kids
and if they print my story
you must understand that
you 'r e so stubborn
but i always waited for you in the end
faster you can go much faster !
leave me alone
how long are you going to be too coward to even try ?
you and i could be the first ones up there
that 's not what climbing is about
yes it is that 's exactly what it 's about
i want to prove to the world what i can do and who i am
i don 't have to prove anything to anyone
i climb for myself
on such a tiny
you UNknown e got to be very determined
they backed down right ?
how do you know ?
a reporter 's most important tool
and apparently top notch UNknown
they 'r e camped at the foot of the UNknown
in the next few days
i UNknown l be paying the gentlemen a visit
are you completely mad UNknown ?
i 'm not stupid
i know what the truth is
you 'r e just what i needed UNknown
well then who is getting married ?
i am company sergeant sir
get out !
because what i said wasn 't true
i don 't just climb for me
and someone has to watch out for you
that 's enough now we need 10 ice UNknown
UNknown ice axes UNknown short and long pick two times 30 metres of rope two static chords
there 's no h in UNknown
who cares ?
how much ?
what train ?
sure by bike to switzerland
that 's just 700 km right ?
miss UNknown ?
what about him ?
are you excited too ?
3 970 metres all rock and ice
love at first sight right ?
i 'm not so sure
the train goes straight through the mountain all the way up to the UNknown
3 457 metres
isn 't it splendid ?
the middle station
four stars at over 2 000 metres !
i can see mountains on the riviera
from the seaside
what a circus
the seaside !
i 'm too old to be UNknown maidens
UNknown tours !
who are they ?
quite a place hm ?
you know what the best part is ?
it all counts as travel expenses
your wife will be delighted
too bad we 'r e just colleagues
pretty busy up here
i UNknown l start a fire and cook dinner
you finish pitching the tent
are we married or something ?
don 't talk pet !
i am your mother
bound together in life and death the climbing partners dream of ice and rock
do you see ?
the german soldier dreams of when having fought to the summit the world shall lie at his feet and above him shall stretch the limitless sky
that 's a mouthful
in any case with great photos no one reads the words anyway
did you see the french team 's iron ?
they won 't get as far as the UNknown UNknown
the UNknown don 't even have ice axes
look who 's coming
after all this is a gathering of professionals
were you on the wall today ?
scouting around ?
what 's for dinner ?
i wonder for example
a greater germany
i wouldn 't know if that also applies to you
i was talking about UNknown
now they are a breed of their own hm ?
aren 't you homesick for austria ?
UNknown can 't hold out much longer
when germany UNknown austria we UNknown l be home in the wink of an eye
and then we call the shots
it UNknown l be our turn then
did you see our iron ?
steel UNknown rope only the best and all paid for by the sa
what do you have to do in return ?
be the first ones at the top
wednesday july 15
and it took 15 years to build
from here UNknown rock was dumped straight into the abyss
we are now just shy of 3 000 metres above sea level
UNknown and UNknown started here and climbed straight upward
tedious it 's so steep you 'd need a UNknown every UNknown
i think we should climb UNknown
head for the gallery window
and stash gear there ?
UNknown UNknown 2 UNknown m
careful ladies and gentlemen !
nearly 1 000 metres madam
thanks i believe it already
that anyone would voluntarily go out there !
you UNknown e got to really want it
then across the crack to the UNknown UNknown
first ice field second ice field the UNknown the ramp the spider then a good exit crack to the summit ice field and hallelujah !
did you hear that ?
what are you doing ?
i knew it
when you want something you forget everything else
still here ?
every day and every night
miss UNknown come
don 't you think so ?
it is sinister
what 's the guy 's name ?
the mountain is named after it
thursday july 16
we UNknown l hammer a UNknown stash our gear and be back down for lunch
that will change
our entry point
berg heil UNknown
it 's too risky for them
and the weather doesn 't look rosy either
meaning what ?
thought you didn 't care about the UNknown
who 's your partner ?
who do you think ?
can i buy you a drink ?
i suppose i could shave
the iron UNknown for the ice fields
we use a depot to save energy
you UNknown l do a reconnaissance climb ?
but that 's nowhere near the UNknown route
we 'r e taking our own route
i don 't understand a thing
but i find it terribly adventurous
alright then here 's to adventure ladies and gentlemen
as long as a big pile of UNknown is all the german heroes are out to attack and conquer i don 't mind
pride mr UNknown pride is what this is about
the pride of facing a challenge whether it be in sports or politics
to this i raise my glass
hear hear !
that you all return safely
that 's the important thing
that 's what you wanted to say mr UNknown isn 't it ?
yes let 's drink to that
it 's great fodder for our story
fodder is for animals
isn 't it UNknown lonely so high up ?
can you imagine it ?
for example catching a trout with your bare hand
it 's not easy
or ropes ?
how to find the best hand and UNknown
i never wore skirts
did you teach yourself ?
my piano teacher boxed my ears so i quit and just played in bars after that
thanks for the invite
it 's just starting to get fun
it 's late
disciplined no loafing about am i right ?
we each make our own decisions in life
yes that 's true
one has to take risks
then life 's a game
i say let 's be reckless
rather than UNknown what good is that ?
all these UNknown things
we want to be gay to laugh act silly and daft
and it all works out in the end
take the bull by the horns don 't hesitate
for if you falter you rust
faster faster onward don 't wait
into the wild blue yonder or bust
UNknown july 17
you know what 's sad ?
we UNknown l always be deprived of the real dramas
what do you mean ?
we and the readers
and perhaps on a successful UNknown afterwards
but what really takes place out there is something we can only guess at
i wish it were already over
i wish it would finally get underway
i wanted to tell you last night that i was a little tipsy
i 'd appreciate you looking after this
but you always take it with you
you could but
it would be a shame if it got lost
see you in a bit !
wake up !
you UNknown l wake up the competition
saturday july 18 2 10 a m
we 'r e off to a good start hm ?
what is it ?
we UNknown l pass those eager UNknown before they hit the first ice field
if the storm didn 't take it
could have been worse huh ?
the lull is over the last problem of the alps is under attack
hands off !
quit knocking rocks down on us !
if you 'r e climbing in our fall line keep your distance !
the UNknown route is more to the left
UNknown and UNknown started here climbed to here
here 's the window to the cog railway
they cross over here and enter the first ice field and hit the UNknown UNknown route climb up over the second ice field
what do you say to this beautiful weather ?
i doubt it will hold
the french and italian teams didn 't set out
it 's like at a gladiator fight !
we aren 't legally required to
ah there they are !
our hardy mountain brigade
you make sure we have enough shots of the spectators
where is your camera ?
look show me i didn 't make a mistake with you !
step aside !
1 15 p m UNknown UNknown 2 UNknown m
yeah if you can even find a place to sink them
this is a lousy route
you could take a different one
no one is forcing you to stick to us like glue
we UNknown l UNknown this slab climb up the chimney and cross over the ice field
you can 't cross here !
you always say never say never
have fun gentlemen
though i doubt you UNknown l make it
we UNknown l UNknown to a lower point and cross there
i saw a good spot
mind if we cross ?
what 's this ?
i thought they were the competition
the whole rope ?
not on your life
so things wouldn 't get boring
in case we have to come back
now you 'r e being overly cautious
up there that 's the way to berlin
3 30 p m flrst ice UNknown 2 980 m
it stinks without UNknown
yeah that does help
have they given up already ?
8 30 p m
let 's find a nice b b ?
flrst UNknown 3 100 m
we 'r e more than halfway
we might make it by tomorrow
ladies and gentlemen the house presents this cake to celebrate the first UNknown of the UNknown north face

tomorrow the UNknown will be conquered today you can consume a piece of it
bon UNknown !
you 'r e lucky madam

it 's no use
there 's nothing down there
11 15 a m second ice UNknown 3 150 m
that one is UNknown right ?
have a look
and at this pace they won 't make it tomorrow either
that means UNknown twice more ?
so no summit push today
c 'm on let 's have a drink
what 's wrong ?
your UNknown from munich ?
he 's not faking it that 's for sure
can you see anything ?
more or less
but one is in bad shape
c 'm on wake up !
3 40 p m flat iron 3 350 m

i UNknown l manage
i can do it
i UNknown l manage
and we go on
alright then we UNknown l do it together
we UNknown l go up together
we UNknown l pull him up with us

why did i listen to you ?
we should just leave you behind
it would serve you right willy
our only chance is over the summit
forget the summit !
we UNknown l cross over the west ridge and get help
we don 't know what awaits us up there and by the time we get down
he UNknown l be dead
i promise you that

second UNknown 3 250 m
then pull him out of the meeting !
tell him the tables are turning
yes of course i UNknown l wait
is something wrong ?
those two don 't care about the politics anyway
it would have been hard to fashion them into german heroes
are we leaving too ?
yes it looks like it
shouldn 't we stay and report on what happens up there ?
i don 't want to UNknown you child but you either need a glorious triumph or a horrible tragedy
an UNknown retreat is nothing more than a few lines on page 3
there 's no need to stay for that
monday july 20
we 'r e in for a UNknown

i 'm certain
it might be worth it to stay

he pulled out the rope

i 'm here
wednesday july 22 8 00 am
do you have the 60 m rope ?
good he can pull it up with a cord
do you really think he
it would take hours to get up to him so he has to UNknown to us
but even if he 's dead we have to get him
we 'r e here !
you could use a guardian angel like that hm ?
look where she 's sitting
she has to get down or she UNknown l fall !
if she was there all night she won 't fall now
c 'm on !
do you have anything for pulling up a rope ?

did they find the others ?
listen what i said
it 's a terrible tragedy
but germany will never forget these men
i UNknown l take you back to berlin
i 'm not going back to berlin
i 'm not going back
there are too many people like you there
all i know is that death spared me and that toni went away forever that day
one has lived if one has loved
there are times when i find this infinitely hard to believe
most days i feel that i am alive
and that love is the reason for that
the first UNknown of the UNknown north face took place in 1938
the german austrian climbing party followed toni UNknown and UNknown UNknown 's route
the nazis declared it an athletic symbol of the recent UNknown of austria into the german reich
the last great problem of the alps had been conquered
no way UNknown ifl care or not UNknown i ng

UNknown was low and my eyes stayed down
UNknown was slow

i 'm too young to be trapped by the wire
that 's within
nothing 's left unseen on the UNknown
sam 's voice
UNknown was the most beautiful UNknown in the world
UNknown was discovered by a prince UNknown and the prince was led into a world UNknown and beautiful magic
nobody could see how beautiful she was because she was invisible invisible to everyone UNknown
UNknown UNknown we 'i i explode

there was this glowing grid cutting through my brain and
you know i knew when it got all the way through that i 'd just be like this UNknown out vegetable
the whole time my UNknown was twisting and turning in my throat
i can slip back into it now and again
but that 's like a gift and a curse
cause that means you gotta figure out what 's real and what 's not
it 's like you have to decide
maybe this is all a nightmare and we UNknown l just wake up
i 'd do anything to take it all back just start over
that 's about as real as it gets
there 's gotta be some connection between what happened to sam and donnie
that was sam 's brother ?
she didn 't mention him to me
why UNknown ?
i thought that she
what about her parents ?
UNknown UNknown she wasn 't enough UNknown to love
she told me she thought her brother was the lucky one

i UNknown j UNknown
sam hollow voice
donnie liked to draw
you work here ?
i understand that you don 't want to talk about it but i believe that everything happens for a reason and and i know that for every action
there is an equal and opposite reaction
i went to high school
then you know that everything is in constant motion
like right now the universe is UNknown
and we 'r e flying through space at millions of miles per hour like a spaceship
and eventually it 's just gonna grow so big that it UNknown l freeze and die and then nothing we do will matter at all
so corey doesn 't matter ?
potential or or or destiny
like i was destined to get my hands on that UNknown
and it turns out that that it 's not even a UNknown at all
it has this this metal in it that doesn 't even exist on the UNknown table
i think i think i 'm gonna call it UNknown
UNknown last name ?
i can see things that i only used to dream about

my UNknown sound
a UNknown telling me that i was good
you know it was like that was huge
go back to your center
you know go to your center

we are going all the way back to UNknown for this number one smash
with you can 't hurry love here is brandon rogers
i need love love to ease my mind
i feel my strength it 's almost gone i remember mama said you can 't hurry love
love don 't come easy ? how long must i wait how much more can i take before loneliness will cause my heart to break
the big twelve night
UNknown you came out like you had UNknown back to a background singer for me
you forgot the words
UNknown it has to be better than that for me man
it is not 's y to do what you are doing
especially the first night out here
nerves play a big part of it
going from a small round into a big concert hall like this
you know brandon we don 't need to tell you what you did wrong
there are many things that you do right
and i think that cheers and applause ? that was a complete
let down actually brandon
no star quality in that performance
all right well let 's talk about it for a second
does it affect you ?
the whole crowd cheering and everything
cheers and applause
and i enjoyed it a little too much
nerves coming into play how about going first tonight ?
how did that affect you ? well i knew i had to bring it
apparently i didn 't do my best
i will try to do better next time if i 'm given the opportunity all right
it is up to america for ?
give it up for brandon one more time
good luck man
don 't go anywhere
but this season you can ask your favorite questions as well
go to UNknown com
ask a question to an idol
UNknown is with me right now
how are you ? good
so let 's see
what do you consider the hardest part of this contest ? wow
i would have to say the high heels and these dresses
i like my tennis shoes and my sweat pants
i 'm sorry
stay out out of my closet
good luck baby thank you
i am an old school UNknown girl at heart
so people like diana ross are just huge to me i 'm such a big fan UNknown heard so much about you
you sound good
when she started to sing the words you believed it
i think the audience will feel
that i did
i feel that will you believe in her too ?
with home here she is
i got to say i don 't know if it was my favorite performance of yours
but it was still really strong
so for that performance i give the girls one the boys zero
that was hot baby
you are feeling so much joy
it is exciting
look at you
this is it for you
you are so into this
cheers and applause simon ?
are you at a loss for words ?
what 's happening ? i 'm sneezing
i 'm sorry
me linda i mean you have even made
i have always thought that song was ?
you are making me laugh paula
you made a very boring song fantastic
you know who you remind me of ?
you remind me of a young gladys knight
right ? yes if you want to vote for UNknown
UNknown UNknown 02
good to see you tonight
i feel we have very similar hair
it is exciting yes we do i can 't get mine to go as much out like that you have to tease i UNknown l see what i can do
that will be great
and give it a different feel
see how you like it okay
i 'm sure i will
i changed some of the UNknown around can i give you one comment ? yes please the music is about going to the heart
with endless love it is important to find the melody and hold on to it
chris needs to listen more to the melody of the song and find that hook
that is the thing that will sell this song
and it will sell him
well they shared hair
with endless love here is chris UNknown
chris what 's up baby ?
so this is the new top twelve chris
because like the melody changed everywhere
but you have to not worry about the style and sing your heart out
you have a good voice
but that was a mess for me
well that song is so UNknown and it is such a beautiful love song
and sometimes i worry that you are trying UNknown hard to be UNknown hip and cool
and sometimes you can just let the melody play
listen to the lyrics
i would worry less about fitting into some kind of contemporary thing
chris i think you murdered the arrangement personally
i really do
i thought it was just the booth ? UNknown UNknown
and i would keep your glasses on
i think it is you chris UNknown
UNknown from the judges
little boy huh ? no
i have a lot of respect for diana ross
i went with my gut
you know i felt like it was a good arrangement
but obviously you know the judges and i have different opinions ?
it had a lot more to do with the arrangement of the song than it did the vocal
but i mean obviously that is part of the whole thing
so hopefully next week ly come back and try to do something that is arranged a
little better if america ? for chris UNknown UNknown 03
chris UNknown ladies and gentlemen ?
when we come back we have gina live back with the idol
we are live and celebrating the music of diana ross
one person leaves us live tomorrow
remember it is your call that counts
next up is a star struck gina
here we go hello ms
she is a legend
i have a story about this song
when i was like four years old my parents have a UNknown of me singing
they were like you know what this song is about ? gina to me has incredible vocal ability
the things i wanted to remind her of was UNknown
there are so many words
you must UNknown everything okay she told me the song was a story
don 't leave any words out
don 't die out on the phrases
? you know what i mean ?
you have to UNknown
ross 's advice and run with it i wish you well
i do thank you so much ?
another number one for diana with the UNknown back in UNknown
here is gina singing love child
you think that i don 't feel
love what i feel for you is real love in other 's eyes i see reflected a hurt scorned rejected
love child never meant to be
love child born in poverty
love child never meant to be
love child take a look at me
love child different than the rest
love child never quite as good afraid ashamed misunderstood but i UNknown l always love you
i UNknown l always love you
i UNknown l always love you
i UNknown l always love you
love child thank you !
cheers and applause
i wasn 't my favorite performance from you
i 'm a gina fan
it was UNknown in spots
i didn 't feel the excitement from you with that song
it felt very boring to me
you know what i mean ?
i don 't know
i mean that song is like a feel good you can 't help yourself you want to get up
i feel that you are much better than how you did tonight
i feel like at times you were shouting and UNknown and pitch were kind of off okay gee marks the it was okay
you actually can 't say much about really
it wasn 't terrible
it is good that you stayed in this image again
that suits you
that 's why i 'm saying there is not much to say about it really
it was a middle pack performance okay gina UNknown
the first time i 'm on a huge stage
all these people
UNknown UNknown 04
after the break live
what will the top twelve deliver tonight ?
next up it is UNknown UNknown to me is love
you care about him
like having van gogh teach you how to paint
ain 't no mountain high he started this song right off the bat without any bars to set it up stop
if you are going to do it like that you will have to be really point on
i didn 't feel that he was on the beat ?
at the beginning you were just do you tap your feet or anything is i just need to move around and like have fun
just feel it in my body you better get your soul in there
can you dance ?
and it is not his hair
number one as a solo artist
can UNknown own it tonight ? ?
what is really going down UNknown ? yeah
i 'm like dude it wasn 't very good
it really wasn 't man
it wasn 't
because that song was almost UNknown for me man
it was really really weak
you know what i love about you ?
every week you throwing down some different UNknown with the hair
the hair is rockin though
hair idol off got it
you know what i mean ? ?
i understand what diana said
you are the sweetest soul
you have to start it off you have to grab the audience
and when a song like that happens you have to let go
that is the thing you have to explode with your UNknown now
you have to jump out reckless abandon
she is going to freak when she hears that
the only similarity is the UNknown
i don 't know what else to say
i mean it was crowd boo i will be positive
how old are you ? 17 you are very brave
i UNknown l give you that you are brave
the courage of UNknown UNknown
i think we are dying to know what 's going on in your head when you are listening to them give you UNknown tonight i don 't know
i mean i listen to the positive things
no offense simon
what i was trying to say was when she listens to this on tv she will scream he wasn 't talking about the marine biology aspect of
more of an audible sound from okay
thank you very much
live on idol
we are all about diana ross tonight
tomorrow she is performing
tune in for that
where is the craziest blaze you ever sang ? you know it has to be here
this night is so intense
like we are back stage and we are freaking out
it is so intense
nothing will ever compare to this it is pretty intense
the waiting room back there is anybody speaking ? yeah
we are speaking
we are like cold and drinking water ?
we are nervous water
take a look at your master class ? how are you ? i 'm good ? you really are good i 'm sing missing you
i thought it would show more emotion
ooh i 'm missing you she has a recording studio voice as compared to a live audience projection
her voice was too much inside
we were missing him
i think the audience reads that and feels that my goal tonight is definitely to enjoy the song and sing every word and truly mean the words
because the lyrics were beautiful
and to have fun and not stress out about the little things
kind of have fun out there
let 's hope it is fun for you too
with missing you here is haley UNknown
i 'm missing you tell me why tell me why the road turns
cheers and applause
you already know what i 'm going to say
you know forgetting the words and stuff i think you UNknown a little nervous when you started
you know it was all UNknown and all over the place
usually your pitch is better than
that just a little surprised
a little shocked well i UNknown l start with saying you look lovely tonight
cheers and applause but you know that is probably not what you want to hear so far
again the same thing ? forgetting the words is never a great thing to do
and your pitch you are so adorable
you know this is hard
this is a hard thing
what can i say ? i didn 't think it was that bad
i think you had real presence up there
your nerves got the best of you halfway through the song
but if you can just hold it together you may do better than i thought you were going to do
because i think
there were moments of your UNknown i liked it
let it out ?
a little relieved i feel like i 'm going like this if you would like a stool there is one right there
that is good
that is good news
i feel like such a UNknown
you know it is what it is
but simon and everybody it means so much to get a good
something good from you guys
i feel like this is like the worst performance just because
i messed up my words
it truly means so much to me half the time the audience never knows you have messed up
never let them see anything
good luck thank you ? we will disappear for a few moments
we UNknown l be back with phil stacey
halfway through the most emotional show to date
wouldn 't you agree ? absolutely
i do agree tears excitement good performances ?
i would ask you more but we have to keep moving ?
good to have you with us
this is my nana
now it is time for phil stacey
take it away phil i 'm phil stacey
how are you doing ? i 'm fine such an honor to meet you today
when i met diana ross i didn 't have much of a game plan
i wanted to get the song right ?
i like the song he selected
it is a song i did with marvin UNknown
he brought back memories for me
one of the things i have had an issue with is gathering myself and getting in the right mind set before i go out on stage
i asked for her advice you know what i think helped me is looking at the audience
they are real people
ross you are welcome this week i 'm going to start a lot differently
and a lot more confident he is confident
will he make you love him ?
ladies and gentlemen phil stacey
i 'm gone action do all the things for you a girl wants a man to do oh baby
i UNknown l sacrifice for you
i UNknown l even do wrong for you oh baby ? ? ?
i 'm gonna make you love me oh yes i will yes i will my love is strong you see
i know you UNknown l never get tired of me oh baby every night and every day
i 'm gonna say i 'm gonna get you
look out girl i 'm gonna get you
i 'm gonna make you love me yes i will
yes i will
cheers and applause
you glad that is over ?
how do you think you did UNknown ? i thought it was pretty good
it was the performance the performance was a little boring
you get the boy award for the night man
the UNknown were hot
i love that yeah we were discussing that while you were performing
your UNknown sound really good
that song we were feeling a need to be more up tempo
it would have been more exciting
other than that though phil you have strong UNknown
you do UNknown were hot baby
that shouldn 't be an up tempo song
he chose the right tempo should have more tempo to it whatever
whatever it was okay
you have a tendency though that when you are trying to hit the big notes you shout
so it is like you are shouting in my ear
somehow you have to control that
it wasn 't outstanding
it was better than last week though ? i thought it was really good
it was good take that man
take that and bill
thank you very much phil
good luck to you
hang on back with you live on idol
who will win your vote at the end of the show ?
she wrote it while on tour or when i did the movie lady sings the blues that is how we had the song in the film
because of this song you know what it is billie holliday and all of
that wear something long and simple would you suggest having a UNknown stand or not having a UNknown stand ?
? ? you can bring them to you
it says to me she is thinking about how she should perform it thank you so much
i am looking forward to seeing what UNknown decides to do
call her UNknown
with god bless the child here is UNknown
UNknown is in the house
check it out
i love the outfit
you could have easily done
that you have a big old voice
that was sensational
you are a beautiful girl
and your heart comes through when you sing
that is the most important thing you can possess as an artist
UNknown you have either got it or you haven 't got it
you UNknown e got it
i mean there is the difference
i have to say the quality difference between you and UNknown compared to the other singers we have heard so far you two are in a different league
and why that was
it was a very controlled performance
you didn 't look UNknown by this big stage or the big orchestra
you were very much in control
performed like a star
i know you feel good after that
simon says that you UNknown e got it
do you feel like you are comfortable with it i 'm getting it
i 'm getting it how did you feel inside when you were singing that ? a little nervous
a little bit you didn 't show it sing
i 'm used to singing so loud and so big
i wanted to tone it down a bit good control tonight
congratulations thank you
blake lewis is on after the break
welcome back to american idol live
blake lewis ladies and gentlemen in the house
blake another viewer question
right ? yeah good luck
set me free why don 't ya babe
blake was doing a song that
i did in the 60 's and he was bringing it from the 60 's to today
and you need to make it fresh
so i like seeing what you are going to do with it thank you
that i just UNknown it and i hope she really likes it
this song is so popular
it has been UNknown into the UNknown hall of fame
with you keep me hangin on here is blake
set me free why don 't you babe get out my life why don 't you babe UNknown UNknown you don 't really
all right check it out UNknown
blake you know i 'm a UNknown
i mean you know classic songs like this you don 't necessarily have to change the arrangement
you don 't have to worry about blake UNknown every song
you like that word right ?
check it out
that let the UNknown do your thing
you are a great performer
you are modern hip cool
let the classics be the classics
you know what i mean ? i understand what you are saying totally
i do agree to a certain extent
i do you have to put more UNknown in it
there wasn 't enough of you
you sing better than that you are a real good singer too you are a real good singer too you can work it out i didn 't get that blake
i didn 't get it at all
i understand why you wanted to put your own take on it
that is fair enough
because that song was written in a particular style
it didn 't work changing the melody like that
you didn 't sound as good as we have heard you either the classics don 't need changing most time you don 't need to change anything
we love UNknown sounds you will be fine blake
but blake lewis
i wanted to put my feel to it
you know maybe a little more electronic UNknown to it did you get what they are saying about the UNknown though ?
they are saying to go for it yeah if you want to vote for blake
then you can vote
live results tomorrow night put it in your pocket you realize this is a live UNknown
right ? lots of drama tomorrow
like there is not enough tonight
you ready for stephanie ? yes watch this i 'm going to be singing
you build up a little bit i will take her advice to heart
you know ?
i started off
hopefully she is watching and she is like that 's my girl
she did it
with love hangover here is stephanie
if there 's a cure for this
i don 't want it
i don 't want it if there 's a cure for this i don 't want it i don 't want it think about it all the time
i never let it out of my mind
cause i love you
i don 't want a cure for this
i don 't want a cure
cause you are in my heart in my head and i just can 't get out of the bed baby i don 't wanna get over the sweetest hangover
i don 't wanna i don 't wanna get i don 't wanna get over
cheers and applause
with forgetting a little bit of the words tonight
i don 't think it was your best vocal
a strong finish
i was waiting for the up tempo part to start
i was like come on is there a reason why you didn 't do it ?
we wait for that
kind of too long to put it in that is what arranging is for
you have strong UNknown
strive for better
you teased everybody with the good part
you failed to deliver
it didn 't close particularly well
i think you were completely UNknown by UNknown and UNknown tonight
it wasn 't your best performance
and you had a multitude of amazing diana ross songs to choose
from and you chose in my opinion the wrong song
and you are going to have to make a much bigger impact at this stage of the competition stephanie stephanie edwards
come over here stephanie
you have a lot of control over it
it is just that once it got to the whole UNknown part of the song it was kind of like a
lot of music and just ad UNknown
i wanted to sing the verses and the melody of the song let 's see if you get a shot to do something next week
to arrange another one 10 good luck to you stephanie thank you all right next what advice did diana have for chris ? hello
i 'm chris
i 'm no different than you
i 'm just older
are you going to work the audience ? i hope so ; ? he has to move around a bit on that song
in other words move around to sell the song to the audience
anyway it sounds really good
keep your head in a good place thank you so much
? let 's see if he can work it singing the boss
here is chris richardson
love taught me who was the boss
i defy anyone who says that i ?
so right why should i feel so UNknown so ?
love did show me one thing oh that love taught me who was the boss cheers and applause
i tell you what ? i mean it wasn 't my favorite performance of yours
you overdid it a little bit ?
the words you did connect on were hot
you know you know it was interesting for me
kind of half and half
half good half bad for me
i think out of all the guys you nailed the blend of bringing contemporary into
and it was fun
you turned in that direction
you did a great job
chris remembering this is a singing competition take you out of the UNknown with your charm and personality
listen to the UNknown i thought it was dreadful
it was terrible
good luck chris
welcome back to idol
what was the chemistry like between diana and UNknown ?
this week i 'm going to be showing my softer side by singing if we hold on together
i think UNknown is absolutely gorgeous
but you need to be able to project a song you have to
look at the audience and really believe and own the words of the song
tell them the story
with each passing day
i will apply ms
because of her smile and you see the glitter the shine in her eyes
so she has an inner light
which is very important this song was featured in
the land before time
don 't lose your way with each passing day you UNknown e come so far don 't throw it away
i 'm saying it i 'm impress with you mean a lot of people think this is a two girl race on the girls 's UNknown
tonight with that you just made it a three girl race
cheers and applause
you are like a breath of fresh air
you are beautiful
i wasn 't that familiar with that song
but it doesn 't matter
because you drew me in right away thank you
it was a little bit UNknown
a little bit UNknown
i thought it was a very very good vocal
you are UNknown everybody each and every week
here are all the performances and numbers one more time
take a look
i UNknown l get down the stairs clowns to the left of me jokers to the right here i am stuck in the middle with you ?
i 'm wondering what it is i should do so hard to keep this smile from my face losing control
well i don 't know why i came here tonight i got the feeling that something ain 't right
here they are
that is the question that we are going to answer tonight
i 'm ryan UNknown

phil stacey took on the same UNknown with UNknown UNknown

i think you need to work on coloring up the way you sing
ryan you are silly simon didn 't extend any kindness to UNknown after he UNknown pearl jam
jeremy very indulgent choice of song
i didn 't get that at all

the best vocal of the night chris showed me that a
little extra lovin never hurts you have to give me a hug UNknown

i don 't want to go home for some girls it was about contemporary r b
sweet thing hold me tight and don 't let go paula was feeling it i thought you were darn near flawless
you can sing sing sing when UNknown and haley went sweet
their songs left simon with a sour taste i thought it was horrible

and now we want to give something back

take a look at this
that is what we saw some of the children we will be helping

but with your help we will be able to guarantee a much brighter future
now simon we just took this trip
and i mean we enjoyed it
we learned a lot
what did you take away from it ?
it was something i will never ever forget
i mean seeing some of the most appalling conditions i have ever seen in my life
and then we met some of the nicest people i have ever met
and so you UNknown mixed emotions

thanks to the judges
by bye everybody
the guys threw it down
but four more cuts must be made
your votes are in
let 's see what you have done with it
tonight four more contestants will perform for the final time as we get closer to revealing your top 12
we hate to see them go
we have a great show to help ease the pain
later in the program the american idol challenge
you could be here in this audience with a very nice chunk of change
on this very stage in a few singing live UNknown UNknown
that is pretty cool UNknown
and right now in those three chairs are american idol judges
randy jackson paula abdul and simon UNknown
over 32 million votes came in
let us look at what you are voting for
this week the top ten guys and top ten girls took the stage for a second chance to win your votes
after less than winning reviews last tuesday the guys were quick to step up their game
UNknown went UNknown
and blake beat boxed it is so good to hear you return to form UNknown
i like you man feeling good
feeling good and apparently so was a j
UNknown simon was feeling the same you absolutely i think did the right thing
you came out and you have made yourself different
you made yourself stand out UNknown i took a risk
and it worked unfortunately in the judges eye it didn 't work for everyone
that was really weak when it was brandon 's turn simon was annoyed by something other than his singing
UNknown it is my dad 's birthday by the way it is my mum 's birthday in november
happy birthday mum in six months time
i like puppies UNknown UNknown wanted some love too
paula was ready you are a good looking guy
she is not dressed edgy gina wasn 't the only person mr
fashion police was going to pull over
can i be honest with you ? yes i don 't like the outfit tonight
i found it distracting do take fashion advice from simon leslie went UNknown with nina simone
that bit at end the you sounded like paula talking oh what ?
others were keen to keep it contemporary
UNknown took on christina
it was not good
it was all over the place UNknown can 't win with them UNknown couldn 't win either
but she was ready to fire back i thought you were worse than last week simon was wrong about jennifer hudson
so hopefully let me be clear okay ?
we put jennifer hudson in american idol
the american audience voted her out
okay ? whitney houston was again a popular choice
queen of the night i think you are one of two or three very vulnerable girls tonight
but it was UNknown 's funny valentine that finally got simon to show the love
the best vocal we have had through the competition
and it was a fantastic performance
however it is the love that you give america that really counts
the votes are in

one more time on this stage
in just a moment
we put together a tape for you for nick for UNknown and for a j
watch this i was in a UNknown a month ago
here i am UNknown
so this is the beginning for me i feel so much stronger as a person
this is the best thing that 's happened to me
you made it
girls on wednesday
are you smarter than a fifth UNknown UNknown
i 'm ryan UNknown
who will you send into the top 12 ?
the drama is about to begin
and we don 't have paula right now
we will find her
we are live and ready for eight dazzling performances
as the girls pull out all the stops to win your votes
here they are
UNknown jones gina UNknown and UNknown doolittle
this is it ladies
tomorrow we announce the top 12
plus details on our most important and probably most ground breaking idol project to date
that is live tomorrow
keep it up for the judges
randy jackson paula abdul has made it !
simon UNknown !
she had to get something for me
randy this is a family show
simon last night 's show was live
the girls have chosen some great music tonight
we have mary j ??? some whitney and we start with pat UNknown from UNknown sparks
let 's do it ???
on the weekends nobody ever sees me because i 'm out supporting my team
i put the face paint on and everything
there was actually a time in my life where i wanted to play football
it was up there with singing but not quite
come on u
this is weird man
it is like a different show when the girls come in
that was hot
i mean it wasn 't your best performance
there were a couple of UNknown spots
it was still better than all the boys last night
i 'm like what 's going on !
it is girls time baby
the energy that you brought to this stage today i just think you are getting better and better each week
you were exploding coming into your own UNknown
it is unbelievable i think you will be here for a long long long time
i 'm not quite as enthusiastic about this
i thought it was a bit UNknown in the middle
it is a high song
you have done well
i don 't think it was your strongest performance we have seen out of the last three weeks ok thank you
you can feel that top 12
can 't you ?
very i can hardly contain myself
good luck congratulations on everything
i don 't notice anything
now i do
we UNknown l be right back with sabrina and UNknown live
back with you live on idol
eight girls fighting for six places in the top 12
those results coming to you live tomorrow night
plus an appearance by carrie underwood
she will be with us
gina and sabrina with me right now
so the girls have been getting a lot of praise as a group
is that a blessing or a curse ?
i think it is a blessing
i believe that all of us together we feed off of each other 's energy and talent
for every single one of us it is getting higher and higher
has it made it easier for you ?
we are all nervous tonight
we know what 's at stake
the best thing we can do is sing well and have fun
and you know leave the rest up to god and america
we will give you a shot to do that right now
let 's see what you have been keeping from us ???
when i was in high school i wanted to be the next katie UNknown
monday 's pep rally kicked off a sensational week of spirit
i UNknown our weekly high school television show ???
and i was the anchor i would go around
i had fun interviewing everyone on campus
i 'm really glad i had the singing thing going
because i 'm definitely not the next ryan UNknown ???
look sabrina i don 't know if this was my favorite performance from you
it was a solid performance
i 'm not sure i loved the song choice
you did your thing i mean you pick songs you show your big voice you have that
i wish that song had more melody for me
it was a good solid performance from you
for me there was one thing that is consistent
you can sing sing sing gorgeous
your voice just UNknown
you look beautiful tonight
i think i know where randy is coming from here
because it is lacking the emotion i see from your main competitors which are UNknown UNknown stephanie
for me it was a little bit UNknown
i have to say particularly because of the choice of song it actually reminded me of a hotel resort performance
i 'm not saying you are not a great singer
somehow you have to UNknown personality because without personality you will only go so far with your voice
we have to start believing you a little bit now
it is all too mechanical for me
if you are performing at any hotel i will go there ???
it should be noted he does stay at very fine hotels and UNknown
i played all the way through high school
but since i have been in college i haven 't had the time to practice
so i 'm a little rusty
i still take lessons when i come home for summers
that is really fun
i mean that was a cool song cool song
it was a nice ending you did
but it was a little UNknown in the middle there
i just always feel like the last couple of weeks that you don 't quite believe you are a better singer than you have shown
it is another okay performance for me
i don 't know
and where you stand right now with your range
bottom notes kind of have to watch out for
when you hit into the higher range ???
you picked the right song
the reality is and i think you know this yourself which is you are surrounded by some pretty amazing girl singers
i don 't know how much more you can do to be honest with you
i don 't think your voice is going to get any better
you know i feel for you because you have taken a lot of stuff in the media
you have handled yourself throughout ???
i 'm not going to UNknown you here
it wasn 't your worst
we have heard you sound worse
i have a problem here
when you look at the other girls do you feel like you deserve a place in that final 12 ?
i think i have a different style than them
i 'm not trying to compare myself to anybody else
i wish the judges wouldn 't compare me to anyone else
i try to be myself
do you understand what simon is saying or not ?
i understand that yeah i 'm not going to doubt the talent
i think everyone is an amazing singer here
but i don 't try to be like them
we are all different we are all unique
let 's get real
you know ?
let 's get to a warmer place
let 's shift gears right ?
thank you and good luck
when we come back we have haley and stephanie live
this is the number one show in the country
your votes can change lives
on stage next it is haley
when i was younger i was a UNknown
i started at the age of five
i continued on for ten years
i loved it it was a lot of fun ???
i UNknown my shoulder and then the other shoulder
then my body was through it was time to quit
then i turned to singing
i found out it was my true love and passion here i am
damn these old wheels rollin too slow
i stare down this white line with so far to go headlights keep comin loneliness humming along who poured this rain who made these clouds
but i guess you know that is kind of who you are
that is probably why you chose it right ?
it was okay
the performance was cool pretty much in tune
it had just no pa UNknown UNknown to it
you know what i 'm saying
that is a difficult UNknown to hear
no yo in it
i mean that is the song you sing well
i mean it is not our favorite song
you sang it well
yes thank you
i will tell you the problem ???
i don 't know your name i genuinely don 't
you haven 't made an impression on this competition
i don 't think that performance helped at all
that is horrible
well yeah you can
so you just kind of do what you have to do
clock in and clock out
i 'm UNknown in doing my job
i 'm going to clock out right after i walk off this stage
haley you haven 't always gotten bad comments
not from everybody but simon doesn 't like me
i like you ???
i don 't think it showed you properly as an artist that is all
i think it is tough with the girls
it is anyone 's game up there right now
america you decide
very intense this evening isn 't it ?
thank you thank you
i have been singing since i was three years old
and i was only singing for my parents
whenever my parents asked me to sing at a UNknown or barbecue
i was so shy i would run in the room and cry
i think people will find that pretty weird
now i 'm confident and comfortable on stage
and it is just weird because i used to be really shy
i will love you anyway even if you cannot stay i think you are the one for me here is where you ought to be
i just want to satisfy you you 'r e not mine and i can 't deny it don 't you hear me talkin baby
love me now or i UNknown l go crazy whoa sweet thing don 't you know you 'r e my everything
you 'r e my sweet thing sweet thing
love me now or i UNknown l go crazy
it is always hard for me though when you started the song i 'm hearing shock in my head
i can 't help it
it is not supposed to be compared to that ???
it was okay for me really
there were some UNknown problems in there
i don 't know
i thought you were darn near flawless
i think you have to watch a little bit slightly falling behind in the music
staying on top of the beat
but you have a beautiful voice
and you have great UNknown
and you can manage it on stage
you did a great job thank you so much
stephanie no question you are one of the best we UNknown e got ???
you have a tendency to go a little bit copy cat
we are trying to find your UNknown here
but for me you have 100 done enough to get into the final 12 next week
i hope you are
she definitely does
you don 't have to sing UNknown i know you love it ???
you know what i 'm saying
don 't call until after the show
thank you very much good luck
the girls on a mission to make it into the top 12
we need some UNknown right now
i 'm ready to bring
can i get a hug from you ?
you know it
UNknown is up
any kind of animal
i used to hide behind the doors
whenever i go over somebody 's house i 'm always asking them do you have animals ?
put them away because i will be on the table or couch
share my life take me for what i am cause i UNknown l never change all my colors for you i don 't really need to look very much further
i don 't want to have to go where you don 't follow
i 'm telling you another great performance by the great UNknown
you don 't have to run anywhere
you are going to stay right here
and you are going to work on being the next idol
what we haven 't seen tonight that you brought passion talent UNknown
and of course the yo factor
and just picking up on what i mentioned last week about the outfit UNknown
tonight you look beautiful
they need their own show
oh my god i told them don 't act up
well they are clearly listening to you
right ladies !
we will take a breather
that will be fun
nothing just hanging out
lots of people watching
everything you have always wanted
and more for the past four years
on the line tonight
yes i do rely a lot on luck on this show
this is UNknown
and this is pickle
i don 't travel without it
i love it
i UNknown e made up your mind
i 'm here
you had a couple of things going on ???
this is who i thought you were
coming out ??? i love
that keep the edge alive
come on man
i know it gets exciting with the band and everything
watch by not UNknown
other than that this is the style that suits you best
i really did
you looked comfortable
this was the girl we wanted in this stage of the competition
picking up on what randy and paula said i think you tended to scream the song
but actually i really really hope you make it through next week
because you are honestly you are a breath of fresh air
by choosing better more UNknown songs you could do well
i hope the song wasn 't too extreme for you for the audience
you deserve to be there
you have such a great personality
oh thank you
i think what i needed to hear was simon saying where is the edgy girl
this is me
this is what i 'm comfortable in
i 'm stumbling on my words
i got a comment from simon UNknown
i 'm just me
i rock out with the band great job guys
i don 't know what else to say
thank you very much
your ready for UNknown ?
i do some UNknown things
some of my friends like to call it UNknown
i like to think of it as equal opportunity
you see like if i chew a certain amount on one side i have to do it on the other side
if i step on a crack with one foot i need to do it with the other foot ???
i mean it is all about equality
we are all in this together right ?
i can wash out forty four pairs of socks and have them hangin on the line
i can starch and iron two dozen shirts before you can count from one to nine
i don 't think they heard me that time woman woman you better believe i 'm a woman yeah
all right check it out
they are all jumping up and down
they are clapping for you because the hottest one of the night you deserve it ??? ???
you are ready to go in the studio and make a record man you got it going on ???
did you ever think that you would be up on this stage right now getting UNknown a UNknown the applause ?
you are so phenomenal you are so UNknown
you are UNknown you are brilliant on stage
it is like i can 't wait
every week i want to see what 's next
what rabbit you are going to pull out of your hat it is fantastic
you little tiger
i love that
look it is quite obvious i don 't need to tell you how good a singer you are
it is very very nice that you are actually enjoying every second you are having on this show
we hear previous contestants saying it was my stepping stone it was this
you are loving it and so you should
this is your time in the spotlight
a million percent we will see you next week
well said by all three at that table congratulations
don 't look so scared own it
thank you UNknown doolittle
here are the numbers
remember keep trying
don 't let your favorite down
vote even if you think they are safe
thank you UNknown and the band
well done tonight live
stay tuned for the wedding bells
one of thousands of UNknown families who endured atlantic UNknown to find a new life
for them europe was rotten and UNknown
america was from the beginning the finest country in the world
these new americans tamed and claimed the land for themselves
they demanded and with their sweat secured the right to worship their own gods and make themselves their own masters
go west young man they were told and they did
the space and simplicity of the myth have become confused and UNknown in a million films records songs and stories
to fight like a man to die like a man is part of the myth
but the myth UNknown the UNknown reality of violent death
the western hero has simple religious beliefs
he is truthful and brave
just the same he 's a killer
johnny cash is a folk singer who can reach out to his audience and become the western hero before their eyes
ln this film he sings to an audience many of whom have known violence at first hand
not UNknown as in the myths of the golden west but real dangerous and bringing retribution
they are the inmates of one of the toughest prisons in america
san quentin in california where the wagons stopped
the past and the present come together when johnny cash enters this jail
who UNknown e you got there ?
i UNknown e got john with me
all right come on in
put your hand out please
man you 'r e in the wrong place to bend over don 't you know it ?
get up from there with that camera
i had some fella say the minute he walked in he was scared to death
everybody 's playing their own little game trying to get out of this madhouse i 'd call it actually
they 'r e family men they have wives and kids in a lot of cases and they UNknown e come here for some such crime or something like that
but mostly they 'r e not unlike the average guy on the streets with the exception of being inside
first week i was here there were something like three or four killings and the strangest thing about it i just heard about it
haven 't seen them just heard about UNknown m
but they did happen
but we walked about it 's about a three four minute walk
i got to the chow hall and sat down a fella came up and says
you heard about that fella got hit with a two by four ?
i said UNknown here ?
right in front of your cell
how sweet !
you can do too much time it makes you UNknown where you can 't think for yourself
i can remember the times there were you know if i saw somebody stabbed or saw somebody hurt or something like that where it would bother me
i 'm getting to the point now where it almost doesn 't concern me
laughter in here is a gift lf you can laugh in here then you can make it
say man when are you going back to florida ?
i don 't know
well i don 't care if i do die do die
i 'd like to ask my wife
june carter come back
i 'm ready to go to jackson
june and i have been singing our version of a john sebastian song
it wasn 't a chaotic thing you know in their mind
it was mom 's apple pie and
it might have been beans but everybody had a full belly
you know things of this nature
carl perkins wrote a song that tells about the reason for it all
they 'r e hiding us you know ?
that society out there has created a good many of us
i myself feel that the greatest crime a UNknown portion of us in san quentin are guilty of is one thing that we were born poor
being a convict in california especially you know you 'r e not even allowed to fight for your country
we 'r e exposed to a kind of a machine like justice here which just UNknown us out you know because of our UNknown maybe
we 'r e of no consequence what happens to us
they really get upset you know
you sit there and talk for about a half hour or something and for me it 's kinda
i seem to kind of get in a state of UNknown it 's like unreal
it takes a lot of imagination sometimes to write a song and to really put something in so that somebody else can feel it
we UNknown e been in several prisons san quentin and UNknown prison and the UNknown mississippi jail
el paso jail
i was walking down the street i 'm gonna sing for you a little bit later
i was walking down the street you know going to get some cigarettes or something about two o UNknown lock in the morning after a show i think it was
anyway i reached down to pick a UNknown here and a daisy there as i went along and this car pulls up
get in here boy what are you doing ?
said 'i m just picking flowers
well 36 for picking flowers and a night in jail
god damn no telling what they UNknown l do if you pull an apple
lf any of the guards are still speaking to me could i have a glass of water ?
san quentin just for you
san quentin you been livin hell to me
you UNknown e UNknown me since UNknown
i UNknown e seen UNknown m come and go and i UNknown e seen UNknown m die
and long ago i stopped askin why
san quentin i hate every inch of you
you UNknown e cut me and have scarred me through and through
and i walked out a wiser weaker man
mr congressman you can 't understand
san quentin what good do you think you do ?
do you think i UNknown l be different when you 'r e through ?
you bend my heart and mind and you UNknown my soul
and your stone walls turn my blood a little cold
san quentin may you rot and burn in hell
may your walls fall and may i live to tell
may all the world forgets you ever stood
and may all the world regrets you did no good
san quentin i hate every inch of you
the inmate comes in many of them that come in i think are afraid
and i feel that this type of thing UNknown a lot of inmates
i think practically every inmate in an institution has his own way of survival
this causes him to not be able to act himself
i UNknown e seen cases where inmates have wrapped their arms with toilet paper to make UNknown m look big and UNknown up
i UNknown e seen UNknown m do many things to do this
most of the people here are paranoiac
ln other words they 'r e all afraid something is going to happen to them in one sense or another
a UNknown thing between one group against another and resulted in the majority of the inmates in the institution UNknown
when you came out of the mess hall that day you walked right into the middle of a racial UNknown
and it was black on one side and mexican and white on the other side
and you were just UNknown forced into you know going to your own by nothing else but skin UNknown
you had no choice
i don 't believe in UNknown
especially in prison
as far as i 'm concerned i have no part of UNknown
i was raised like they were i had nothing
i 'd go out and steal what i wanted to get
they want everything on a platter
you don 't get nothing on a platter today
i started out in the department some 22 years ago working with youngsters
from 18 some of them even as young as 16 to 25 years old
so i just picked it up started robbing
this concerns a 1 4 year old girl and two 16 year old girls
we had a sort of a l don 't know what going on you know
and the police came in
i figured that money would cure all the problems i had and take care of all my needs at the time which i realise now this isn 't true
don 't get me wrong i still like money but i know that 's an improper way of obtaining it
i 'm 32 years old now
i UNknown e been doing it ever since
i UNknown e been doing it every day i do it every day seven days a week
and you know it gets to be like a job you know ?
and there 's days where i don 't steal and i get depressed
know what i mean ?
and the next day i go out and i steal double
and then i feel happy
i used to be a professional fighter and lost my temper one time and hit somebody and hurt him pretty bad so my beef is assault that 's my problem
mine is mostly a problem with emotions
i always have and always will but
i was at a party and there was drink there and i was one of the drinkers
this woman was one of the drinkers too a friend of mine
she was a customer of mine at the station
and everybody else left
and during the evening
i strangled both of UNknown m
all i can remember clearly is her starting screaming
he 's UNknown me he 's UNknown me
call the police
when the judge told me i was to be taken to san quentin and be executed as prescribed by law
and all i could do was just look at the judge and that 's it
but it really hits you when they show you your slip of paper your UNknown of your death sentence
and i looked at that slip of paper and it said on march 10th at UNknown you will be executed
that hits you when you know these people aren 't kidding
i mean an elevator five floors and put him in a holding cell where he stays for the night
all UNknown that haven 't already been made are made at that time
we find out naturally what he wants for his dinner that night
what kind of UNknown if any that he wants to listen to
lf he wants coffee or if he wants tea or milk or whatever the case may be
then if he hasn 't previously done so we find out his religious preference
who he would like to spend some time with him during the night if anyone
notify his people
mostly small things
some of these fellas that you 'r e neighbours with
the kind of life they UNknown e led and
such a lot of them preaching on about their UNknown and all that
and actually everybody up there i think they 'r e scared but some of them don 't want to admit it
they keep trying to reassure themselves that they 'r e not scared
and this way they like to exaggerate a little
i UNknown e seen several fellas go downstairs to be executed next morning
the custom is that the evening when they take you down they come round shake hands you know you stop at each cell and shake hands
what can you say to a man that 's going down there to be executed ?
good luck ?
and some are on the verge of cracking
but you can see them just UNknown themselves so the tears won 't come and won 't show
and several of them have gone down there with tears in their eyes and UNknown shaking they 'r e all really scared
other guys i UNknown e seen going down smiling
couple of fellas have told me that one of the guys was practically running to the gas chamber
he wanted to get it over with
i would say at first they 'r e afraid
but i think after a few days they get in a routine and they live a comparatively easy good life on condemned row during the time they 'r e waiting
they 'r e fed exceptionally well
because they do an awful lot of cell time they get a couple two and a half hours of exercise in the corridors during the day
and this is about all
the only time they get to go outside is when they 'r e going to and from visits
i was born and raised brought up as a catholic
i was an altar boy and
then when i got older i sort of UNknown away from my church but it brought me back to my faith
not because of the crime just it
i figure i 'd still think this way if i 'd have probably stayed with my church
went to church every sunday and
i probably wouldn 't have wound up here
we went into the little town of UNknown just over the hill from nazareth
and there 's a church that sits over the UNknown where the water came from that christ turned to wine where the first miracle was performed
we went into the church saw the UNknown you can hear the sounds of the water in there hear the echo
i was so impressed when i came out of the church if i ever had an inspiration i had one then from seeing what i had just seen and heard
and i said under my breath he turned the water into wine of all things
on the way in the car in the next few minutes i wrote this song
the executions are normally carried out at UNknown on UNknown
just prior to the execution we go into the cell and dress him
he normally wears a pair of blue jeans and a white shirt
at approximately three minutes after ten we UNknown l get the directions and the man is placed in the chamber
then the chamber is sealed and on the word from the warden the gas is applied
almost in all cases the reaction is the same
from the time the man is placed in the chamber until he 's pronounced dead is not longer than 1 4 or 15 minutes
he is to all UNknown and purposes dead long before that
the ones that i UNknown e witnessed were very easy
most of them want to go in a valiant fashion
they think it 's important to die like a man
my mother came to see me in the morning it was a little difficult trying to more or less soothe her feelings she was more UNknown than i was
i was scared i always have been scared but
i told her this is the way it 's gonna be and i 'm gonna go
i didn 't wanna go but you just can 't do anything at that time
i was prepared
but i was in a little bit of a daze though
i was thinking about tomorrow morning what was going to happen the next morning rather
and managed to survive that afternoon
and then i heard them coming up for me
the four officers that usually come up to take a man down to the holding cell next to the gas chamber
and then the officer came down and he said
you 'd better sit down i got some news for you
and i knew my attorney was trying to contact justice douglas
but he must have got in contact with him because the officer told me it was going to the state
it was just like a big load coming off your shoulders
and i did get down and say a prayer bowed down on my knees and said a prayer of thanks
speedy gonzales the son of the approximately seven brothers
a bottle of whiskey and a coke for the kid
another ones water UNknown
maybe you just can 't shoot ?
or maybe i UNknown ?
speedy gonzales ?
no they 'r e free
on the contrary do you want some more ?
on the house
you 'r e just passing by i suppose ?
i 'm afraid that you have gone too far away from home now
and you might never find your way back unless you leave soon
unless they pass by very quickly like you surely will ?
who was it ?
yes and i UNknown l continue it
what 's up clyde ?
you recognised me again ?
it was nothing
maybe it ate something bad
or maybe it has too small hide
let 's UNknown it so it can grow more
maybe it 's a kangaroo since it has bags under the eyes
yes and there 's bags on the knees too
it must be a kangaroo
those are good at jumping i tell you
here 's the stick
go on !
he must be leaving town soon
i UNknown l give you some
no don 't give so long UNknown
such a small animal can 't eat so long UNknown
we have to cut UNknown m shorter
here you go
i 'm speedy gonzales
for a moment i thought he 's back from dead
he 's my brother
hello bat masterson
couldn 't i have just one more
i 'm thinking of going to bank tomorrow
two normal sizes
ten of spades jack of spades UNknown
queen of spades king of spades and a ace of spades
bat you 'r e playing honest
what do you mean ?
i won !
two ace of spades !
i never cheat
i raise 2
UNknown will check how 's your biting
how much was it ?
do you want more ?
i bet all in
everything is little messed up in this town
i advice you to leave and forget it all
you 'r e fast
one large UNknown coffin !
my pa died finally !
that 's so sad hoss
one large size
i UNknown l pay !
finally i can start having some good time
i was so pissed off UNknown the cows all the time
how about your kid brother joe ?
i guess he bit the dust too
don 't let me die laughing !
it was me
you better stop digging this case and leave this town
then i have to shoot you too
raise your little hands up !
same goes for you missy !
and for you !
i don 't know
i got nothing
it 's true !
oh it 's you clyde ?
what a rotten luck !
you didn 't recognise me ?
not at all
you never know
they made a good job
they were professionals you see
what are they doing here in our place ?
don 't be sad clyde !
i give you something from my own pocket so it 's not a futile visit
here you go something for you too
don 't put your gun away during the robbery
someone could see
you 'r e welcome
have you ever seen a man hanged with the guns still on his belt ?
you could be the UNknown of the west
but i 'm even slower
are you picking a fight with me ?
i only said that i 'm the UNknown of the world
senorita would be very wise if she 'd take his boyfriend with her and leave this town
but before that UNknown and senorita will hmm why not ?
it 's clean now
and what 's there ?
dust and shells
i was supposed to rob a bank and it 's almost their closing time
is it really ?
be once a man and rob a train or something !
go on now !
it 's a quiet bunch here
they 'r e getting nervous
believe me you better leave here
what the hell is going on here ?
there 's too many of them
can 't you just leave before it 's too late ?
it 's already too late
one of you boys killed my brother
maybe it was you
even if i have to shoot you all
one by one
of course we could deal with you differently
but we are gentlemen and we don 't like killing
it 's a clean bottom sonny
what else ?
claudia what ?
we can accuse her of mental cruelty and the holes in your ass
this is a robbery
i said hands up and go against the wall !
and i said
come again some other day !
this trial can be started
bring in the defendant !
and what 's the charge ?
he shot banker to his belly because he was too slow to turn his back
and what the defense has to say ?
the late banker was known as should i say UNknown man
he was very negative towards poor bill UNknown
because he cowardly always tried to turn his back
clyde has proved with his many former robberies to be a proper bank robber
who didn 't harm the personnel
so if a man happens to miss a shot with his gun
i don 't think that 's so aggravating
i think that 's very sensible
so shall we hear more witnesses or shall we let him go ?
as a prosecutor i want to hear more UNknown so we can have a laugh
UNknown could you say a few words ?
i think clyde is innocent
banker 's death was a result of a wrong choice of a career
it 's wrong that one man keeps a lot of money locked up
while people amigos
although with all those pesos we could build a better society
or amigos drink some good tequila !
if banker had chose to be a farmer
he would be tending a little sheep on his little farm right now loved by all
and he 'd live today and with good luck also tomorrow
i think that
any other witnesses ?
if there was no money in the bank when clyde was robbing it banker gave from his own purse
that was true friendship my friends !
but he went too far with it
he couldn 't stand watching clyde suffering from his failures
when clyde once again fumbled with his gun and couldn 't hit with it
banker wanted to prevent clyde feeling incompetent
and shot himself in the belly thus letting clyde feel some well deserved joy of killing
that was true friendship boys
that 's right !
strange thing is that such a bad shooter could hit from such a short distance
let 's go for drinks everyone
clyde is free to go
190 UNknown UNknown UNknown
now he UNknown l be buried next to his brother
UNknown i thought he began to discover it all
amigo it was a close call
i wonder who shot him
at least it wasn 't me
moses needed to be killed
and only one interested will be soon six feet under
it 's best to hold our tongue on this matter
no one knows who killed moses gonzales if someone happens to ask about it
amigo you need to remind the sheriff and the bartender too
also no one knows who killed speedy gonzales
but we don 't know who did it anyway
tom bury him deep !
i don 't like ghosts
bat why don 't you offer me a glass of whisky
well now 's there a bullet hole ready
i UNknown l be the boss around here from now on
if someone has something against it he 's welcome to draw
you pulled it off ?
i don 't exactly know what has happened and how you 'r e here again but you better drink that whisky and hit the road
before you end up like your brother
a bullet in the back right ?
you might guess what i want to ask ?
i know nothing about death of moses
i doesn 't matter who kills you and i 'm the first one in the queue of killers
i wasn 't there myself but the others
it happened like
well what 's the problem ?
this is a UNknown
i was eating strawberries on the railway and i saw the whole thing
did you recognise anyone ?
i clearly saw UNknown masterson hoss and clyde
but not others ?
this information was worth of gold
i thought so
i hope it 's not nickel
right there 's our strawberry picker
amigos who UNknown l do it ?
it 's difficult to hit a moving target
clyde couldn 't hit him anyway
yes i could
i don 't believe you
what did i say ?
second one hit already but i made it sure
i UNknown e always said that strawberries are dangerous to your health
that 's so
we 'r e under the threat of death penalty
otherwise we UNknown l be all hanged
that 's how it was
even if you shoot me
my UNknown are getting numb
what are we waiting for ?
bomb is placed now and they 'r e both inside
yep the vultures will have a flying lunch soon
shall i do it yet ?
follow them !
you go there !
and you there
i UNknown e run out of bullets
last one again
come on !
fortunately we get more men tomorrow shut up !
i just said that we
i said shut up !
i just said
nothing 's gonna stop me
you won 't shed ash to my hand anymore speedy gonzales
come here you coward !
in the morning we UNknown l go to the shore of indian pond to ambush speedy
what are you thinking ?
i have a feeling that they UNknown l go to the shore of indian pond to ambush us
but i think that speedy knows that we 'r e going to ambush him in the shore of indian pond
so he UNknown l go to the mountains
but sheriff will figure that i know they UNknown l ambush me in the shore of indian pond
so they go to the mountains but we UNknown l go
we UNknown l go to sleep
good night !
it 's your final moments now
you can 't shoot because i have the girl
it 's easy to shoot when there 's a hole already
it 's your turn now speedy
why haven 't you shot me until now ?
i missed you on the first time
and it was fun to watch you kill a bunch of bandits during this time
only one left now
you shot bill last year
did you know who he was ?
and i chose bill
what the hell ?
they tried to kill me and it was close too
but now i got out of the cellar

there are good honest families out there like the UNknown who need us
stick his head down the UNknown again ?
i don 't know nothin about the job on the UNknown but what i do know is george ain 't dead
he paid me to identify his body except it was some old tramp that 'd been burnt in a fire
george made sure his sovereign ring was found on the body
told me he wanted to disappear to spain
that 's the last i saw of him
the man who was buried was a tramp
UNknown paid mickey to identify him
good work UNknown
if i may UNknown dorothy parker i don 't think we should put all our eggs in one bastard
what other bastard have we got ?
well you don 't still think it 's mickey ?
i don 't know but there might be someone else in the frame now
well who is he ?
who do we know who had a spanish boyfriend ?
i UNknown e got to know them over the months yeah
got to know their UNknown and UNknown
where they kept things in the house like bryan drake 's wages
you 'r e accusing me of stealing from bryan ?
or maybe you told george where the money was kept
don 't piss us about sweetheart
you UNknown e got a make up round on his old stomping ground
he 's been in spain
you speak spanish
in a cell
what did he look like ?
did he leave a name ?
is that a yes or a no ?
is that all i 'm gonna get ?
am i ?
i bet beneath that hard shell of yours there 's a softer side people never see eh ?
you 'r e a bit like clint UNknown aren 't you ?
am i ?
we 'r e not even liked
in fact we 'r e hated by some
what would you do instead ?
join the army
yeah but a dead hero 's no use to anyone is he ?
yeah it 's bryan drake
bryan with a y
i 'm not
i want my headline
i 'm busy tonight
no he 's english as far as i know
is it serious ?
you stay where you are
go ahead shoot though i have to warn you that you may be getting rid of the one person who could help you here
so don 't be scared
you make UNknown phone calls you send me roses
like some sort of crazed UNknown and you tried to poison me
i shouldn 't be scared ?
well i had to make sure you were the person i was looking for
and you are
apparently you and i are the only two
is that why you 'r e here ?
to help me get home ?
you and i are the only two people here who actually know what that means
still it 's a relief to talk about it yes ?
as for helping you well that depends
you 'r e a cop ?
that 's why you sent me the roses isn 't it ?
operation rose could be your exit route
it 's about police corruption
mac he warned us about it
it won 't be pretty
but how much do you want to see your daughter again ?
if you 'r e so sure you can get me home why are you still here ?
you 'r e not the only one whose dying here alex
mine is a very slow and painful death
i could go back but i don 't want to
you on the other hand have a decision to make as to what you 'r e willing to do to have that chance
you want me to be corrupt ?
think about it alex
i haven 't got much time to wait for an answer
and sadly neither have you
will you find out everything you can about a man called martin summers
is he a suspect ma 'a m ?
not exactly no
matter of life or death ?
he 's a retired cop
who said she lied ?
come on guv she knew that money was in the biscuit tin
elsie 's not a UNknown
she never took a penny from any of UNknown jobs
i bet she didn 't even know the money was in there
why call her in then ?
cos george thought the cock eyed world of his mum
we keep her here he UNknown l start wondering where she is
what about UNknown mason ?
are you ready elsie love ?
see you later
you look after yourself
you know where he is six feet under
you trying to send me UNknown ?
hello again dear
she popped in yesterday for a UNknown
said she was an old friend of george 's
what are you two waiting for ?
go get her back here now !
a word of advice blondie don 't even think about lying again or you UNknown l be seeing me in your nightmares for the rest of your life
i wasn 't lying
he is dead
he isn 't the man you think he is
he is trying to change
rearrange the following words
i swear i had no idea he was going to rob marjorie and bryan
i couldn 't believe it
i felt so bad for them
but not bad enough that you couldn 't come to us ?
how could you do that to them ?
i 'm sorry
you 'r e not leaving here till you tell us
what 's it worth ?
we don 't respond to bribery
i thought this was the met ?
the peacock UNknown UNknown
you just make sure he 's there tonight UNknown and don 't even think about doing a runner
in these heels ?
cash on delivery
use a friendly blonde to case the joint for you and bingo he 's in
how could she do that to them ?
she 's supposed to be their friend
now bryan 's deaf for the rest of his life
you don 't know that
well i 'd better stop then
if only i could have done something
you can 't blame yourself
you don 't understand you can never understand
if i 'd remembered then i could have stopped it
listen to me we have the public 's faith in us going down faster than linda UNknown
one thing i can be sure of is that gene hunt will find this UNknown and put him away till the end of his days
come on dry your eyes UNknown we UNknown e got scum to catch
ray chris she 's on her way
i feel better for giving up
the guv UNknown that everything UNknown l be all UNknown dory if we get UNknown
i reckon it 's too late the rot 's set in
we can 't let him get off with it can we ?
we 'r e coppers
ray is she there yet ?
nah not yet guv
ray check down the street
she UNknown l show
is she still breathing ?
yeah there 's a pulse
looks like UNknown found her before we did
must UNknown e UNknown that she was setting him up
george UNknown is a vicious bastard so why didn 't he finish her off ?
maybe he thought he had ?
he 's still out there somewhere
right when the ambulance gets here you two can accompany UNknown here to the hospital
the doctors say his hearing may come back in time
stay positive isn 't that what they say ?
i UNknown e only just opened it
we haven 't long been back from the hospital
it 's 163 ; 500
was there a note ?
we think she might have had something to do with the robbery
he won 't say you know what lads are
yeah would you like me to have a chat
would you ?
oh you UNknown e got blue eyes can i come in ?
i 'd forgotten it did that
suzie your girlfriend ?
you just have to remember the UNknown really
i don 't smoke it
i know where you keep it
don 't go in there don 't go in
what 's this necklace doing here ?
is this the one your mum
this is the necklace that was stolen
is this the bad thing you did when you were a UNknown
you 'r e a thief !
it 's him
what ? !
what 's he doing with his mum 's stolen necklace
where does he get the money to buy weed ?
he 's too bloody lazy to get a job
he 's only 14
have you been at the gin ?
you don 't know what he 's like
he is UNknown two timing two faced UNknown selfish little shit
about six inches more
i UNknown e seen a bloke from UNknown balance a UNknown on his hampton wick but i UNknown e never ever seen anything like that before
i just don 't get it
the top half
a bloody great big knob
it 's like something out of a german porn film
must UNknown e had surgery done to the face at the same time cos you wouldn 't know him
well you didn 't
just you wait boys before you know it you UNknown l all be asking for a back crack and sack
is that UNknown speak for rice UNknown ?
what ever next ?
geoff UNknown starts playing with barbie dolls ?
UNknown john fancies blokes ?
i don 't get it
so down below he was gonna have it er
well actually they tuck it up inside the
you all eyed him up
it could be sensitive
wake up gloria
where am i ?
you better start talking or you UNknown l be saying goodbye to your UNknown sooner than you think UNknown
i UNknown l only talk if you call me by my name UNknown
why the hell should i when you 'r e still half george ?
still the same thieving scumbag
i 'm not
it 's in your genes
not until you call me by my name
should i stay or should i go now ?
should i stay or should i go now ?
if i go there will be trouble
if i stay it will be double
so come on and let me know should i stay or should i go ?
where did you have the breast UNknown ?
what only gave you one UNknown ?
UNknown their price
why did you have to hurt bryan ?
it was a mistake
i was just desperate for the money for the op
to be the person i always knew i was
so why did you come back to the UNknown ?
i knew i 'd left my UNknown there
marjorie asked me to look after peter then i was stuck
i don 't blame him for what he did
what did he do ?
he saw me wearing his mum 's necklace
chased after him he thought i was going to attack him or something
he picked up a brick
i felt a thud on the back of my head
next thing i 'm in here
why did you go and see elsie ?
to say goodbye
so you left her the money in her tin ?
promise me one thing ?
don 't tell her the truth
it 'd break her heart
you my little UNknown friend are in no position to make demands
sending scum like you down might restore people 's faith in us a little bit
ray cuff him
UNknown me up is not gonna stop me putting these on you
so forget it
besides UNknown 's not your colour
why 's your face all red ?
cos it 's hot in here
why did you give the drake family that 500 quid ?
what 500 quid ?
was there ?
i UNknown l say !
i UNknown e no idea how it got there but when you told me about that poor bryan drake and i read about it in the papers
i felt sorry for him
you could have kept it for yourself and had a holiday in the UNknown
except it wasn 't mine was it ?
anyway what do i want to go to the bleedin UNknown for ?
can 't take the heat me
why didn 't you tell me what had happened instead of running away like that ?
cos i thought i 'd be in big trouble
i could UNknown e killed her
i thought i had
well technically you UNknown e assaulted someone
will i go to jail ?
possibly and you UNknown l probably end up sharing a cell with a great big bloke covered in scars and UNknown who UNknown l call you his bitch
whether it 's suzie or a girl called alex
be especially nice to her
it 's never too late peter
just the two of us we can make it if we try
just the two of us
just the two of us
just the two of us building castles in the sky
just the two of us
bye marjorie everything will be all right
wasted all of those years
and they don 't make those flowers grow
good things might come to those who wait
not for those who wait too late we UNknown e got to go for all we know
just the two of us
we can make it if we try
i mean that boy george he looks like a woman
yeah you fancied him before i told you
i did not
i haven 't been a UNknown UNknown have i ?
what are we seeing ?
i mean he 's not supposed to be here like me
thanks anyway UNknown
have a good night
i ain 't got a clue
you know i thought i knew it all UNknown
now i 'm beginning to wonder maybe i know the square root of jack shit
is this where i 'm supposed to disagree with you ?
it 's just my luck
i could retire on this
be known as the bloke who UNknown george UNknown when all around failed
you still could
it 's not her fault she loves him
what did you tell her ?
UNknown mason 's been arrested for the robbery
of course you did
damn you gene hunt
because despite all the UNknown put downs the insults the pathetic UNknown side UNknown underneath it all you are a good kind decent man
keep your voice down somebody might hear
i am going to buy you a very large drink
are you seeing boris again ?
luigi put them on my tab
i owe you one anyway
what for ?
you posted it ?
i haven 't got much bloody choice have i ?
you 'r e not such a bad copper you know
i know you could be my only chance of getting back
and you know how much i miss my daughter
i would do anything to see her again
but what you want me to do what you want me to be is corrupt and dishonest
i 'm sorry but i simply can 't
and so the answer is thanks but no thanks
i don 't know how but i UNknown l find my own way back
i had a feeling you were going to say something like that
i think you did the right thing signorina drake

well what more do i have to do ?
it 's what you have to be
what do i have to be ?
you only think about money
i work for money
half of what i earn is spent on transport
all you think of is money

so you 'r e alone
i 'd have brought you some food if i had known
you UNknown e been kind of funny lately selim
funny how ?
we have nothing for you
i want a man 's shirt

no there 's no place for you to try it on
this is my favorite shade of blue
how does it look ?
it 's your choice
a customer might come in
are you scared we UNknown l be busted ?
a handsome shop owner
UNknown for god 's sake
oh don 't get mad i 'm leaving
i 'm buying this shirt but i don 't want to carry it around
please bring it when you come home
i UNknown l pay you at home
you better take it now
don 't tell me you don 't like money
i like it but
there 's no end to that
have you ever stolen anything ?
when you were a kid ?
once i threw a hotel towel into my suitcase
i UNknown e never stolen anything
years ago i had bought shoes and by mistake they gave me back as change three times the amount i had given them
what did you do ?
i took it and left
you stole it you mean
i was in high school
one night my uncle 's family came to visit us
my uncle had this beautiful lighter
i couldn 't take my eyes off it
at one point he dropped the lighter in the armchair
it slid beneath the cushion
i waited quietly all night
first thing i did in the morning was to pocket the lighter
that 's also stealing !
is there a limit to what you would do for money ?
UNknown i should be going now
of course there is
that 's a little difficult
when will the UNknown arrive ?
any day now
it 's very good stuff
am i fired ?
you tore my shirt
it could be worse
my shirt is torn
i don 't complain and you tell me my shirt
who is it ?
the UNknown is for you
when is UNknown coming back ?
i was about to go to bed
i 'm tired
i UNknown l take my shirt
that 's right
how much ?
it 's the first time i UNknown e seen you in a stylish shirt like that
three white shirts size three two short sleeves size one
for our waiters
are there any blues ?
one blue large largest you UNknown e got
make it two
38 400 000
130 dollars plus 22 pounds
here 's a 100 francs
we 'r e 2 pounds short
you UNknown l accept turkish lira ?
it 's okay
i said empty it !
i was robbed
around 70 80 million
don 't bother
maybe they UNknown l catch him
we shouldn 't let these thieves get used to this
i can 't tell you
that 's even better
let 's call right away
he 's just a poor guy
you 'r e really something selim
the guy comes and robs you one day after he 's dismissed and you forgive him
only if he makes this into a habit we UNknown l be ruined
i 'd get him caught if i were you
or if you like we can get him and get the money back
you probably know his whereabouts
thank you UNknown i UNknown l take care of it
do you know his address ?
well how will you find him ?
the police can trace him from his name
they sure can
excuse my saying so but i think this is stupidity
you know best
do you want to use it now ?
just a minute then
mr h UNknown in !
you haven 't even touched UNknown 's dish
she says 'i insisted but he didn 't want
she had to force the 'd UNknown 's on you
she must have invited you to her house too !
well how about that ?
she bought a shirt
she had something else in mind
oh how vulgar !
she got worse after the divorce !
UNknown has built a very nice house on the shore
i loved it
i went and looked at our piece of land
one of the olive trees has gone dry
UNknown said 's ell it we UNknown l get a small place for you here on the shore and you can build a house i said you wouldn 't want
so what do you say ?
but first we should buy this flat
everybody thinks you UNknown e got a lot of money
well well i see you UNknown e fired the helper !
isn 't that right ?
you fired him didn 't you ?
what did this one do ?
he looked okay
the new generation
you can 't leave the shop for a second
no i 'm not hiring anyone
it 's better like this
you 'r e a terrible boss
yesterday i found two incredible paintings
i couldn 't make out the signature
i 'm sure it 's a russian painter
the antique dealer doesn 't know how valuable they are
i would make a fortune
that 's what you said last time
that was furniture
how much does he want ?
180 for both
even this is UNknown cheap
if you have money give it to me and i UNknown l pay you back in a week adding ten percent to it
i don 't
you UNknown e squandered away all your money this way
forget about it
you UNknown l regret it
just let me get the money
say hello to the family for me
going out to lunch
what 's up ?
by the way is there any news ?
news about what ?
did you do anything ?
you ruined my clothes
give me the bill
no bring me the bill !
no sir i swear i won 't !
i said bring the bill !
i 'm sorry sir
there are so many fake dollars
oh of course please !
don 't mention it !
26 350 000 liras
i don 't know a good one
this is the best
not even when you kiss
do you have a red one ?
there are all kinds of reds
a red one
it 's supposed to stay on
about the flat
let 's not pay rent anymore
but it doesn 't seem right to buy this flat
it 's been our home for years
it 's a good place
the neighborhood is getting very expensive
if not this one another place
the thing is to stop paying rent
you UNknown l say again UNknown UNknown should we have our own property ?
but why are we buying this one ?
why don 't we buy a better one ?
don 't we deserve a better one ?
look at you you UNknown e always said we can 't buy let 's not buy and now you look down on this flat !
i wouldn 't mind i wish we could !
selim you 'r e funny
i wonder why
no i just thought about it
thought and made a decision
selim are you joking honey ?
weren 't you the one who was always saying i can 't go into that kind of commitment ? what about money ?
he must have taken care of that loan
we UNknown l take care of it
we UNknown l take care of that too
the time will come for that too !
the last time you bought me a present was when UNknown was born
six years ago
we should first take care of that
you always say 'm UNknown isn 't easy to earn
let 's not UNknown
of course it does
mr UNknown said hi
he meant it as a joke
good day to you
have you got rice pudding ?
unfortunately we don 't
no thank you
i ate too much
i saw these leather UNknown and stopped
UNknown has been talking about a new couch
leather UNknown cost a fortune man
where will you get all that money ?
actually leather is so UNknown it 's like an investment
considering a couch an investment proves you 'r e a bad UNknown
what 's a good UNknown doing here ?
you 'r e right actually
but you know i 'm sick and tired of it
i don 't feel like staying in the shop
i 'm always telling you man
pay him well
well anyway that 's harder for me
what about those paintings ?
are they still for sale ?
selim are you serious ?
i 'm sure they are
i thought you didn 't have any money
i received a large payment
check it out if you like we UNknown l go together to look at them one day
you 'r e great
one thing nobody should know about the paintings
a dishwasher 's so practical
you did well to buy one
did you buy it on installment ?
oh no !
why if you have money ?
to earn more money with money
you say if you have money that 's such a weird thing
you can 't spend it
i mean not like you want because it 's always for something
well that 's not having money
i don 't know
money that 's spent doesn 't bring pleasure
and then there 's spending and spending
you UNknown l spend it for your pleasures
i UNknown l spend it by UNknown
i UNknown l buy a house some land
that 's not spending
i think that has to do with how the money is earned
it 's easy to spend money that 's earned easily
there 's spending the money you saved and spending the money you got from the lottery
that 's what you think until you hit the lottery
after you put the money in your pocket it 's as difficult to spend as the money you UNknown e saved
now UNknown is not the type to spend easily
well of course there are limits
UNknown spends as he likes when he has money
but what has he saved over the years ?
won 't we all end up in the same place ?
is it worth it ?
it certainly isn 't !
you 'r e absolutely correct pal
you know selim something has come over you
you 'r e more relaxed easier
i think because you understand that money that 's spent feels better
he realized that he won 't become rich some day
so why not spend it he thinks
listen to this
the year twenty years now right selim ?
selim is playing right back
i 'm at left field
we 'r e playing against UNknown
the score is 2 2
no 3 3
the referee whistles for penalty
so he gets up he isn 't hurt but he 's pulling this long face !
he says 'i fell down on my own
i say quietly but the referee called a penalty
but i fell down on my own he says again
UNknown the bear is getting ready for the penalty kick
he heard what selim said
he looked at selim
i tried to take this guy aside but he walked right up to the referee
selim said softly 'i fell down on my own
the referee looked at him pretended not to hear and went ahead with the penalty kick
UNknown the bear kicked that ball so hard
the ball went over and out and the game ended up 3 3
so UNknown the bear came and slapped selim in the face real hard
i never knew this !
i can 't believe you played soccer anyway
it 's not like you at all
selim is so honest
UNknown made you pay for the goal he missed
he 's not either
but an honest UNknown
you were a little embarrassed too weren 't you because we UNknown e spent so much lately ?
the dishwasher new furniture
if only they knew !
knew what ?
so we started to spend a lot on everything compared to before
it 's nothing to be embarrassed about
but confess that you were
that 's why you said you bought the tv on installment
actually you paid for it in advance didn 't you ?
well that 's not being dishonest
UNknown is in favor of buying everything on installment
i said it so he wouldn 't start preaching again
i didn 't say it was dishonest honey !
can anybody be as honest as you ?
everybody says so
my purse is gone !
where can it be ?
my whole salary 's in it !
let nobody out !
i just checked it a minute ago
it happened this minute !
a brown purse !
ladies and gentlemen !
the police will conduct a search at the first stop
lady there 's something under that seat
is it yours ?
is it all there ?
thank god !
how can a purse drop off from a closed handbag ?
even if it did how did it get so far ?
if it 's so valuable keep your eye on it !
shut up !
officer i 'd like to make a complaint about this woman !
she calls all these people 't UNknown
aren 't you ashamed to accuse these honest working people ?
how dare you ?
okay folks curfew is over !
you can go out if you like
nobody 's onto the fortune lying there
are we going ?
look selim i hope you 'r e not worried about this
aren 't we buying them together ?
have you changed your mind ?
no i haven 't
are you out of money ?
there 's no money problem
i don 't know if you want to
let 's go
no come on
let 's go
he was an incredible painter
can you see the UNknown of that dark ?
it 's okay
are you buying them ?
you UNknown e bought two fine paintings if you ask me
but this is all it 's worth
maybe some amateur would be willing to pay a little more
what i mean is don 't expect too much
the man is obviously a good businessman
a skilled merchant
it 's evident from the brush strokes that it 's mass production
is it bad if he 's a merchant ?
i don 't think these paintings were made like that
well if i say more you UNknown l raise the price
no i 'm just asking what they 'r e worth
can we pay right away ?
my brother 's not home
mother and i don 't know what to do
have you got some fuse wire ?
would you mind looking ?
i liked your shop a lot
i UNknown l come again
my mother liked the shirt too
you went to a lot of trouble
thanks a lot selim
have a cup of coffee
you UNknown l miss the boat
i 'm not taking the boat anymore
i UNknown l open the shop half an hour later then
no customers that early anyway
you know best honey
let 's buy one daddy !
last year we didn 't talk to each other for a week because of this
you said what do we need a car for ?
will you exchange this ?
i want to exchange
it 's so nice !
i want to say something but don 't get mad
just so i UNknown l feel confident
why are we spending so much money ?
rather how can we ?
i robbed a bank
we 'r e spending it
it 's impossible to talk to you
why won 't you believe me ?
nothing has changed
what do you mean ?
you either have money or you don 't
let 's say i UNknown e received all payments at once
you 'r e a UNknown
how can people owe you ?
did you loan somebody money ?
why are you so curious ?
i don 't know
but there 's this UNknown i feel
i 'm scared
look around you
all of them said the paintings were very recent
the worst part is one of them said these paintings were made by that old antique dealer himself !
the scoundrel !
i UNknown l go and bring down his shop
let 's take them back
he won 't take them back
he won 't
it 's you who said that
but still he said russian
did he say i paint this rubbish my self ?
he didn 't
we were stupid
all the fault is mine
wasted all the money
i UNknown l take the police there
because that 's fraud isn 't it ?
poor guy !
i UNknown l take care of this !
let 's go together and have a talk
you are an antiques dealer
the stuff you sell has got to be old
everything we sell is old
your paintings are worth what you paid for them
i had already told you that you might not get anything higher
we 'r e returning them
we want our money back
that 's impossible
you can only sell the paintings back
that 's all i can do
it comes to the same thing
but i 'm a second hand dealer
i buy things for much less than their worth
meaning i UNknown l buy them back for one third of the price you paid for them
that is fraud !
buying old things at junk price selling them at their worth to amateurs
that 's how i make my living
there 's no crime in it
the crime is elsewhere
that won 't make any difference
isn 't it a crime to sell your paintings as antiques ?
i didn 't sell you any antiques
i sold you two paintings
is this honest trade ?
you will pay for it
so where 's the studio ?
where 's your antique workshop ?
okay UNknown stop it let 's go
you know what i like those paintings
i UNknown l keep them
don 't worry about the money
what 's done is done
i called the police right away
he was just passing by here
mr selim say something please
shut up or i UNknown l
mr selim tell them for heaven 's sake !
they say i robbed you with a gun !
tell them please !
what did i ever do to you ?
what you did is worse than theft you son of a bitch robbing the person who fed you !
was it him who robbed you ?
mr selim for god 's sake it 's a sin
i didn 't do it
well what 's done is done
it 's not important
let 's go to the station
you will tell us there
please give a detailed account
it 's just like i told you
how were you robbed ?
was it him ?
did he have a gun ?
tell it in detail
why don 't you say it man ?
was it this young man who robbed your shop ?
go and ask my family !
my mother !
you be quiet now
did he have a gun ?
yes a hand gun
no not exactly
i went in afterwards
i don 't remember
if it 's armed robbery it makes no difference if you make a complaint
plus if he had a gun how can you not remember ?
selim why don 't you say it ?
he robbed me holding a gun
i guess it 's new
enjoy it !
actually it 's fun to go on vacation like this as if we 'r e running away
especially when you UNknown e got a car
why should we run away ?
mom look at the lambs !
well did you decide where we 'r e going ?
i don 't know
so what ?
they 'r e all killers
they 'd poke your eye out
they 'r e fighting UNknown
i train them
people all around up to UNknown know me
ask and they UNknown l tell you
ask if they know ali the blind rooster guy
i not only train them i do the operations too
the salt and pepper one here i UNknown his UNknown yesterday
it was infected
it 's like wrestling
some sports !
there 's big money in this
do the UNknown get the money ?
no my girl !
with its tiny stomach
UNknown please give me that
daddy what does forgery mean ?
it 's making false money
how do they make it false ?
they make something that resembles money
why do they make it ?
do you need any help ?
right after the first village
two kilometers away
we sold these before they got it too
sold them at a loss
to a butcher ?
will they cut them up because they 'r e sick ?
but they pay less than the price of sick sheep
i swear we sell them for the price of dead sheep
well good bye now
UNknown you ask so many things !
come on we 'r e going
you 'r e worried about something
we can go back if you 'd like
i UNknown l go check to see if the newspapers have arrived
UNknown UNknown UNknown UNknown
the autopsy report points to the probability of suicide
shall we go ?
nothing wrong is there ?
we can 't take care of a dog in a flat
how did you get me out ?
i was very scared
what did i ever do to you ?
what 's this ?
leave me alone !
this is your share of the robbery
forget me and what happened
and don 't pass by the shop again
i always feel like i 'm using you
i always feel guilty towards you
what 's up ?
please take them down
it doesn 't look like you learned your lesson
you obviously have a new project in mind
yes i have a new project !
but this time i don 't think you UNknown l be interested in the least because it 's a project for making big money
it 's not for someone broke like you
i UNknown e had enough
i want to make money too
i 'm going into the historical objects business
don 't you protest selim
i UNknown e made up my mind
there 's not much difference between that and antiques anyway
i know you UNknown l say this is outright theft
it isn 't
and no harm is done to the historical object
it may be against the law but it 's not a sin
nobody is harmed
what 's the difference ?
a tombstone more a tombstone less
what difference does that make ?
don 't you try bringing me in on this
i already told you it 's not for you
i just wanted you to know
your friend will soon be playing around with billions
what size ?
unfortunately this is the only one we have
how much is it ?
2 800 000 liras
two and a half months
it 's almost over
don 't worry i UNknown l be okay
smugglers always live by turning each other in you know that
you can 't make money if you don 't take risks
you know that
but everything 's so expensive i just looked
it 's summer heat today
how can i ?
the gentleman said it did
he even paid
i UNknown e got four
all they know is to beat me
he 's no brother
but she said brother
really the bitch !
i 'm late
do you have an idea where i can find one ?
are they real ?
i 'm tired honey
i 'm very tired sweetheart
today my stomach hurts too
your stomach ?
i 'm very worried
i UNknown l tell you a secret
but even my father shouldn 't know okay ?
i UNknown e been wanting to tell you but i couldn 't find the opportunity let 's say
a while ago i hit the lottery
but you never play the lottery !
well the one time that i did i got lucky
well how much ?
why aren 't you glad ?
i bought you jewels and you 'r e questioning me
selim it 's true isn 't it ?
so all the UNknown
you 'r e right honey
they wouldn 't leave you alone
that 's why you were tense then !
you 'r e such a patient man
i couldn 't have kept it
let 's buy a flat first thing
we shouldn 't UNknown away that money
where 's the money ?
in the bank ?
why should anything bother me ?
you want to spend it all and finish it
you want to get rid of it
i UNknown l help you do that !
i don 't want to leave without you
selim please come with us !
i can 't
you 'r e a lucky man selim !
i 'm a lucky woman !
come on honey !
did you take the thermos ?
i can drive you to the wharf if you 'd like
too much trouble
we won 't worry about the cab fare !
oh my god
i brought you your electricity bill
they get lost downstairs
so UNknown is not home ?
they went to the island
why didn 't you go with them ?
the island is so nice in this season
i have to work
i hadn 't seen this couch
it 's so nice !
i UNknown l go now
selim thank you for the dress
oh selim !
how stupid !
pedro does it hurt ?
to me !
give me that
juan my love give me the pork leg
what a leg !
kids take your pork leg carefully
look at the birdie !
but it 's not the same if i roast it rather than one of the little UNknown
but you said
watch how it 's done
you take a few olives a few capers
you take four UNknown you put one two and the other two you eat
continue on your own and i UNknown l prepare the sauce
UNknown is the most important thing when cooking a pork leg
if not it tastes as if you 'r e eating fish
open the oven UNknown
you 'r e talking to yourself
i UNknown e told you that 's called praying
leave the table cloth alone
where 's this fabric from ?
i UNknown e told you already
tell me again
didn 't she take it when she went on her trip ?
a little bit
the same thing i do
tell them the snowman 's going to melt
i 'm not crazy !
UNknown is horrible
don 't open them
what 's your name ?
UNknown what about you ?
grandma 's crazy
she 's sad
i already gave you your pork leg
shouldn 't you be at grandma 's ?
grandma 's crazy
no she 's talking to herself and says that birds no longer fly
besides another UNknown like me arrived
what have you heard from your brother ?
the last time i saw him he told me he was coming to see the kid
isn 't your pork leg alive and kicking ?
go shower i will take care of it
who 's there ?
and the other UNknown ?
he also left
the invisible man ?
very good but you didn 't cook it
yes of course i did !
you have to put your name on it so that everyone knows
come over here there 's something i need to tell you
what are you kids doing ?
UNknown stay away from foolishness
kids come and see your present
daughter each day you 'r e prettier
dad don 't say things like that in front of your UNknown
look at your present
just as she always wanted
but it 's out in the patio gathering dirt
at least she made the pork roast today
thanks god !
military men don 't think
but mom look at you !
and look at the time
sit down !
everyone come close
the biggest ear is best !
the winners are the four ears !
now the best roast
and that one ?
i vote for UNknown 's
go get your suitcases
my grandpa 's not here !
happy new year !
UNknown someone has stolen your roast !
UNknown it 's me raul
what 's happening raul ?
they 'r e killing me
they torture me everyday
i can 't take it anymore
did you rat on me raul ?
answer me !
that 's what they told me that they 'd place us together so that you 'd kill me
how do i get out of here ?
they won 't stop beating you up
if you survive you UNknown l end up in a hospital and it 's easier to get out of there
don 't tell them that i spoke
fear is part of who you are nevertheless i 'm not frightened of torture
when policemen torture somebody they know that if someone betrays another they can humiliate him because he loses his morals his ethics
and that 's the only thing we have left
of course i 'm afraid of being tortured and all that crap but the truth is what i fear the most is running out of our sardine supply
shut up !
comrade the only one who eats sardines while hiding in the mountain is you
comrade you ratted on me
let 's do it again
i 'm UNknown
no not i
the party has sent me
give me the information
i had no idea who she even was
from now on you do exactly what i say
we 'r e also UNknown a war in here with dead and missing people
anyone can be weak and betray us
who ratted on you ?
i was followed
all you civilians are frightened by everything
gringo what type of music are you going to add on to it ?
a march ?
i 'd prefer doing that rather than follow the gringo around with his camera
UNknown that is also important we can 't remain isolated
some military men will join us and we UNknown l become a civic military army
military men ?
gringo you left us there
we 'r e doing badly but with military men one never really knows
besides we won 't be able to mention lenin or marx
we 'r e going to have to speak more of UNknown
and what are the russian comrades going to say ?
if any russian ever comes all the way up here we just tell him what happened
you 'r e alive because we caught you inside a house because if we had done so in the mountain you 'd be sliced open like a goat
you 'r e alive because we caught you inside a house because if we had done so in the mountain you 'd be sliced open like a goat
like a goat !
i simply went out to play a baseball game and on my way over there those military men seized me
i 'm a lieutenant
we 'r e also UNknown a war in here with dead and missing people
if we 'r e not on the look out anyone can be weak and betray us
that 's why we decided in the assembly that you are going to rat on me
jot this down
who would UNknown e thought that two years after john f kennedy 's death we 'd continue to miss him so dearly ?
till tomorrow when we meet again
welcome to your miss mayo program
today believe it or not we can 't eat our first recipe
have you noticed my hair 's beautiful shine ?
i also achieve that with UNknown
for your hair 's beauty UNknown it with UNknown length and UNknown wise using a UNknown
place a cap on for twenty minutes and i guarantee you UNknown l have a fabulous mane
let 's take a brief brake but we UNknown l be back
come with me
you are not at risk but someone 's ratted on us
they 'r e looking for each one of us
if this fails to arrive many will die
you must get up to here leave the car on the corner and the key in the glare flap
why are you dressed like that ?
oh come on
the army is UNknown this way and is coming closer
it 's best to cancel our UNknown vous with the other UNknown
this is a propaganda maneuver what really matters is that the gringo UNknown it on film
go and inform the other UNknown and you two head for the hamlet
if we 'r e really being followed by the army this is our last chance
seemingly i 'm going to inherit mom 's illness
i don 't want it
your roast was very pretty
you stole it !
whoever took it wanted to save it because they were going to eat it after midnight
stop it kid
this shirt always gets dirty !
it 's always filthy !
wash it and take the tag of
it 's bothering me
it 's bothering me
i UNknown e studied your case and i can get you out of here
stay as strong as you UNknown e always been
don 't let them drive you insane
are you getting me out of here ?
tell me where the weapons are
what are you doing ?
where did you get this glass ?
i made a deal
when i leave this place they can continue beating me up
they say you 'r e pretending to be crazy that you 'r e going to betray us
they UNknown l try you before a UNknown tribunal
true i cooked him
but you stole him !
even if you are my loving brother i cannot understand your revolution which leaves my children without food on new year 's eve
we want you to sign a statement where you confess to stealing pedro
i raised pedro so i 'm warning you
you must submit to popular demand
you must hand in the fish
you cannot be in charge of any animal 's security
gringo are you ok ?
stop the camera
that 's so dangerous
i wasn 't able to
here put this on
you are already about three months pregnant aren 't you ?
hey here you UNknown l be clara lopez
everything 's fine
have you heard from UNknown ?
he finally showed up
how can i find out about him ?
marta is the contact with our comrades in jail she 's the leader of the university 's lady 's committee
good morning !
but she 's just a child
it 's too risky
what is your name ?
short or long weapons ?
we have a UNknown study group
where do you keep your weapon when you sleep ?
our comrades who returned from moscow have cleared up a few issues
do you think a long weapon is too heavy for me ?
miss mayo gives you tips for your table
she 's dead !
the car stays here
is it true you are pregnant ?
do you know how dangerous that is ?
are you afraid ?
she also came from the mountain
did anything happen to her ?
i don 't know
what 's wrong with you UNknown ?
i saw my mom
it 's true !
stop making things up
her dress was the same as this
come with me
but my biggest fear is that they would harm someone i love
the grenades !
i had no idea and i cut them down
morons you can 't even manage one thing together
i won 't allow anything to happen to you
marta i need to ask you something
five of you go to this hallway
the other four ; here
i 'm going in through the elevator
you must wait for me to arrive here which is very close to the registers
when i arrive here which is the area where the registers are placed you will wait for me to give the signal
do you remember the signal ?
UNknown and fer open their UNknown and we put the money away
i know you know something about UNknown
what happened to him ?
UNknown was released from jail and now he 's in the sanatorium
take care of the money and the baby
if you don 't have any psychiatric disorders they UNknown l throw you back in jail
therefore it 's better if i examine you first
keeping quiet is the best thing you can do
that won 't happen
was it my uncle ?
no it was someone i didn 't know
so why did you cry ?
because if they think it 's your dad they won 't look for him anymore
are we coming tomorrow again ?
every day we come here and every day you ask me the same question
many people simply disappear
i UNknown l be waiting for you
when you fall bend your knees
they UNknown e killed your brother
you UNknown e told me already
what are you going to tell him ?
once again he will receive postcards from leningrad
give them to me
nevertheless i must remain here
UNknown say good bye to your uncle and your grandma
we 'r e leaving
children shouldn 't be here
you 'r e going to become a dad
you UNknown e told me already
what name are we going to give it ?
can his name be UNknown ?
then he can be whatever he wants
don 't call your uncle that way
can 't you sleep ?
i need to run away now but i UNknown l come back for you
don 't worry about me
i UNknown l wait here just in case you come back
i must go to a place which i won 't be able to leave for a while
they were beautiful kids
but my neighbor said they just came from UNknown
whenever i had food i 'd give them some
if i didn 't i wouldn 't
food was very expensive back then
they said things would change that the world would be a better place
they left in the middle of the night
we never saw them again
i believed in them
they came and took over 3 UNknown aside from this one
and i really don 't know why they never came back
because they weren 't bad off
they were winning

alexander UNknown sergei UNknown present a film by fyodor UNknown
the year UNknown
but his friendship and love bring them no joy
their people are UNknown control of rays transmitted by towers and mobile units
the invisible rays sap their will and make them believe anything
some people aren 't affected
they 'r e called freaks
when the UNknown are on high the freaks are in unbearable pain
the leaders call themselves the unknown fathers
they are all freaks for whom the rays are weapons of power and torture
the freaks not in power are considered enemies
they are identified persecuted tried and executed in 48 hours
the damn towers !
he 's powerful and physically developed
on 22nd century earth people have learned how to use the hidden resources of the body
meanwhile war is approaching
want to fight ?
they hunt him down
bring him to me
get information on him
they both need him for different reasons
don 't move !
a UNknown for our research
for UNknown ?
maxim plans to destroy the ray transmission system
you idiot !
how many are built every day !
he can 't find allies in the country
the freaks are too weak UNknown scared
ls the real purpose of the towers hidden from the underground ?
most of the conspirators want to take power and use the towers UNknown own purposes
what purposes ?
he decides to find allies beyond the borders among the UNknown and enemies
UNknown lsland the UNknown battle
you jerk listen to me
those aren 't UNknown UNknown towers
they 'r e for people like you
they produce rays that make you believe everything
all that people say
but not me
you 'r e affected by the rays
you don 't notice it
you 'r e a puppet
your passion is from the rays
you see ?
the rays cause them pain
UNknown all of the unknown fathers are freaks
it 's true
what happens in the barracks ?
you passionately sing the anthem ?
passion is in our blood
that passion is UNknown into UNknown skulls !
sing the guard march !
the guards march forth with heavy tread
to take the fort their eyes blood red
what 'r e you give it !
your excellency you requested reports on unusual UNknown in the south
apparently by UNknown
it 's the south after all
what 's unusual ?
UNknown took it
and tell them to bring more of this medicinal stuff
take it easy UNknown
you stole a tank
where else could you be ?
i don 't want to
they respect you
he 's ready to die and wants a real man to replace him
what do you say ?
me a real man ?
i 'm just a puppet
and not the only one there are UNknown million
you UNknown l be okay
half my life as a puppet
and now a homeless bum
perhaps this will decide UNknown
please be seated
i don 't want to
the soldiers are pushing us into the desert
ln 10 15 years we UNknown l be in the desert and die there
without water and food
but he saw that we are weak
then he decided to go to the desert UNknown make a deal with them and lead them against the soldiers
and from us ?
that 's why we have gathered
i don 't get it
he wants barbarians to come ?
they UNknown l kill us all !
i know them !
better not at all
you think i don 't know ?
even the soldiers are better
that 's true of course
but the barbarians might push out the soldiers and leave us
not touch us ?
mak will convince them
i 'm leaving
we don 't need this
let us die in peace
leave us alone
why involve us ?
pity us mak
since when do soldiers pity us ?
my UNknown !
no it 's not for us mak
let things be
really maybe mak can make a deal with the sorcerer
UNknown the tea is good
don 't go to the sorcerer
don 't even think about it
don 't go
did you UNknown children are taken at night ?
but no one enters the houses
kids just sleep walk to him by themselves
or UNknown to stay here
i UNknown l go alone
what can the UNknown you ?
let 's go
you want change
but they didn 't want to change anything
why then ?
who are you to decide UNknown ?
UNknown do you like your new freedom ?
are you happy ?
your conscience is spoiled
means UNknown within ideals
your conscience wishes to UNknown the unknown fathers
UNknown the barbarians so the UNknown die and the blue snake river be filled with bodies
let a huge war begin !
so said your conscience UNknown
i must compromise for such a goal
yes UNknown !
there are forty million beyond the blue snake
they 'r e walking corpses
you are a force maxim
that you are here means the balance of our little world is shattered
but i remind you
try to contact the lsland empire
that is all you wished to know
first i don 't advise you head into the desert
you won 't find anything there
maybe you should follow the sorcerer 's advice and contact the UNknown ?
the lsland empire the white submarine
have you heard of the white submarines ?
and UNknown has too
to the sea
five days away
here to the south border
and don 't forget
you have to pass them
the bomber of his majesty UNknown the first of four gold banners
they would make soldiers recite
private so and so !
name the private bomber of his lmperial majesty !
at first i wanted to evacuate wounded on it but there were too many
and then when all the wounded died
i UNknown l UNknown you
fly away my friends
not like this
my lord !
order me !
i UNknown l throw myself at the guns
where are you enemies ?
what 's wrong with you ?
i want to die foryou
i want to die foryou
to go down in blazes
to go down in blazes
are you nuts ? ldiot !
yes i 'm an idiot !
but i 'm your idiot !
it 's the tower !
UNknown rays !
knock out the towers !
and with heavy tread to take the fort eyes blood red !
drive your machine into that tower
i UNknown l jump with a bomb !
i UNknown l jump !
i won 't miss !
shut up !
i went too far north
i 'm sorry
straighten it !
the lsland empire is too UNknown walk to right ?
what 's the plan ?
let 's walk
lf a patrol catches us say that freaks got me
you chased them and rescued me
what will that give us ?
that 's good
and you either
a patrol wrecked it
well he said weird sailors served on those submarines
weird how ?
captain UNknown says
they 'r e contaminated
so you see then
he was deceived
during the UNknown l had the feeling that i was UNknown a child
you must agree he 's naive
he 's better
did he say he was from the hills ?
tell about his customs ?
how things are there in the hills ?
yes he told me
and no wars
they think the world is the other way around
we don 't live on the inside of the sphere but the outside
and the sphere kind of floats in space
UNknown that 's the world lnside out theory
very interesting indeed
they lied to him
and he believed them
that 's quite true
yes i think so yes
and i think that very soon we UNknown l meet him
you and l
i need to find a common language with him
i hope you UNknown l help me
you will help me won 't you ?
UNknown UNknown second level
i didn 't UNknown
they didn 't give our enemies a chance to get a UNknown in our country
what 's wrong with them ?
you were going to make a deal with them ?
you want to bring them to us mak ?
and stop yelling at me !
you 'r e to blame UNknown !
you destroyed and robbed and turned into beasts
what am i to do with you ?
UNknown let 's go
let 's steal transport !
so we go back to the rays ?
no i mean yes
not good but UNknown it was
why do you need this ?
on the radio they said war has begun
we attacked the UNknown UNknown attacked us
not another war !
calm down !
criminals political and military prisoners
you 'r e in a penal brigade
we need to get in the same brigade
what 's your unit ?
second penal brigade unit four
and then ?
drop your weapon !
don 't shoot !
nice to meet you
brigade two unit four
that 's all on mak 's case
let him know very UNknown
UNknown UNknown 's fate depends on him
do everything so he likes it here
you 'r e free to go
UNknown may i ask one question ?
i 'm afraid of him
he 's a very very dangerous man
i can 't !
which brigade ?
i address you as soldiers
although you 'r e still just the crap of society
thugs and UNknown
the fathers send you into battle
almost all of you will die
and that will be good
but those of you UNknown who survive will life a good life
there 's no way back but there 's a way UNknown
whoever hides will be shot
that one too
column ahead march !
brigade two unit four
herd instinct mak doesn 't rule out personal hope
i UNknown l hide behind a hill
i UNknown l hit the dirt during the attack
but when there 's a battle transmitter behind the hill you lie there
you should have done something !
not hitting towers but telling the truth about the rays !
your whole underground wasn 't worth a damn
i wouldn 't say no to some grub
yeah i 'm hungry
especially before you die
see what they give us
lmperial crap tin cans
how UNknown the border ?
about three kilometers
no river ?
it UNknown l be fine
just listen only to me
don 't listen to anyone else
it 's all lies
where 's mak UNknown ?
no one else !
let 's go !
i can 't go alone
you want to die ?
who are you ?
he 's with you ?
he comes too !
let me die foryou !
i UNknown l die foryou !
let me die foryou !
shut up !
listen to me
yes sir !
great now listen
too bad i didn 't give you to the department
oh well scum
you killed the commander of a special tank brigade
you UNknown l all be killed
lf you want to stay alive i UNknown l get you out
mr maxim does UNknown UNknown 's fate still interest you ?
it 's 6 30 your excellency
you must mr chairman
i hope you are UNknown by the fact that his sister is absolutely safe
like you and your convict friends
am i under arrest ?
not at all you 'r e free
you have an apartment on the UNknown grounds
your own car
all in good time
UNknown UNknown is absolutely safe
you 'r e a civilian not a military man
you 'r e papa
lf your children disobey
why are you silent ?
forgot the quote ?
there 's time
he 's division head in the chemical UNknown lab
your excellency ?
ls UNknown ?
all of them
let 's go
ln physical defense you UNknown e done nothing at all
ln UNknown even less
do you know where he is ?
where does he go ?
i don 't know
the chemical research lab
that 's what military adventures can lead to
this is an inspection
trusted agent of the state with access to the highest state secrets
i propose that you overthrow the unknown fathers
i know where the center is
the center of the tower system
and you are the only person who can seize it
you get in and first of all change the rays to a depression field
people will fall into depression
like lumps of dough
while the entire country is UNknown in depression and the freaks reel UNknown rays you get into the radio station
you broadcast on UNknown cycle this UNknown
it 's all very easy
the unknown fathers are criminals
kill them and you save the country
then you stop the depression field
and you become the head of state
and i stay UNknown as your political and economic advisor
what 's your political program ?
keep in mind that when you seize the center you UNknown l destroy the person who is trying to UNknown you
who controls the fate of UNknown UNknown
that 's right
you must UNknown mak
the crystal swan complex
but while UNknown is alive you won 't get in
last night they took out 90 percent of the UNknown
it 's the end of the war and the end for many of us
what do you think genius ?
by the way what do you think of our savage ?
fine we UNknown l talk about mak later
i UNknown l go in
you wait 20 minutes
lf not there 's a UNknown bomb in the trunk
put the bomb on the street
turn it on and drive away
there will be panic
mak let me make some calls
call headquarters ?
when i go in the building
not a moment before
that 's it
get him !
mak who is this ?
you are UNknown UNknown UNknown boar
and you are professor UNknown UNknown
go and work !
UNknown let 's get to headquarters while we can
what did you use ?
tell me who you are !
who i am ?
to prepare this poor little planet for salvation in keeping with their UNknown
who are you ?
who are you ?
'd UNknown 't know ! ldiot !
what should we do now ?
we 'r e too late
they 'r e here
i didn 't catch you
do you know what to do ?
they UNknown l see they were lied to
and rise up
where will they rise to ?
what were you thinking ?
the unknown fathers are alive and well
the guards are intact
but the center is gone !
no more rays !
i forgot them !
you stupid kid did you know the lsland empire is about to attack ?
they 'r e sending an armada
get out of here
but you ?
how could you do all this ?
war towers battles tanks UNknown !
how could you ?
it 's their world their history
we can 't change anything
why not ?
go home you UNknown nose kid
i am home !
i UNknown l fight inflation if i have to
as long as i 'm alive as long as i 'm alive you hear me ?
i won 't let anyone build another center
and i will never regret it
you have to make good from evil
there 's nothing else to make it from
directed by fyodor UNknown
screenplay eduard UNknown
composer yuri UNknown
sound UNknown UNknown
looks worse than it is
why does it keep happening to you ?
what 's that supposed to mean ?
it was a UNknown week too
yes a door !
it happens to us active types
UNknown tag is crooked
i 'm building a tool shed of UNknown and i trip in the hood of my UNknown that i had taken off for lunch
then i smacked my head on the concrete base of the parasol
i thought that maybe you had some lotion
maybe some really great new stuff ?
l UNknown l have a look
it goes 3 5 9
that 's how it 's always been done
no reason to change it
otherwise apply for art school
it 's just rolls
UNknown on time
6 a m
she had a seizure again
and the doctors were late
so that 's your excuse ?
UNknown it 's not really an excuse
anna anna anna
some have to visit family in UNknown others transfer in norway and some are just eager to get home
sorry but i would be a lousy manager if i didn 't dismiss you
so you 'r e fired
i hurried as much as i could
i even took a cab to get here
now you leave me no choice
pack up your locker and leave
i don 't have a locker
you can 't eat another person 's buffet fries
then you have to pay UNknown
give it a rest
she says she 's not very hungry
i specifically UNknown that the shrimp sandwich was UNknown UNknown
i gave her a chance but she chose to ignore it
yes maybe it 's funny but you UNknown l be charged for two buffet meals
otherwise i UNknown l call the police
you want that ?
the swedish police
no why should there be a problem ?
you know i don 't want to pry
UNknown lines will help you if you have any problems
i 'm really glad to UNknown eric
but i have no problems what so ever
UNknown UNknown like everyone else
but nothing i would bother the management with
you can 't call the police like that
you scare off the customers
they broke the buffet rule eric
it was a couple of fries
but where do we draw the line ?
definitely not there
i did !
she then proceeds to dive into the paying guest 's buffet meal
why did you fire her ?
anna ? !
she stole things too
but that 's my fault entirely
i 'm so naive
is that all ?
an eight hour
around the area before you sleep
you should join me UNknown
i don 't think so
sure you won 't come ?
no i have to go home
have a nice evening
i have to close up now
they don 't have a mimi
they don 't have a mimi ? !
what about my tickets then ?
i bought tickets for nine shows
how should i know
they can 't just cancel
what else could they do ?
they shouldn 't announce it without a mimi
change your tickets and wait for opening night
where have you been ?
focus please !
did you check UNknown couch ?
that 's right
calm down mama bear
did i scare you ?
yes one gets like
right mama b
i found the sheep bente
UNknown of UNknown UNknown ran into the street
flying through the air
look at your nose
then we will just have to find the guy on the UNknown
i 'm going to be frank with you and i want a straight answer
excuse me ?
no no no
no of course not
it 's a vast emotional sea but that 's marriage foryou
i wouldn 't interfere but this affects your work
it can 't go on like this
how often does she beat you ?
when she 's drunk or ?
no bente is not a drinker
is that all ?
now you 'r e UNknown your boundaries eric
i don 't think you 'r e in your right
listen to me !
seek help or i UNknown l let you go
and i will let you go
what kind of help ?
i 'm not UNknown
you what ?
and benjamin UNknown ?
please start alf
i 'm a mechanic too
UNknown share a garage
are you a mechanic ?
here 's my card
UNknown you care to start alf ?
i was with tina for two years
and i started to poke her a bit after a couple of days
we 'r e not together anymore
but i UNknown e beat up other girls too
it 's like after two weeks i 'm
i was her senior by two years
it 's a long time ago
UNknown didn 't marry until UNknown when UNknown died
she was so different back then
UNknown were both singers then
when did you start striking your wife ?
i don 't know
i saw a UNknown today
any salt left ?
they have this arrangement
for their mentally ill members sure
UNknown 'r e employees
and you feel you have the time for that ?
cause i could really use some help around the house
keeping house is no small matter
so you saw a UNknown today
pass the potatoes
the fork should let go jan
let 's sum things up
it sounds like you feel inferior to bente
she works all the time while you stay at home sewing curtains
i don 't get it
jan has a job
a bente who is sick and tired of you lying around on the couch
an annoyed bente who had a rough day on the ferry
bente doesn 't love you anymore
she loved the jan you used to be
the jan from school
the jan with the meaningful job
but jan does have a job !
rudy we 'r e on the verge of a breakthrough
the jan and the bente who once vowed to stay UNknown are no more
they are gone
is bente working on the ferry now ?
one more word and you 'r e gone !
let 's see
and that 's why i hit her
you nailed it !
i know that i should get a job get out of the house and seek help
damn it !
bye rudy !
what should i do ?
you should have left yourself long ago
me too !
remember rome ?
the UNknown du UNknown is actually in paris
it matters to me
don 't you think ?
and the black rose you gave me for my birthday with a little note that said
to mama bear
technically black is not a color
to me it is
yes but bente
and i love you jan
it because i 'm too fat ?
no you 'r e not fat
you 'r e not too fat or too skinny
you 'r e just right
you can 't call us every time
it won 't happen again
my sincere apologies ladies
i know and i do apologize
it 's a severe health violation
things don 't change overnight
there is no time
those days are over
you scare off the customers
it would benefit everyone if you left bente
i 'm in group therapy
you told me to seek help
and i 'm getting it
it 's not helping
i 'm doing this for your sake !
if i stuck to the rules i 'd have fired you long ago
i really want to stay on eric
please give me more time to make progress in the group
i need more time
i get more and more paranoid the more she says she loves me
and then i just lose it
don 't you see it 's UNknown get a hooker ?
UNknown doesn 't care if you say i love you or i UNknown l punch you
of course it 's extra to beat her up
not everywhere no
shut the fuck up rudy !
you know what i mean right ?
yes i think i do
once a swedish writer said UNknown
all UNknown are female that 's why we have UNknown
one more word and we stop !
you admit that you have commitment issues because you know you have a dark side
i don 't have a dark side
it 's perfectly normal
it 's natural for you to want to beat the shit out UNknown
how can that be normal ?
wake the fuck up UNknown !
if UNknown is banging the hell out of some old sweaty bastard then it 's normal for you to want to crack her head open with a hammer
but to act on it is wrong
put distance between the heart and the hand
egyptians thought with their hearts
that 's it !
read your history
tell him it 's with interest
i don 't know
so what 's with you ?
go home and get the wife to blow you
you bet !
but you wanted a coke
rudy is at the UNknown machine
what 's with you ?
it 's just a figure of speech
is he the guy that fired you anna ?
what 's wrong with you ?
her mom is sick damn it !
please step over here
is he UNknown you ?
no no it 's just
oh my god !
yup i nailed him good
you wanna grab his wallet ?
did you bring someone here ?
did you bring a woman into our house ?
bente when would i do that ?
are you sneaking your mistresses in the back door ?
you never did jan
i promise to forgive you
UNknown all make mistakes jan
come clean jan
just get it out there and we can move on
you 'r e leaving me
i know it
you 'r e going to leave me for someone else
do you understand ?
you 'r e never seeing that psycho shrink again !
here we go
UNknown have four paint jobs by friday
feel welcome to ask
my uncle sent his wife over a cliff
that 's not it
you have to give it serious thought
killing someone is a big deal
eight years behind bars if they nail you
she is cheating on me
wlth UNknown ?
un fucking believable !
and last year
it ends right here jan !
9 10 11 12 13 14 500
we UNknown l bill you for an exhaust pipe so there won 't be any you know
then you bury her behind the opera house ?
sure in the forest behind it
UNknown UNknown we went there often
bente and i when we were young
bente always wanted to sing there one day
it 's her big dream
it 's a nice place
don 't you think ?
get a one day round trip
are you taking the bridge ?
that might be good
if you can avoid it
there 's no time
you wanna call the cops ?
what ? !
he won 't pay for it
are you alright ?
damn it bente you
huh ? !
this is rudy and alf
the mechanics who came to look at the car
bente you 'r e singing
no i 'm not
they love opera
UNknown you know everything 's going as planned
she opens the door and it wasn 't as easy as we thought
right alf ?
it wasn 't supposed to be easy
now what ?
it 's complicated
it 's the nose and the eyes
and her mouth
it 's a big mess in there
i have to talk to UNknown about it
UNknown can 't do it
i loved my mom
and my dad beat her up and left her
see how that stirs things up ?
no i don 't
talk is for old folks
i have UNknown to do than stand here with two mommy sick babies ?
you 'r e not going in
UNknown 'r e cooking a UNknown
you UNknown e been outside ? !
yes we all went to the supermarket
alf is a member so he gets 4 off
yes i get this check once a year
they call it the dividend
UNknown don 't give a rat 's ass
you think the meat is UNknown out ?
just one more song bente
i don 't think that 's such a good idea
no because there 's no singing in this house
UNknown have an opera rule
right bente ?
so let 's not break it
hold it jan
rudy let 's go into the kitchen
you just sing if you want to
you have a great wife jan
leave now alf
and rudy is not making a UNknown
don 't ever fucking threaten me
and you better lay off hitting bente
you 'r e a sick bastard if you slap her
you lay a finger on her and you die
got it ?
do i make myself clear ?
UNknown sang a lot back then
UNknown the head of the opera said
i was one ofhis most promising pupils
the opera house in sweden ?
jan had a pretty good voice too
you did !
i had cooked pasta for us
i had forgotten to turn off the gas
jan came into the kitchen with a lit cigarette
you chain smoked then
the UNknown in jan 's ears began
and it was all my fault
can 't you hear anything ?
no not at all
because of the opera rule
hold it right there bente
what with the opera rule ?
jan was devastated by his loss
and it was kind of implied that if jan couldn 't sing none of us should
that 's not entirely true bente
you dragged me down with you
at least i moved on
i got a job to put food on the table and pay the rent
bente on the other hand chose to get a depression
she just quit the academy
because you told me to !
you said we were through if i sang
that it was too painful
so i chose to stay with you i chose not to pursue my calling
i thought you were my calling
i thought our love came first
but i guess i was wrong
cause the minute i left the academy
jan rose in the ranks of the ferry empire
suddenly there was no time for me
no loving remark no loving look
no nice blouse
you took opera away from me and gave me nothing in return
i could have been somebody jan but you didn 't care as long as you had your ferry
your oh so precious ferry !
you see what i 'm up against every day ?
and with this cold hearted prick
shame on you jan
i think you should leave the table
take UNknown attitude and leave
where should i go ?
take your ringing and go to your room
just a touch
sorry about calling this early
let me sweetheart
who did you speak too ?
what about the opera rule then ?
then nothing matters

to be UNknown by what court ?
i said what i UNknown l do
that 's our contract
the standard ss rate for jewish skilled UNknown is seven marks a day five for UNknown and women
this is what you pay the reich economic office
the jews themselves receive nothing
poles you pay wages
are you listening ?
the rate ?
he gets nothing
it 's less ?
poles cost more
an UNknown factory over at UNknown street
it uh it um
but it 's outside the ghetto so you can barter for extra goods for eggs i don 't know what you need with the polish workers
you can 't get it here
also he 's asking for ten healthy women for the

like what ?
your name goes on a list
your name is on the list they put you on trucks
no no no that 's not true
you 'r e a musician ?
i 'm not going to hide like some animal
there are places to hide

all this stuff here goes to UNknown 's factory on tuesday of next week
my father was fond of saying you need three things in life
a good doctor a forgiving priest
and a clever accountant
but the third !
is that all ?
i 'm saying i couldn 't have done this without you
the usual thing would be to acknowledge my gratitude
it would also by the way be the courteous thing
you 'r e welcome
it doesn 't work that way
you UNknown e done well here
you look wonderful
mrs schindler marek
the clothes the car the apartment
wait a minute
i UNknown e got 350
350 workers on the factory floor with one purpose
to make pots and pans ?
to make money
back home ?
oskar schindler they UNknown l say
everybody remembers him
he came here with nothing a suitcase
and built a bankrupt company into a major UNknown
and left with a steamer trunk
two steamer trunks full of money
all the riches of the world
it 's comforting to see that nothing 's changed
you 'r e wrong UNknown
there 's no way i could have known this before but there was always something missing
in every business i tried i can see now it wasn 't me that failed
something was missing
and it makes all the difference in the world between success and failure
i asked you if i should stay
it 's up to you
promise me oskar
we 'r e doing well ?
the war could end
every day he comes
mr UNknown !
you 'r e welcome
the ss beat me up
they would have killed me but i am essential to the war effort thanks to you
that 's great
i 'm sure you do
i UNknown l continue to work hard for you
that 's great
he saved my life
this is for the major sir
and this is for his niece greta
it 's her birthday
did he ?
you shouldn 't think of them as yours oskar
you need to understand that some of the officers here don 't give a damn about production
to them it 's a matter of um national priority that jews be made to shovel snow
essential worker ?
essential worker for oskar schindler
a one armed jew ?
twice as useless !
look at the snow
i lost a worker
file a UNknown with the economic office
it 's your right
of course not !
he was a metal press operator
stern is that you ?
no it 's UNknown
he is ?
i 'm sorry
he 's on the list
if he were an essential worker he would not be on the list
i 'm talking to a clerk
what is your name ?
sir the list is correct
i didn 't ask you about the list
i asked you your name
my plant manager is somewhere on this train
if it leaves with him on it it UNknown l disrupt production and the UNknown board will want to know why
is he on the list ?
there is nothing i can do
what is your name ?
close and secure all doors
my name ?
and what 's yours ?
gentlemen thank you very much
i think i can guarantee you you UNknown l both be in southern russia before the end of the month
this one that one
it 's the paperwork
i tried to explain them it was a mistake but
what if i got here five minutes later ?
then where would i be ?
i woke up from a dream this morning
i have to laugh
the walls i can deal with
it 's the restrictions to my life i 'm tired of
those walls keep them out
that 's all i care about
i like it here
you are a slave to these people
no one UNknown us any more
i 'm smart !
you 'r e a real genius
you had your chance
i can 't remember the last time i did that
when 's the last time we did this ?
when 's the last time we stood around and talked ?
no one ordered me onto a truck today
no one took my business away from me
you don 't really have a business to take
there 's nowhere down from here
this is it
this street UNknown the ghetto just about in half

we are not going to have arguments with these people
it will take more than that
i 'm sure you are right !

like she said
today is history and you are part of it
six hundred years ago UNknown the great so called told the jews they could come to UNknown
yes a bit less
come on quicker !
all right ?
no no !
the right side ?

the bullet passed me by so close !
you 'r e crazy !
you can join her or join the line
women to the left !

what are you talking about ?
we tried it before
i changed my mind !
now look at me
mama i 'm coming out !

i 'm saying a blessing for you
let 's go please !
come on !
what is it ?
no way !
i wish this fucking night were over
no no no
good to see you my friend
i was explaining to herr UNknown and herr UNknown some of the benefits of moving their factories into UNknown
i meant the food
you can work them all night if you want
your factory policies whatever they UNknown e been in the past they UNknown l continue to be
they UNknown l be respected
i have to know where do you get a suit like that ?
what is that ?
i don 't know
they 'r e here
every day that goes by i 'm losing money
every worker that is shot costs me money
i have to find somebody else
i have to trade them !
we are going to be making so much money that none of this is going to matter
it 's bad business
that it 's not some vague thing with you like it is with others
you want to stay where you are
you UNknown e got things going on the side
things are good
i can understand all that you know ?
i know you
do you have any idea what is involved ?
the paperwork alone ?
getting the fucking permits is enough to drive you crazy
i UNknown e been through it
you could make things easier for me
i 'd be grateful
he wants his independence
but independence costs money
helps make them keep their distance
do you have lice ?
do you have your notebook ?
the calendar on my desk has the birthdays of our ss friends wives and children
don 't forget to send something
record pay UNknown to the main administration and economics office the UNknown
slowly stern slowly
dealings with our black market contacts listed as UNknown
in the legitimate ledger are more complicated
forget it !
it gives me a headache !
i couldn 't get you out of here
i UNknown l be all right
anyway i 'm here almost every week
here put these in your pocket
come on !
i UNknown e worked too hard
hinges sir !
where are they from again ?
UNknown mr commander !
make me a UNknown
says he 's doing well
oh that 's very good
but i 'm a bit confused and perhaps you can help me
what i don 't understand is that you UNknown e been working since i think what about 6 00 this morning ?
yet such a small pile of hinges
check the angle lever
maybe the pin shaft is greasy
yeah come on
i was put on to UNknown coal
strange huh ?
squad leader !
mr director !
why the long story ?
thank you sir
nobody knows who stole the chicken ?
tell him about the chicken
a man walks around with a chicken and nobody notices this
you 'r e welcome again
it 's an honour to work for such a great company
it 's great to have you !
i promise to learn everything there 's to know about UNknown production
that 's great !
i only need five minutes
she wants to speak to mr director
please sit down
they say that no one dies here
they say your factory is a haven
they say you are good
who says that ?
i UNknown e been living in UNknown on false papers since the ghetto massacre
my parents are in UNknown
their names are UNknown and UNknown UNknown
they are older people
they bury them up in the forest
look i don 't have any money
i i borrowed these clothes
i 'm begging you
i don 't do that
you UNknown e been misled
i ask one thing
my father is an UNknown not a UNknown
such activities are illegal
cry and i will have you arrested
i swear to god !
he wants to kill everybody ?
bring everybody over ?
send them over to schindler
send them all !
it 's not a factory
it 's not an enterprise of any kind
it 's a haven for UNknown and orphans and people with no skills whatsoever !
you think i don 't know what you 'r e doing ?
you 'r e so quiet all the time
i know i know !
are you losing money ?
that 's not the point !
what other point is
you have to understand
you have to think of it in his situation
he 's got this whole place to run
he 's responsible for everything here all these people
he 's got a lot of things to worry about
and he 's got the war which brings out the worst in people
never the good always the bad
always the bad
he 'd be all right
there 'd just be the good aspects of him which
he 's a wonderful crook
a man who loves good food good wine the ladies making money
UNknown told me the other day somebody escaped from a work detail outside the wire
UNknown lined up everybody from the missing man 's barracks
he shot the man to the left of UNknown the man to the right of him
he walked down the line shooting every other man with a pistol
twenty five !
have goldberg bring them over
mr director i was just helping UNknown to find something to clean the stains from the commander 's bathtub
go clean it
you know who i am ?
i 'm schindler
here why don 't you keep this someplace ?
go on take it
well if you don 't want to eat it trade it
or give it to UNknown
why not build yourself up ?
my first day here he beat me because i threw out the bones from dinner
he came down to the basement at midnight and he he asked me where they were
for his dogs you understand ?
i said to him i i don 't know how i say this
i never could say it now i said to him why are you beating me ?
he said the reason i beat you now is because you ask why i beat you
i know your sufferings helen
it doesn 't matter
no no no no he won 't shoot you
through the throat
she was no fatter or thinner or slower or faster than anyone else and i couldn 't guess what had she done
the more you see of the commander the more you see there is no set rules that you can live by
you can 't say to yourself if i follow these rules i will be safe
he won 't shoot you because he enjoys you too much
he enjoys you so much he won 't even let you wear the star
he doesn 't want anyone else to know it 's a jew he 's enjoying
he shot the woman from the steps because she meant nothing to him
she was one of a series neither offending or pleasing him
but you helen !
thank you !
i send you good stuff all the time
your liver 's going to explode like a hand grenade
you know i look at you i watch you !
you 'r e never drunk
oh that 's that 's real control
control is power
we have the fucking power to kill that 's why they fear us
they fear us because we have the power to kill UNknown
a man commits a crime he should know better
we have him killed and we feel pretty good about it
or we kill him ourselves and we feel even better
that 's not power though
that 's justice
power is when we have every justification to kill and we don 't
you think that 's power ?
that 's what the UNknown had
a man stole something he 's brought in before the emperor he throws himself down on the ground he begs for mercy
he knows he 's going to die
and the emperor pardons him
this worthless man
that 's power amon
i don 't know but they 'r e in my office right now UNknown our books
as my accountant tell me should i be alarmed that the UNknown are UNknown my books ?
or have you done your job properly ?
you needn 't be alarmed
i needn 't be alarmed !
i 'm sorry sir
do you know how much it costs ?
all right !
tell her not to do it again
i have to report sir i UNknown e been unable to remove the stains from your bathtub
what are you using UNknown ?
leave i pardon you
so this is where you come to hide from me
i came to tell you that you um you really are a wonderful cook and a well trained servant
i mean it
it must get lonely down here when you 'r e listening to everyone upstairs having such a good time
does it ?
that 's what you 'r e thinking
what does he want to hear ?
the truth helen is always the right answer
yes you 'r e right
sometimes we 'r e both lonely
wh what would that be like i wonder ?
i mean what would be wrong with that ?
i realize that you 'r e not a a person in the the strictest sense of the word but
no maybe you 'r e right about that too you know maybe what 's what 's wrong isn 't it 's not us !
it 's no it 's this !
i mean when they compare you to to uh vermin and to UNknown and to lice i just uh
no no you you make a good point
you make a very good point
is this the face of a rat ?
are these the eyes of a rat ?
hath not a jew eyes ?
i feel for you helen
no i don 't think so
you 'r e a jewish bitch !
you nearly talked me into it didn 't you ?
i i wish for you a happy birthday
happy birthday !
thank you very much
the trains arrived and the people were driven out with clubs
they were lined up in front of two big warehouses
one was marked cloak room and the other valuables
and there they were made to undress
a jewish boy handed them pieces of string to tie their shoes together
they shaved their hair
and then they were herded down a big corridor to UNknown with stars of david on the doors and signs that said bath and UNknown room
ss gave them soap
and then they gassed them
UNknown why UNknown ?
come on UNknown stop it
your bedtime stories are scaring everyone
i just don 't believe it
i don 't believe it either
i cannot believe it
i said i heard it
from who ?
you know if they were there they would have been gassed
we 'r e their UNknown
what sense does it make to kill your own UNknown ?
to go to all this trouble of UNknown a UNknown only to
no it can 't be true
we are very very important for them
yes we do now !
everyone who is alive
there is going to be a selection
and you UNknown e got to cut down on the cognac
it 's another UNknown annual physical
what are they this time ?
look alive UNknown
no no no !
those who can work and those who can 't
she can work
go back to the barracks
return to the barracks
go back to your barracks !
i didn 't see him !
they 'r e hiding
i know UNknown
she took all of them together
there 's no room for you here
go away quick !
i tried to call you
here UNknown move
it 's taking longer than i thought
a drink ?
we can start !
where 's the fire ?
that 's it that 's it
more more !
you are giving them hope
you shouldn 't do that
that 's cruel !
look out !
i have 20 metres at home in my garden
we can reach the cars at the end
on the roof on the other side
you should be aware of that
we will have to risk regret
all right sure
i UNknown l go for a drive with you
what about you ?
though i doubt anyone can point out the actual provision to me
i kissed a jewish girl
did your prick fall off ?
he sees a beautiful woman he doesn 't think
i mean he has so many women
and they love him
all right no
but you didn 't see this girl
i saw this girl
they cast a spell on you you know the jews
when you work closely with them like i do you see this
they have this power
some of my men are infected with this virus
they should be pitied not punished
they should receive treatment
i see this all the time
it 's a matter of money ?
you 'r e offering me a bribe ?
a bribe ?
you should kiss us not them
god forbid you ever get a real taste for jewish skirt
there 's no future in it
they don 't have a future
that 's not just good old fashioned jew hating talk
it 's policy now
you can do it with your hands quick !
come here !
i have to find every rag buried up here and burn it
the party 's over oskar
they 'r e closing us down sending everybody to auschwitz
maybe 30 40 days
i UNknown e been talking to UNknown
i know the destination
i 'm to help organize the UNknown put myself on the last train
that 's not what i was going to say
i made UNknown promise me he UNknown l put in a good word for you
nothing bad is going to happen to you there
you UNknown l receive special treatment
the UNknown coming in from berlin mention
special treatment more and more often
i 'd like to think that 's not what you mean
UNknown treatment alright ?
i think so
in UNknown ?
what for ?
of course you UNknown l have to hire new workers
poles i guess
what are you going to do ?
you ran my business
i UNknown e done what i came here for
i UNknown e got more money than any man can spend in a lifetime
some day this is all going to end you know
i was going to say we UNknown l have a drink then
i think i better have it now
i don 't understand
these people ?
who are you moses ?
come on what is this ?
where 's the money in this ?
where 's the scam ?
it 's good business
look you UNknown e got to move them the equipment everything to czechoslovakia
pay for all that and build another camp
doesn 't make any sense
look amon it 's good for me
you 'r e not telling me something
i know them
i don 't have to train them
you 'r e not telling me something
it 's good for you
i UNknown l compensate you
that 's right
you know what i 'm going to make ?
tank shells they need that
tanks shells yeah !
you 'r e probably UNknown me somehow
if i 'm making a hundred you UNknown e got to be making three
and if you admit to making three then it 's four actually
but how ?
yeah all right don 't tell me
i UNknown l go along with it
it 's just irritating i can 't work it out
look all you have to do is tell me what it 's worth to you
what 's a person worth to you ?
no no no no
UNknown UNknown UNknown UNknown and uh uh UNknown UNknown
you might even make money at it
i don 't know
paid for out of your own pocket
if we make a combined approach we could get more than 4 000 out mine and yours
i don 't know
too many !
i UNknown e done all i can
i will not accept that
no oskar i can 't do any more
i will not accept that
you just told him how many people you needed and
you 'r e not buying them ?
you 'r e buying them ?
you 'r e paying him for each of these names ?
if you were still working for me i 'd expect you to talk me out of it
it 's costing me a fortune
finish the page and leave one space at the bottom
the list is life
oskar there 's a clerical error here at the bottom of the last page
no there 's one more name i want to put there
i UNknown l never find a maid as well trained as her at UNknown
they are all country girls
i can 't wager helen in a card game
why not ?
what difference does it make ?
she 's not going to auschwitz
i 'd never do that to her
no i want her to come back to vienna with me
i want her to come to work for me there
i want to grow old with her
are you mad ?
no of course i can 't
that 's what i 'd like to do
what i can do if i 'm any sort of a man is the next most merciful thing
i shall take her into the woods and shoot her UNknown in the back of the head
what was it you said for a natural 21 ?
was it 14 800 ?
UNknown jonas UNknown and UNknown
we are UNknown
UNknown get another one !
UNknown under my command was the envy of every other commandant in the labour camp system
the prisoners however
the train with the women has already left UNknown and will be arriving here very shortly
i know you UNknown e had a long journey
but it 's only a short walk further to the factory where hot soup and bread is waiting for you
welcome to UNknown !
i don 't like beans
beans and meat and potatoes and bread
that 's not the way you make UNknown
eggs in UNknown ?
no you don 't
i like caviar !
oh yes !
you UNknown e got to stay together
leave the wagons !
where are the tables ?
17 18 20 they 'r e in auschwitz
the train was never UNknown here
a paperwork mistake
hands on the shoulders !
don 't kill yourself against the fence clara
if you do you UNknown l never know what happened to you
how old are you mother ?
sixty six sir
we are not supposed to be here
we work for oskar schindler
we are schindler jews
he had a factory in UNknown
you are not the only industrialist who needs labour mr schindler
i remember earlier this year UNknown color ordered a UNknown of UNknown for its chemical factory
the train came in through the UNknown and the officer in charge of the selection went immediately to work and sent 2 000 of them straight away to special treatment
it is not my task to interfere with the UNknown that take place down here
why do you think i can help you if i can 't help UNknown color ?
allow me to express the reason
i 'm not making any judgement about you
it 's just that i know that in the coming months we 'r e all going to need portable wealth
i could have you arrested
i 'm protected by powerful friends
you should know that
all i say is i 'm not comfortable with them on the table
i have a shipment coming in tomorrow
i UNknown l cut you 300 units from it
yes yes yes !
that 's right
UNknown UNknown !
these are mine !
they should be on my train !
they 'r e skilled munitions workers !
they 'r e essential !
essential girls !
how else am i to polish the inside of a 45 UNknown shell casing ?
you tell me
back on the train !
under department w provisions it is unlawful to kill a worker without just cause
under the businesses compensation fund i am entitled to file damage claims for such deaths
if you shoot without thinking you go to prison i get paid
that 's how it works
so there will be no summary executions here
there will be no interference of any kind with production
in hopes of UNknown that guards will no longer be allowed on the factory floor without my authorization
for your cooperation you have my gratitude
come on come !
no doorman or UNknown d will ever mistake you again i promise
this is UNknown stern my accountant
you must be mrs schindler
it 's a pleasure to meet you
UNknown has volunteered to work in the clinic
very generous of you
this is my wife stern
i don 't keep any secrets from my spouse
oskar please attend to business
it 's much more attractive
the artillery shells tank shells rocket UNknown !
apparently all of them have failed quality control tests
that 's to be expected !
start up problems
this is a precise business
i UNknown l write them a letter
they 'r e withholding payment
sure so would i so would you
i wouldn 't worry
there 's a rumour you UNknown e been going around UNknown the machines
they could shut us down send us back to auschwitz
i UNknown l call around find out where we can buy shells
pass them off as ours
i don 't see the difference whether they 'r e made here or somewhere else
you don 't see a difference ?
i see a difference
fewer shells will be made
stern if this factory ever produces a shell that can actually be fired i UNknown l be very unhappy
how are you doing rabbi ?
is it ?
you should be preparing for the sabbath
shouldn 't you ?
in my office
the unconditional surrender of germany has just been announced
at midnight tonight the war is over
tomorrow you UNknown l begin the process of looking for survivors of your families
in most cases you won 't find them
after six long years of murder victims are being UNknown throughout the world
we UNknown e survived
i 'm a member of the nazi party
i 'm a munitions manufacturer
i 'm a UNknown of slave labour
i am a criminal
i shall remain with you until five minutes after midnight after which time and i hope you UNknown l forgive me i have to flee
i know you have received orders from our commandant which he has received from his superiors to dispose of the population of this camp
now would be the time to do it
here they are they 'r e all here
this is your opportunity
in memory of the countless victims among your people i ask us to observe three minutes of silence
thank you mr UNknown
as soon as peace occurs i want um i want that cloth distributed to the workers
two and a half metres each
also each person is to get a bottle of vodka
they won 't drink it
they know its value
it UNknown l be done
everything you ask
every worker has signed it
thank you !
i could have got more out
i could have got more
i don 't know
oskar there are 1 100 people who are alive because of you
look at them
i threw away so much money
you have no idea
i didn 't do enough
you did so much
why did i keep the car ?
ten people right there
he would have given me one one more
one more person
i could have gotten one more person and i didn 't
and i i didn 't !
you have been liberated by the soviet army !
have you been in poland ?
i just came from poland
are there any jews left ?
where should we go ?
don 't go east that 's for sure
they hate you there
we could use some food
isn 't there a town over there ?
now or never
he 's over there
very much so
you look beautiful
we UNknown e never actually manage to keep anything simple
you can try
family and friends we gather here
to celebrate the union between michael UNknown and sara UNknown
sorry to break up the party
what the hell 's going on ?
we have an arrest warrant
we settle this with the feds weeks ago !
sir back up !
we 'r e here for her
she didn 't do anything
she wasn 't involved
sara UNknown you 'r e under arrest for the murder of christina hampton
they UNknown l not gonna let me see her
why did kellerman send you if you can 't do anything ?
they 'r e trying to break both of you
look she has constitutional right to reasonable UNknown
i UNknown l draw up an order to show cause and get it before the judge immediately
what do you argue in ?
do you argue in self defence ?
security camera only shows sara stepping up and firing at the victim
and because she was so good at hiding her true identity we can 't prove otherwise
look you all get UNknown did not set well with law enforcement
if they can make sara pay for it they will
how much time is she looking at ?
25 to life
i don 't think so
i haven 't been convicted of anything yet
i 'm supposed to be in a jail
this is prison
this is the jail
you need some help ?
you UNknown e got everything you need over there ?
they just like to intimidate
they are good at it
you can ride it out to your court date there
i remember your pretty face from the papers
you are not going anywhere fish
this is going to happen
half a dozen guards lost their jobs and UNknown at fox river
another dozen were put on probation after you decided to leave the door open for your boyfriend and his seven convict pals
and we ain 't gonna let anything like that happen again
don 't worry we won 't hit the baby basket
looked like that welcome wagon ran over your face
it looks that way huh ?
everybody calls me daddy
i told you
you tellin me you can 't get your hands on the cash ?
unless that 's the least you can do
considering you 'r e gonna kill me not too long ago
one of our friends has been apprehended by the authorities
i know that
i want her
a capital you no longer have
my rainy day plan
it 's good money at the bad joe
they 'r e not gonna let me out of here
no matter how many shots that i have
you 'r e much braver than i gave you credit for
either that or you 'r e amazingly nice
do i look like i wanna talk to you ?
i just say a woman in your position laid up for some protection
join the prison gang ?
i don 't think so
not a gang
that 's her wife
are you okay ?
i need the infirmary
i 'm having muscle UNknown on my throat
and my jaws UNknown up
it 's just it 's just could be UNknown i 'm not poisoned
if i don 't get to the hospital in the next 15 minutes
i will die and my baby will die
we were able to administer the charcoal ???
you and your baby are gonna be okay
you know the ??? didn 't get into my UNknown all by itself right ?
well then you need to talk to the warden about it
then how about talking to me about your face ?
you want to tell me how that happened ?
i caught an elbow playing basketball
we should discuss your situation
as i 'm sure you UNknown e UNknown this isn 't going to be a run of the mill pregnancy
can i deliver in here ?
we UNknown l take you to st lucia down the road
we UNknown l UNknown off a room
there UNknown l be 3 armed guards in there with me when you give birth
do i get to see my baby ?
you UNknown l have 30 minutes before we take it away
i UNknown e seen this process a dozen times
after the mothers come back here the depression 's almost unbearable
my advice it 's a lot less messy if you 'd just think of yourself as a UNknown
someone tried to poison her
what are you talking about ?
michael i need you to focus
your name will be at the bottom somewhere below
jesus christ and UNknown doo
someone tried to poison sara today
sara is with child ?
i am asking you father to father to leave her alone
you can kill me if you want to kill me
i UNknown l trade my life for hers
but leave sara alone
if sara were killed your pain will last the rest of your life
now that 's got to be appealing to whoever who put out this hit
but don 't worry michael
if i find out anything i UNknown l be sure to let you know
i don 't think you understand
she 's not safe here !
if i grant her a transfer everybody 's gonna want one
what about UNknown housing ?
is there something that i should know about the UNknown integrity of shoe ?
i can see where this is going
i know who you are
and i 'm not going to let you turn my prison into the next fox river
all i 'm trying to do is keep my wife alive
you do know she 's pregnant
i don 't care
sara UNknown is not getting any UNknown treatment
and you UNknown e made yourself perfectly clear
thank you for your time
what happened ?
and the warden 's just gonna let that happen
we gotta lure in her case and needs to get her out right ?
which is not enough time
if she stays in that prison someone 's going to kill her
i guess we don 't have a choice
we 'r e breaking her out
alexander UNknown is the smartest bravest most honorable man i UNknown e ever had the pleasure of serving with
as one of those 43 agents i can 't help but feel a bit offended
because obviously i am not as honoured as this drive addicted murderer
alex has been clean and sober for four months
and he 's been completely UNknown of all crimes associated with his involvement with the company
that doesn 't include the shooting and the murder of one oscar UNknown
and burying his body under his bird bath that is just an UNknown
let 's move on shall we ?
all those in favor of UNknown alexander UNknown a special agent in the federal bureau of investigation
thank you for the invite richard
it 's always a pleasure
you know alex
if you 'r e able to sufficiently demonstrate just how committed you are to a life of service
now as you may know sara UNknown was arrested recently and is currently being house at the miami UNknown state penitentiary
we have concerns that michael UNknown may have other plans for her
so this this is why you 'r e invite me in here
well obviously if UNknown were to be able to pull off this plot of another UNknown the public UNknown will be UNknown to the bureau
so having someone to get us a UNknown information that would be worth something to us
agent UNknown is set up in miami
he will be your contact
you 'r e something else
give me a reason to give it to you
what 's your plan after we break her out ?
we 'r e on the run again ?
first thing first
look if you 'r e worried about getting into trouble again go back to chicago go back to your family
i UNknown l understand
after all the crap we UNknown e been through i 'm just going to leave you here and sara in there ?
you shut up and don 't bring it up again
what 's all that ?
none of them
well the prison officials learned a lot
they re UNknown they UNknown
the prison 's UNknown escape proof
are you alright ?
like down into the prison ?
we we parachute in
i 'm serious that 's suicide !
newspapers clippings only going to get us so far
we need some more information about the prison
so let 's do some UNknown work
camera electronic tape measure dry ice
what 's this ?
you need to come with me doc
i have a doctor 's appointment for my pregnancy in a few minutes
it UNknown l wait
damn baby i ain 't gonna hurt you
hell i ain 't even gonna touch you
see i run the motor pool detail in here
yeah you can call me agent UNknown
i could call you a lot of things
where are you headed ?
are you threatening sara ?
bullets fly michael
funny hearing that from the guy who put her in prison in the first place
no i didn 't put her in prison
state of florida did
so ah where 's all your little buddies ?
fence line is 4 feet from the road
and 32 feet from the east camera
i 'm going as fast as i can UNknown
he followed you ?
you guys almost done ?
well you 'r e just a natural
i bet you are a hell of a surgeon
handing out UNknown to cons were makin you no damn surgeon !
what in the hell is the matter with you ?
you ain 't even ask me if she can come
one day for real !
can we go one day without your mouth ?
you just a little bit easy on eyes you know ?
she 's just the jealous type
crazy is the type she 's more like it
it 's important though that uh that you have one
i have a family
is he here ?
18 years is a long time to wait
so you know
then you pick up that nasty oil take it out and put it in the UNknown
when i 'm good and ready
what 's burrows doing at the fence ?
please don 't make me ask you again sara
nobody here that UNknown l help you but yourself
are you going to answer me ?
you tried to kill me
line it up cons
what he 's paying his people to dust that UNknown chicken bitch pop my woman are good for a cut rate
just what kind of discount are you proposing here ?
tell him uh if he 's offering a 100 grand my girl will take 30
hey five stars
i 'm sorry i couldn 't hear you over the sound of that broken record
oh to what do we owe the honor ?
i UNknown e been thinking
well no need to be uh shy
just spit it out
no well maybe daddy change her mind
maybe she don 't want you here no more
take a walk
it 's just saying i do
see in order to make a commitment to a family
it 's something you gotta prove
that 's right we all did it
it 's a commitment to the family code
it 's a code you gotta wear
what 's going on ?
we gotta talk
what you do ?
they offered me my old job back if i came down here to spy on you
now the fed you 'r e talking about his name is UNknown
he 's running point
and i UNknown l help you if you need me
what else do you get ?
sara 's working the motor pool today at 4 o UNknown lock
motor pool is here
what about secondary entrances ?
no loading dock no personnel entrance
i think we can find a way inside
with all the different UNknown over the years the fence line is UNknown
but security cameras remain exactly where they UNknown e always been
they UNknown e never accounted for the difference
there 's a UNknown
it 's risky michael
how much time to tell sara where we going to meet her ?
it 's clean
do you have a warrant agent UNknown ?
a warrant ?
my testimony will be your brother let me in
once inside saw all this evidence right in plain sight
what judge gonna take your word over mine ?
what evidence ?
that prison was paid for by the taxpayers
so all you have evidence of is an UNknown citizen standing on a public road taking pictures of a public building
last i checked it 's not a crime
what if i said that i could get you on attempt just for having all these stuff ?
what if i told you that all this was peace offering ?
the warden won 't let me see my wife
so i figured if i found a few lapse in the security pointed them out as a gesture of good faith she might change her mind ?
is that so ?
you guys will let me know if anything comes up right ?
you UNknown l be the first to know
on the outside i was known for getting the job done
no matter what
now i 'm broke
like what ?
as i understand you 'd do favors for those who UNknown
is that true ?
i 'm a veteran around here
ain 't no reason to toss me !
you low leaf !
you know this !
who put that in here ? !
you ugh !
i know where the hold is
what y 'a ll looking at ?
i do no drugs !
somebody is going down there !
i love you too
once we break sara we 'r e on the boat we 'r e gone
they 'r e ordering the warden to allow UNknown UNknown
where are you going ?
they 'r e letting me sara
if she understood my letters she UNknown l find a way to tell me
oh my god !
i 'm okay
you 'r e in here because of me
i 'm sorry
i 'm trying
did you get my letter ?
but i hope you understood what i meant to tell you
you were there for me
and i will be there for you
about the photos and the mock up that you showed me at the loft
and i ran a few tests
lo and behold i UNknown e found a UNknown
right along the fence line over here due to our UNknown
you didn 't know about this did you ?
no no of course not
because you would UNknown e told me or the warden about it if you did right ?
well it 's a good thing i found this when i did in case anyone tries to escape
well if we can 't go through the fence then that leaves under or over
look how she gonna climb that fence without being seen ?
then she 's gotta go under
alright lets get some shovels
what was that you were saying about UNknown ?
couple of thoughts on that
a we don 't have a plane
b we don 't have a pilot
have you ever worn a parachute ?
don 't worry i think i UNknown e got a plan
but we 'r e gonna need some help from an old friend
just hear me out
i mean what kind of man will i be if i don 't quit your pro quote ?
tomorrow night at 7 30
that 's it
UNknown has put a hit on her that 's a one shot of keeping her alive
well you 'r e on a UNknown kind of damn lincoln
we UNknown l put 5 grand on your cake once this whole thing jumps off
the love of michael 's life is only worth of 5 000 ?
that 's the best we can do
i need six figures
UNknown for you i know somebody who does the general 's man
he 's got the UNknown for sara 's hit
you wire that money to me by UNknown tomorrow and we 'r e in business
what is his name ?
it 's your brother to you that agony is
come on you gotta give me more than that
when he saw me fixing that fence and UNknown that camera
you did a great job
job 's over now
your job will be over until you give us enough evidence to put him back behind bars
so what 's the latest ?
there 's nothing concrete
i 'm coming with you
you 'r e sitting next to me at the mess when i was poisoned
you 'd think you would UNknown e lasted this long if i wanted you dead ?
i want you dead
don 't you think it 's hard to stay alive when you know who 's coming after you ?
there 's 200 women in this prison
bet do you even get to gen pop ?
i 'm coming with you
or nobody 's going
because that means you 'r e safe
how does he think he 's gonna do this bro ?
he 's going to jump out of the plane
i know he 's gonna jump
the question is can he land ?
not without getting caught
it 's a big if
trusting t bag is crazy
michael we uh we really have to re think this
and i cut the parachute off before anyone can reach me
they 'r e going to be right on your ass
i can hide behind this building wait for a window
then i UNknown l make my way over here
that 's the chapel
why the chapel ?
they wound up here outside the fence
the administration building is connected to the chapel
which means that somewhere in that compound there is a UNknown exit
if we can get through it you can meet us there
how 's sara gonna get to the chapel ?
she UNknown l have to find a way
look we 'r e doing this at UNknown tonight just like we UNknown e planned
where have you been ?
what did i missed ?
i need you to find a plane and a pilot
and you two to take care of t bag
find out exactly who has this money and where they 'r e keeping it
and then we have to get it
by UNknown tonight
is everybody onboard ?
well i got the cash
but there UNknown l may be some delay in final delivery
the woman we hired is having trouble getting near sara UNknown
then hire somebody else
i 'm okay
hell we all did
it 's cool
aren 't you heard ?
UNknown you have a visitor
say hello to your husband for me
what 's wrong ?
things aren 't working out
but from where we 'r e standing right now there 's only one option
do you need more time to think ?
pray for us ?
maybe i UNknown l do the same
how can i rob someone if i UNknown e no clue who he is ?
the UNknown outside says that UNknown had one visitor yesterday
a joe daniels
you know how many daniels live miami ?
listen my friend you 'r e in no position to makin demands
i put my ear on the ground and come up with some details
there 's a guy i 'd busted 20 years ago running drugs across the gulf
he must UNknown e jumped out of a few planes huh ?
it 's not easy hitting the x especially at night
don 't worry
it 's a test
then you can 't just go to the building shut it and blow it out ?
not to mention that it UNknown l kill you
so we have to find another way
get out of the way !
what happened here ? !
i didn 't see anything sir
UNknown and morgan
good to see you UNknown
what you get into here UNknown ?
jumping off 1500 feet ain 't going to be easy
you UNknown e gone back on your word already ?
let 's not forget who 's doing who a favor here
no i did not
and it 's not my fault they jumped
sounds good to me
we come up with a new plan
no there 's no time alex
it 's not just sara 's life at risk
i understand that
if i don 't make it
i want you to make sure sara and my brother get out of the country alive
i need to know they 'r e gonna be okay
and i 'm gonna trust that you UNknown l do everything you can to make that happen
it came via messenger from uh the lady side
my man on the outside needs to know who to call for the birthday present
who 's birthday is it ?
well see to it that it gets back to the same place
is that enough information or you need a social security number too ?
that UNknown l do
no wire no fire
i have no UNknown at all about singing it loud and clear you understand ?
you know what ?
you guys can fly to costa rica
and after we rob him i UNknown l take the money to UNknown green and uh wire to the bank
you will meet us at the airstrip right ?
might give a shot now
nobody 's talking huh ?
girl 's dead
i made it in the workshop
want to give to my daughter emily a birthday gift on her actual birthday
so i need to get out of here
you 'r e never sentimental
oh i 'm not
we need to get to the chapel
i 'm gonna need you
well this is mr daniels but i didn 't order any painters
get out !
gotta get that parachute
i UNknown l think of something
you better think of something fast cause we have company
i hope you 'r e ready for a fight princess
this one 's to the death
do you think you can UNknown her ?
just be ready
was the gift earned ?
what in the hell are you talking about ?
the birthday present !
my personal preference is two UNknown bars and a copy of the times
so i see you in the am ?
you worthless son of a whore
go to hell !
unless i become the king of that prison too
alright from takeoff the prison 's gonna come up real fast
so whatever you gotta do to get ready do it now
you get it
UNknown 's just dropped me off on the way to wire it
i 'm goin to see how long it 's gonna take and we get going
you sure that thing 's gonna hold you up ?
yes it UNknown l be fine
what about you ?
you 'r e gonna be the type of father our dad never was
someone to look up to
take care michael
he 's got a plane
he 's got a parachute into the yard
call in reinforcements
and be ready to turn off all exterior lights
UNknown won 't see what 's coming until it 's too late
and bring me sara UNknown
i need to make this right with you okay ?
you know i still owe you one big juicy favor
later blue eyes
you remember that ?
told me i was going to give it to one of my kids one day
not only did i get knocked up but the girl in the family
and i practically raised agatha and she was no killer
now i can say that much for myself
you didn 't know what i had in mind yet
okay listen you 'r e right
agatha isn 't a killer
she was just a real bitch with a bit of more than she need to
they coming right through here okay ?
federal agent todd UNknown
emergency team takes priority sir
i 'm the leader of the emergency team
now let me inside
come on !
hey fellas !
we 'r e looking for her right now
oh my god !
i 'm not gonna make it on my own
either leave me with tools here or make up your damn mind
are you gonna be able to make it ?
please i just
damn it con
is there anyone else here ?
so i came to pray
see if someone would watch over her
go check it out
so do i
nobody gets in or out of this prison
i don 't care if it 's the president having to take a piss you tell him to turn the hell around
get a team
you think UNknown make the drop on time ?
i don 't know
we 'r e in UNknown
what for ?
i don 't know
we 'r e going to get through here ?
on the other side is a kind of an escape patch for the UNknown
in case of a riot
if this is the same system they have in fox river that door can only be open remotely from the centre control
that 's why we UNknown e gone and ask for help
michael UNknown is about to stage a prison break
and i know how he 's gonna do it
exactly what did UNknown asks you to do ?
just light a fire in my cell
and the rest the rest will just take care of itself
a fire alarm
state law mandatory UNknown
shut up !
whatever he 's up to he needs noise and he needs chaos
UNknown the smoke detection system the fire alarm and while you 'r e at it kill the horn
if anybody so much as bends a blade of grass in this place
i want him to be able to hear it
why are we waiting for ?
we made a deal
that 's what we 'r e waiting for
michael there 's a it 's okay
see there 's only one thing you can count on when you 'r e dealing with t bag
he 's a rat
on the other end of that is UNknown and after that there 's a boat mounted for the white sands and blue water
a power UNknown to the system will UNknown the reader for just a few seconds
just long enough for you to open that so get ready
3 2 1
it 's okay
i know what i have to do
i need units to the chapel
the battery wasn 't UNknown enough power
we have to blow up the system for the whole building
this is the main fuse
if i yanked that everything will go dark for a second
i UNknown these two cables
if i UNknown these two cables there UNknown l be a lot of noise every light bulb in this place is going to blow
as soon as that happens you need to open that hatch
and i want you to start running
and that someone 's gotta be you
you don 't understand
i 'm not leaving unless you 'r e coming with me
but i am coming with you
i love you
where 's michael ?

what do you mean by that ?

why am i being punished ? !
i 'm the guy through the window !

it 's his UNknown
i was supposed to wire it down to costa rica for you to pick up but uh
i ran into some trouble
i 'm sorry

as much as to say well now how about that ?
do i actually see with my own very eyes
a man who 's not heard of a jellicle cat ?
what 's a jellicle cat ?
what 's a jellicle cat ?
what 's a jellicle cat ?
the naming of cats is a difficult matter
it isn 't just one of your holiday games
you may think at first i 'm as mad as a hatter
when i tell you a cat must have three different names
first of all there 's the name that the family use daily
such as peter augustus alonzo or james
such as victor or jonathan george or bill bailey
all of them sensible everyday names
there are UNknown names if you think they sound sweeter
some for the gentlemen some for the dames
such as plato UNknown UNknown UNknown
but all of them sensible everyday names
but i tell you a cat needs a name that 's particular
a name that 's peculiar and more dignified
else how can he keep up his tail UNknown
or spread out his whiskers or cherish his pride ?
of names of this kind i can give you a quorum
such as UNknown UNknown or UNknown
such as UNknown or else UNknown
names that never belong to more than one cat
but above and beyond there 's still one name left over
and that is the name that you never will guess
the name that no human research can discover
but the cat himself knows and will never confess
when you notice a cat in profound meditation
the reason i tell you is always the same
his mind is engaged in a UNknown UNknown
of the thought of the thought
of the thought of his name
jellicle cats come one come all
the jellicle moon is shining bright
UNknown come to the jellicle ball
jellicle cats come out tonight
UNknown come to the jellicle ball
jellicle cats meet once a year
at the jellicle ball where we all rejoice
and the jellicle leader will soon appear
and make what is known as the jellicle choice
when old UNknown just before dawn
through a silence you feel you could cut with a knife
announces the cat who can now be reborn
and come back to a different jellicle life
for waiting up there is the UNknown layer
full of wonders one jellicle only will see
and UNknown ask because UNknown dare
who will it be ?
who will it be ?
i have a UNknown cat in mind
her name is UNknown
with tiger stripes and leopard spots
all day she sits beneath the stair
or on the steps or on the mat
she sits and sits and sits and sits
and that 's what makes a UNknown cat
that 's what makes a UNknown cat
but when the day 's hustle and bustle is done
then the UNknown cat 's work is but hardly begun
and when all the family 's in bed and asleep
she UNknown up her skirts to the basement to creep
she is deeply concerned with the ways of the mice
their behaviour 's not good and their manners not nice
so when she has got them lined up on the UNknown
she teaches them music UNknown and UNknown
i have a UNknown cat in mind
her name is UNknown
and tie it into sailor knots
she sits upon the window UNknown
or anything that 's smooth and flat
she sits and sits and sits and sits
and that 's what makes a UNknown cat
that 's what makes a UNknown cat
but when the day 's hustle and bustle is done
then the UNknown cat 's work is but hardly begun
she thinks that the cockroaches just need employment
to prevent them from idle and wanton UNknown
so she 's formed from that lot of disorderly UNknown
a troop of well disciplined helpful boy scouts
with a purpose in life and a good deed to do
and she 's even created
a beetles tattoo !
thank you my dears
if you offer me pheasant i 'd rather have grouse
if you put me in a house i would much prefer a flat
if you put me in a flat then i 'd rather have a house
if you set me on a mouse then i only want a rat
if you set me on a rat then i 'd rather chase a mouse
the rum UNknown UNknown is a curious cat
and there isn 't any call for me to shout it
for he will do as he do do
and there 's no doing anything about it
the rum UNknown UNknown is a terrible bore
when you let me in then i want to go out
i 'm always on the wrong side of every door
and as soon as i get home then i 'd like to get about
i like to lie in a bureau drawer
but i make such a fuss if i can 't get out
the rum UNknown UNknown is a curious cat
and there isn 't any use for you to doubt it
for he will do as he do do
and there 's no doing anything about it
the rum UNknown UNknown is a curious beast
my UNknown ways are a matter of habit
now if you offer me fish then i always want a feast
and if there isn 't any fish then i won 't eat rabbit
if you offer me cream then i sniff and sneer
for i only like what i find for myself
the rum UNknown UNknown is UNknown and knowing
the rum UNknown UNknown doesn 't care for a cuddle
so i UNknown l on up into your sewing
cos there 's nothing i enjoy like a horrible UNknown
the rum UNknown UNknown is a curious cat
the rum UNknown UNknown doesn 't care for a cuddle
the rum UNknown UNknown is a curious cat
and there isn 't any need for me to spout it
for he will do as he do do
and there 's no
which opens on her
and stained with sand
twist like a crooked pin
she haunted many a low resort
near the UNknown road of UNknown court
she UNknown about the no man 's land
from the rising sun to the friend at hand
and the postman UNknown as he scratched his head
you 'd really have thought she 'd ought to be dead
and who would ever suppose
in fact he 's remarkably fat
he doesn 't haunt UNknown he has eight or nine clubs
for he 's the st james 's street cat
he 's the cat we all greet as he walks down the street
in his coat of UNknown black
no commonplace UNknown have such well cut trousers
or such an impeccable back
in the whole of st james 's the smartest of names is
the name of this UNknown of cats
and we 'r e all of us proud to be UNknown or bowed to
by UNknown jones in white spats
in the whole of st james 's the smartest of names is
the name of this UNknown of cats
and we 'r e all of us proud to be UNknown or bowed to
by UNknown jones in white spats
my visits are occasional to the senior educational
and it is against the rules
for any one cat to belong both to that
and the joint superior schools
for a similar reason when game is in season
i 'm found not at fox 's but UNknown 's
i am frequently seen at the gay stage and screen
which is famous for UNknown and UNknown
in the season of venison i give my ben 's on
to the UNknown 's UNknown bones
and just before noon 's not a moment too soon
to drop in for a drink
at the UNknown
at the siamese or at the glutton
if i look full of gloom then i UNknown e UNknown at the tomb
on cabbage rice pudding
the name of this UNknown of cats
and we 'r e all of us proud to be UNknown or bowed to
by UNknown jones in white
UNknown jones in white
so much in this way passes UNknown 's day
at one club or another he 's found
it can be no surprise that under our eyes
he has grown UNknown round
he 's a twenty five UNknown or i am a UNknown
and he 's putting on weight every day
but i 'm so well preserved because i UNknown e observed
all me life a routine and i 'd say
i am still in me prime i shall last out me time
that 's the word from this UNknown of cats
it must and it shall be spring in UNknown mall
while UNknown jones wears white
UNknown jones wears white
as UNknown clowns quick change comedians
tightrope UNknown and acrobats
we make our home in victoria grove
this is merely our centre of operation
for we are incurably given to UNknown
when the family UNknown for sunday dinner
their minds made up that they won 't get thinner
on argentine joint potatoes and greens
and the cook would appear from behind the scenes
and say in a voice that is broken with sorrow
i 'm afraid you must wait and have dinner tomorrow
the joint has gone from the oven like that !
then the family will say it 's that horrible cat !
was it UNknown or UNknown !
and most of the time they leave it at that
UNknown and UNknown
and some of the time you would say it was luck
and some of the time you would say it was weather
we 'd go through the house like a hurricane
and no sober person could take his oath
was it UNknown or UNknown ?
or could you have sworn that it might have been both ?
and when you hear a dining room smash
or up from the pantry there comes a loud crash
or down from the library came a loud ping
from a vase which was UNknown
said to be ming
it was UNknown
and there 's nothing at all to be done about that
old UNknown ?
well of all things
i believe it is old UNknown
old UNknown 's lived a long time
he 's a cat who has lived many lives in succession
he was famous in proverb and famous in rhyme
a long while before queen victoria 's UNknown
old UNknown 's buried nine wives
and more i am tempted to say ninety nine
and his numerous UNknown UNknown and thrives
and the village is proud of him in his decline
at the sight of that placid and UNknown UNknown
when he sits in the sun
on the UNknown wall
i believe it is old UNknown
well of all things
i believe it is old UNknown
well of all things can it be really ?
i believe it is old UNknown
well of all things
and be careful
on the night we make the jellicle choice
and now that the jellicle leader is here
jellicle cats can all rejoice
of the awe full battle of the UNknown and the UNknown
together with some account
and the intervention
are proud and UNknown passionate foes
it is always the same wherever one goes
and the UNknown and the UNknown are the most people say
that they do not like fighting yet once in a way
they now and again join into the UNknown and they
now on the occasion of which i shall speak
almost nothing had happened for nearly a week and that 's a long time for a UNknown or a UNknown
the big police dog was away from his beat
i don 't know the reason but most people think
he slipped into the wellington arms for a drink
and no one at all was about on the street
when a UNknown and a UNknown happened to meet
they did not advance or exactly retreat
but they UNknown at each other and scraped their hind feet
and started to bark bark bark bark bark bark
until you could hear them all over the park
and they 'd bark bark bark bark bark bark
until you could hear them all over the park
now the UNknown although people may say what they please
is no british dog but a heathen chinese
and so all the UNknown when they heard the uproar
some came to the window some came to the door
there were surely a dozen more likely a score
and together they started to UNknown and UNknown
in their UNknown UNknown heathen chinese
but a terrible din is what UNknown like
for your UNknown dog is a UNknown yorkshire UNknown
there are dogs out of every nation the irish the welsh and the dane
the russian dutch and UNknown and even from china and spain
from the poodle the pom the UNknown
and the UNknown who walks on a chain
and to those that are UNknown and UNknown
that my meaning be perfectly plain
that my name is little tom UNknown and you better not do it again
and his UNknown scottish cousins are UNknown and UNknown
and every dog jack of them notable fighters
and so they stepped out with their pipers in order
playin when the blue UNknown come over the border
then the UNknown and the UNknown held no longer aloof
but some from the balcony some from the roof
joined into the din with a bark bark bark bark bark bark
until you could hear them all over the park
UNknown UNknown UNknown UNknown
the traffic all stopped and the underground trembled
and some of the neighbours were so much afraid
that they started to ring up the fire brigade
when suddenly up from a small basement flat
why who should stalk out
but the great rumpus cat ?
his eyes were like UNknown
and his jaws were amazing
and when he looked out through the bars of the area
you never saw anything
the UNknown and the UNknown quickly took warning
he looked to the sky and he gave a great leap
and they every last one of them scattered like sheep
and when the police dog returned to his beat
there wasn 't a single one left on the street
when the blue UNknown come over the border
all hail and all bow to
the great rumpus cat
UNknown dogs and cats all must
like UNknown come to dust thunder rolls
jellicle cats come one come all
the jellicle moon is shining bright
UNknown come to the jellicle ball
jellicle cats are black and white
jellicle cats are rather small
jellicle cats are merry and bright
and pleasant to hear when we UNknown
jellicle cats have cheerful faces
jellicle cats have bright black eyes
we like to practise our airs and graces
and wait for the jellicle moon to rise
jellicle cats develop slowly
jellicle cats are UNknown UNknown
we know how to dance a UNknown and a jig
until the jellicle moon appears
we make our UNknown and take our repose
UNknown wash behind their ears
UNknown dry between their toes
jellicle cats are white and black
jellicle cats are of moderate size
UNknown jump like a jumping jack
jellicle cats have moonlit eyes
we 'r e quiet enough in the morning hours
we 'r e quiet enough in the afternoon
UNknown our UNknown powers
jellicle cats are black and white
jellicle cats as we said are small
if it happens to be a stormy night
we will practise a caper or two in the hall
if it happens the sun is shining bright
you would say we had nothing to do at all
we are resting and saving ourselves to be right
for the jellicle moon and the jellicle ball
jellicle cats come out tonight
jellicle cats come one come all
the jellicle moon is shining bright
UNknown come to the jellicle ball
jellicle cats come out tonight
jellicle cats come one come all
the jellicle moon is shining bright
UNknown come to the jellicle ball
music stops abruptly
is torn and stained with sand
and you see
twist like a crooked pin
has the moon lost her memory ?
she is smiling alone
and the wind
and soon it will be morning
i can smile at the old days
i was beautiful then
what happiness was
UNknown the experience in a different form
beyond any meaning
the past experience
let your memory lead you
open up enter in
then a new life
let your memory lead you
open up enter in
then a new life
his name as i ought to have told you before
is really asparagus
that we usually call him just gus
his coat 's very shabby he 's thin as a rake
and he suffers from UNknown that makes his paws shake
yet he was in his youth quite the smartest of cats
but no longer a terror to mice or to rats
for he isn 't the cat that he was in his prime
though his name was quite famous he says in his time
and whenever he joins his friends at their club
which takes place at the back of the UNknown pub
he loves to UNknown them if someone else pays
with UNknown drawn from his UNknown days
for he once was a star of the highest degree
he has acted with irving he has acted with tree
and he likes to relate his success on the halls
where the gallery once gave him
seven cat calls
i have played in my time
every possible part
i 'd UNknown UNknown
and i knew how to let the cat out of the bag
i knew how to act with my back and my tail
with an hour of rehearsal i never could fail
i 'd a voice that would soften the hardest of hearts
whether i took the lead or in character parts
i have sat by the bedside of poor little nell
when the curfew was rung then i swung on the bell
in the pantomime season i never fell flat
and i once UNknown dick UNknown 's cat
but my grandest creation
then if someone will give him a UNknown of gin
he will tell how he once played a part in east lynne
at a shakespeare performance he once walked on pat
when some actor suggested the need for a cat
and i say that these kittens they do not get trained
as we did in the days when victoria UNknown
they never get drilled in a regular troupe
and they think they are smart just to jump through a hoop
and he says as he scratches himself with his claws
well the theatre is certainly not what it was
these modern productions are all very well
but there 's nothing to equal from what i hear tell
that moment of mystery
music fades away ghostly wind
these modern productions
from what i hear tell
that moment of mystery
there 's a whisper down the line at eleven thirty nine
when the night mail 's ready to depart
saying UNknown where is UNknown ?
has he gone to hunt the UNknown ?
we must find him or the train can 't start
all the guards and all the porters and the UNknown 's daughters
would be searching high and low
saying UNknown where is UNknown ?
for unless he 's very UNknown
then the night mail just can 't go
at eleven forty two with the signal overdue
and the passengers all frantic to a man
that 's when i would appear and i 'd UNknown to the rear
i 'd been busy in the luggage van
then he gave one flash of his glass green eyes
and the signal went all clear
they 'd be off at last for the northern part
of the northern hemisphere
you could say that by and large it was me who was in charge
of the sleeping car express
from the driver and the guards to the UNknown playing cards
i 'd supervise them all more or less
down the corridor he paces and UNknown all the faces
of the travellers in the first and the third
he UNknown control by a regular patrol
and he 'd know at once if anything occurred
he would watch you without UNknown and he saw what you were thinking
and it 's certain that he didn 't approve
of UNknown and riot so that folk were very quiet
when UNknown was about and on the move
you could play no pranks with UNknown
he 's a cat that cannot be ignored
so nothing went wrong on the northern mail
when UNknown was aboard
with their name written up on the door
and the berth was very neat with a newly folded sheet
and not a speck of dust on the floor
there was every sort of light you could make it dark or bright
and a button you could turn to make a breeze
and a funny little basin you 'r e supposed to wash your face in
and a crank to shut the window should you sneeze
then the guard looked in politely and would ask you very brightly
do you like your morning tea weak or strong ?
but i was just behind him and was ready to remind him
for UNknown won 't let anything go wrong
when they crept into their cosy berths
and pulled down the UNknown
they ought to reflect it was very nice
to know that they wouldn 't be bothered by mice
they would leave all that to the railway cat
the cat of the railway train
UNknown the railway cat
UNknown the railway cat
in the watches of the night i was always fresh and bright
every now and then i 'd have a cup of tea
with perhaps a drop of scotch when i was keeping on the watch
only stopping here and there to catch a flea
they were fast asleep at UNknown and so they never knew
that i was walking up and down the station
they were sleeping all the while i was busy at carlisle
where i met the station master with UNknown
they might see me at UNknown if i summoned the police
if there was anything they ought to know about
when they got to UNknown there they did not have to wait
for UNknown will help them to get out
which says i UNknown l see you again
you will meet without fail on the midnight mail
the cat of the railway train
the cat of the railway
train crashing and banging
he 's called the hidden paw
for he 's the master criminal
who can defy the law
he 's the UNknown of scotland yard
the flying squad 's despair
for when they reach the scene of crime
UNknown 's not there !
UNknown UNknown there 's no one like UNknown
he 's broken every human law
he breaks the law of gravity
his powers of UNknown
and when you reach the scene of crime
UNknown 's not there
you may look up in the air
but i tell you once and once again UNknown 's not there !
UNknown 's a ginger cat
he 's very tall and thin
you would know him if you saw him
for his eyes are sunken in
his brow is deeply lined with thought
his head is highly UNknown
his coat is dusty from neglect
his whiskers are UNknown
with movements like a snake
and when you think he 's half asleep
he 's always wide awake
UNknown UNknown there 's no one like UNknown
for he 's a fiend in UNknown shape
a monster of UNknown
you may see him in the square
but when a crime 's discovered then UNknown 's not there
he 's UNknown respectable
and his footprints are not found in
any files of scotland yard 's
and when the UNknown 's looted
or the jewel case is UNknown
or when the milk is missing
or another UNknown 's been UNknown
or the greenhouse glass is broken
and the trellis past repair
there 's the wonder of the thing UNknown 's not there !
UNknown UNknown there 's no one like UNknown
there never was a cat
of such UNknown and UNknown
he always has an alibi
and one or two to spare
whatever time the deed took place UNknown wasn 't there
and they say that all the cats
whose wicked deeds are widely known
i might mention UNknown
for the cat who all the time
just controls the operations
UNknown UNknown there 's no one like UNknown
he 's a fiend in UNknown shape
a monster of UNknown
you may see him in the square
but when a crime 's discovered then UNknown
we have to find
the original UNknown cat there can be no doubt about that
please listen to me and don 't UNknown
all his inventions are off his own bat
there 's no such cat in the metropolis he holds all the patent UNknown
for performing surprising illusions
from mr UNknown UNknown turn
and we all say
as magical mr UNknown
from his ears to the tip of his tail
he can creep through the UNknown crack
he can walk on the UNknown rail
he can pick any card from the pack
he 's equally cunning with dice
he 's always deceiving you into believing
that he 's only hunting for mice
he can play any trick with a cork
or a spoon and a bit of fish paste
if you look for a knife or a fork
and you think that it 's merely misplaced
you have seen it one moment but then it is gone
but you find it next week laying out on the lawn
and we all say
as magical mr UNknown UNknown !
as magical mr UNknown
as magical mr UNknown
and you would think there was nobody UNknown
but his voice can be heard on the roof
while he was UNknown up by the fire
and he 's sometimes been heard by the fire
while he was about on the roof
at least we all heard that somebody UNknown
which is UNknown proof
and i UNknown e known the family to call
him in from the garden for hours
while he was asleep in the hall
and not long ago this phenomenal cat
produced seven kittens
and we all say
as magical mr UNknown
produced seven kittens
as magical mr UNknown
as magical mr UNknown
as magical mr UNknown
as magical mr UNknown
and a rose that is fading
roses wither away
i am waiting
announces the cat who can now be reborn
and come back to a different jellicle life
let your memory lead you
open up enter in
then a new life
i can smile at the old days
i was beautiful then
let the memory
the stale cold smell
i must think of the new life
and i mustn 't give in
when the dawn comes
and the new day
all alone with the memory
of my days in the sun
if you touch me
look a new day
up up up up to the UNknown layer
up up up past the russell hotel
up up up up to the UNknown layer
up up up past the russell hotel
up up up up to the UNknown layer
up up up past the russell hotel
up up up up to the UNknown layer
up up up past the jellicle moon
up up up up to the UNknown layer
up up up past the jellicle moon
up up up up to the UNknown layer
the UNknown divinity
and my opinion now is that
you should need no interpreter
to understand our character
that cats are very much like you
you UNknown e seen us both at work and games
and learnt about our proper names
our habits and our UNknown
but how would you
and say a cat
and say a cat
don 't speak till you
are spoken to
i say you should address a cat
but always keep in mind that he
address him in
to treat you as a trusted friend
some little token of esteem
is needed like a dish of cream
and you might now and then supply
some caviar or UNknown pie
some UNknown grouse or salmon paste
he 's sure to have his personal taste
and so in time you reach your aim
and call him
these UNknown of respect
a cat 's entitled to expect
these UNknown of respect
everything okay down there ?
piece of cake
okay now your UNknown are down because of a power UNknown or a grid UNknown or maybe even a bomb

it wanted to move and you were the only one with the key

UNknown thought would happen here the way home
and still up there ?
three days !
because i do not know what it means
the world is too clearly from the mountain
in the name of the lord who has given him the pen
but you spoke
alone in the cave
and the angel said to him once more
when muhammad returned from the mountain saw the angel gabriel in the form of man in the background
no matter where i looked there it was
and gabriel returned to say
i am gabriel and you 'r e the muhammad messenger of god
who told you this ?
his wife ali y his friend abu UNknown
be careful whom you talk

the bones of a dead person can relive he says
because the creator of man can UNknown
the gods could leave and benefit to another city

i had you in my arms as a child
i can not see you hurt
if you refuse they will attack
i am your father and obey me as long as i live !

muhammad gives me more
get him out of here father
it is not only our father UNknown
in mecca it is new
god has already said before
noah moses jesus
now god repeats muhammad and returns to be new
who is it ?
the words of god himself
when you get to the sun and falling stars and the mountains disappear and camels are abandoned
the following wild animals seas and grow when UNknown the souls and newborn girl wonder why he was buried alive
when you open the books and separating the heavens
then every soul will know how to act
were there UNknown when god sent these words ?
where were you ? with muhammad again ?
what happens now ?
that god has always helped
but it fell
that the true god is invisible
is not made of clay
UNknown we see the gods in the UNknown every day
i fear for you
listen to muhammad muhammad is generous itself
da and shares
dangerous ideas ?
that the rich should not UNknown the poor !
that the strong should not UNknown the weak !
that women should be able choose or reject a marriage !
to stop the burial of newborn girls !
i was lucky with your mother
yes but we hardly got to know UNknown
and you have not born
UNknown like to bury my sister
but my father was unable to do so
no third time
UNknown that is the custom
i promised to go to the home of muhammad pray there
yes it 's a good man
you said that you can talk ?
which gods ?
muhammad speaks only for himself
muhammad transmitted the words of god to write
that is the UNknown
but with his heart open
you punishable for his insolence
every year come arabian tribes to mecca to pray and to buy think that would replace 300 gods for a single invisible it is everywhere even on the moon ?
what would then be mecca ?
the gods are our worship and our income
you can buy and sell god
boy you UNknown l win a few lashes
UNknown be sensible
think UNknown who bought it it equal to me ?
one very attractive idea for the poor and slaves
take the whip
UNknown UNknown !
look who caused anarchy !
infected to the slaves !
if you believe in the gods remember that they are the gods of your master
i bought your humanity when you paid for
will be punished !
who is stronger now ?
your love and your god ?
there is only one god
UNknown UNknown rocks !
there is only one god
swear that slave preached !
UNknown lord !
we can not sell a slave for punishment the offer is for UNknown
take him back no longer serves me i 'm done with it
god said to announce the messenger of islam
open the windows the world heard emerged from the darkness know the word of god and his messenger there is one god and muhammad is his messenger
he is the light
god is great out of darkness
join our march towards the UNknown !
muhammad and islam rebellion called shall take hold of our gods !
we will defend the UNknown to the gods !
defend the gods !
there is only one god and muhammad is the messenger of god
protect the prophet
it is enough !
the prophet said
salt of the UNknown !
your prophet is a fraud kill him !
protect the prophet UNknown UNknown of the guards !
how to talk about truth or lie if he said anything yet ?
muhammad is a fraud
i belong to the religion of my nephew
who has the courage to fight to do it with me !
muhammad a night in the desert
i realize that god is not safe
who would have believed that UNknown their wines and their hunt would join muhammad !
the more you hit attracting more people !
how can an illiterate that can climb the mountain and back to three days full of poetry ?
if only poetry
muhammad promised paradise that found by your audience
we will be less eager to hear
start with the weakest !
say it 's your god UNknown
there is only one god and muhammad is the messenger of god
UNknown your father and your mother are the first martyrs of islam
will paradise !
the prophet said that we should stay at mecca
if you are killed one by one
muhammad said that UNknown is a christian king in whose country does not commit UNknown
must start today
follow in his footsteps and suddenly disappeared
there low and let the vultures away !
we are honest traders
UNknown UNknown !
i think i can bring them back
i do not know where to begin
you have our friendship you can start it
some slaves have escaped to your kingdom
we will refund your slave like you would with our own
there are some free men among them rebel
there are religious rebels all religions were UNknown
the bodies of slaves are available but jesus is our shepherd and our souls are his sheep
betrayed the religion of their parents follow a lunatic called prophet
i can not hear them without souls chained
dug his own grave by failing slope
not bow to their prophet ?
muhammad is a man just us prostrate before god
UNknown what makes miracles muhammad ?
if a prophet UNknown the sky with miracles
true the prophets miracles so we can recognize them
muhammad is the miracle of the holy UNknown
a book !
at UNknown god sent the apostles tongues of fire to speak all languages these miracles exist today ?
i think not enough is enough have not supported their reasons
during the persecution in mecca muhammad told us to go to UNknown
the land of the king right !
it is a deserved punishment
why posted here ?
is like drinking water from a mirage !
now i hear them
there were no laws of heaven
the rich to the poor and ignorant piety natural that a man feels for the other is accused of UNknown the order !
against all this UNknown man has reached a chosen by god and who believe !
is out of it i ask you to be serene
i talk about the messenger of god
called wood and stone the gods is ignorant !
it is not the idol and the figure which but cherish the spirit
i understand that UNknown is not always well understood
god created man from a man and a woman
UNknown you must respect the womb that gave you life !
why their gods are mute 300 and this god is telling ?
god has spoken through
why not now believe that speaks to us through muhammad ?
who taught him those names ?
what the UNknown says
jesus christ and a carpenter what they say christ and muhammad are rays a single lamp
a lie !
father son and holy spirit
what to know christ ?
that god can not have a child
tell me about christ
he said apostle !
what the UNknown says jesus birth ?
let me repeat the words of the holy UNknown
come to me
how he turned away to a place in this as the angel gabriel came as a messenger for you that would give birth to a son
and gabriel replied
he will be a signal for men and a sign of our mercy and was ordained
the difference between you and me
UNknown bien !
his uncle UNknown protects well
miss uncle and nephew
anyone trading with them !
not own any land !
do not give them shelter or food !
do not marry a woman until it UNknown !
these were the worst years of muhammad
for three years suffered elements of the desert
although the year but had not yet arrived
his first wife died UNknown and then his protector abu UNknown
until the last moment abu UNknown tried to reconcile the UNknown of mecca with muhammad !
only asked a few words
that there is one god
but the words he wants UNknown an all gods
they are afraid even to listen !
what to do ?
then UNknown when their mission seemed to fail the situation has changed
a delegation from the rich but UNknown UNknown city went to see it at night asked him to UNknown between UNknown involved in UNknown civil strife and war
muhammad accepted on one condition
to believe in one god !
one moment !
this commitment means war our gods are firewood that 's what it means
if you accept no return because muhammad is the messenger we announced the jews
i doubt that will be now !
those who do not follow me
we deliver to the only god you and muhammad the messenger of god it belongs to us and we belong !
testimony that there is no god but god and you 'r e the muhammad messenger of god
bring your followers your brothers with us to UNknown to medina
muhammad became a nation received a city held commitments
and you UNknown king of medina last night you lost your kingdom !
should you worry about abu UNknown something every time you shop to UNknown need to stagger him
gets in your business
wait how long ?
and in the meantime ?
accept his call i think i gave him privileges
is that correct ?
i do not think so !
it may not be necessary
we have an idea kill muhammad
where is the fault if the responsibility for his death is shared between several families ?
that is my idea
his mind his words
who we are facing ?
will not go away !
the roads are being watched
UNknown in the desert
three to go to look for
what happens ?
been eating dates
they mark the footprints not me
UNknown going west ?
we will go with them
could be in that cave !
muhammad come here !
we should have gone north !
the tissue was all of a spider what was between muhammad and death
but his fate was being murdered
the guide led the UNknown in their flight through the desert and the hot days of june
in the medina waited to welcoming but fearful for their trip
see something !
i see them there look !
welcome to medina the city blessed their city messenger of god !
stay with me the messenger of god ?
i own the best home in medina
give me the honor to meet you stay with me !
stay with me !
will your home where god decides to stop the camel
released and where it rests there is the prophet
here we build the house of the prophet and first place for prayer and prayer the first mosque of islam god is great !
god is great !
look you too makes this we will
look i went to look any further
work is worship he says has 53 years of age how old are you ?
why not the human voice ?
omar what sounded
you UNknown i ?
go up there
testimony that there is no god but allah
witness that muhammad is the messenger of allah
witness that muhammad is the messenger of allah
come to prayer
allah is the greatest
each one will share with the other half !
let 's embrace our brother !
i 'm sick of this politics of kissing slaves prophets should worry about the UNknown
how is my child ?
praying like a horse
UNknown UNknown as a king
loyalty to islam is above the family and the tribe he said
that all UNknown are brothers
do not be led astray !
the real danger is here said the neighbor is equal to a same
that jews and christians are equal to UNknown
protect the jews that come to us
women have inheritance rights
this lunatic already gave them !
UNknown is forbidden
enough is enough !
take all values who have left in mecca your carpets houses its silver
and grown the caravan to damascus
friends UNknown !
be stolen everything they left behind !
the shops of abu UNknown and the house of the prophet were sold each fee or canvas everything they owned was brought to market
are a people without possessions !
not even fight for you ?
who is fighting ?
when the prophet says fight we will do so
peace now says
return to their jobs
prophet is the sword but hate how
we must face them !
stole our belongings and lead to damascus right in front of our noses
god must recover !
i beat his head
it is not the time for noon prayer !
god has only revealed to his messenger
fight until the religion is for god but if they stop
no more war for god UNknown not those who initiate wars fight in the way of god against those who attacked
you can not hurt women and children or elderly or disabled nor the man who till the land
you can not cut trees attack only those who have taken that have stolen their rights and UNknown with their possessions
you must fight even if your child is UNknown with them
mecca is more important than your family
UNknown your second son is your real blood
UNknown is not a coward
finish them tomorrow
return to your columns !
who are you ?
you do not
testimony that there is one god and that muhammad is his messenger
drop it !
and if you walk walk hand in hand
the prophet said that the prisoner release to teach reading to 10 UNknown
why not be long ?
why blame me with or without reason
UNknown should have gone but except for the caravan and thus our future
why i sing the name my father and my brother ?
they think i need to remember ?
with my nails !
UNknown will be my prey
and when you 'r e dead you eat the liver
take your blood
we cut to pieces UNknown
i get even
we will do whatever it takes
let our allies
in which city we arrived ?
one could fill their pockets here
a trader looks after his shop
it 's on the road
no response to my question
they stopped in mecca ?
of course we stopped to rest the camels
in mecca better than resting anywhere else in the world
bad news for you
they are preparing a very strong army
our strength is there
in mecca there is music in every house
i want to show an UNknown slave
it 's called UNknown
and your height in a shot silk of these
came to an end
it is a great army 3 000 men hundreds of horses
the beat at UNknown
have come to avenge UNknown
bring your swords
you can see it is that UNknown ?
he is his fortune
have a strange location
whatever happens the archers should contain riders
UNknown tell the prophet that we are ready
UNknown believes what ?
i would say it is a fair fight
we can see them and us
i 'm not afraid of what lies ahead of me
glory to UNknown !
return fight !
do not leave their places
return to their positions !
our center collapsed
muhammad is dead i saw him fall
there is no victory if muhammad lives
it 's in the mountains but fulfilling the mission
revenge of the UNknown
is protected has the advantage of the mountain
it is too risky !
today we are avenged of UNknown !
our dead have responded to yours !
our dead are in paradise those of you on fire !
you know that i am here
you 'r e also dead now !
UNknown you hear me ?
i am happy
UNknown ! open the UNknown
open it !
are crazy !
say that god provided for the defeat to test their faith
want their land and will have to mecca where stars go during the day not underestimate i have learned to my cost
yearn to mecca with all his soul
this year make a pilgrimage
if you believe in god as they do may not happen
i agree with you probably killed
do not move !
that is what they seek
peace be with you
sent to another person
what is this ?
who is this god ?
i do not know !
t UNknown !
muhammad the messenger of god
if you would have thought you were the messenger god would not have fought against you
this is more correct !
well this is better !
we agree not to continue the journey return to their land mecca is our land !
however may make the pilgrimage next year
only three days !
these messages are of muhammad the messenger of god to UNknown the sovereigns of the world
to UNknown emperor of persia
to UNknown UNknown of alexandria
god be with you !
there is difference of races in islam
arabic is not more than one foreign a white or a black
all respond equally to god
the faith is based on the neighbor wish same as one
the man who lies down with a full stomach while his neighbor suffers hunger is not a muslim
the ink of the scholar is more important the blood of the martyr
god welcomed the man who learns to read they have done so teach those who do not know
respect the bible and the gospel because these books also come from god
muhammad is but a man once when collecting firewood he said
but he looked at me and told me
god does not love the men who creating superior to its peers then i was looking suddenly stopped approached me and said
yes i am the prophet of god but i do not know what is my future
UNknown ! you UNknown e come to take me back ?
without UNknown UNknown there is no god but god and that muhammad is his messenger
may god forgive me all times that i fought against you
islam forgives the past
let me give you my
if but you were the most bitter sword against islam
now by god 's adjourn the top is a sword in his name
with god everything is easy !
and raises the dead becomes winners to losers
two years ago we thought that the truce was a defeat and now we win more hearts
what is that ?
abu UNknown !
abu UNknown am
we do not want war we respect the truce !
i came to talk to muhammad where he is ?
in the mosque
i come to UNknown the position of mecca
muhammad ! give me back ?
do not go !
i am here to testify
UNknown you are of my own blood intercede for me to hear me !
i am the leader of mecca ! why insult me like that ?
why not save the promises not fulfilled
who would have thought ?
abu UNknown requesting clemency
you dress like their religion grew out of nothing
i was blind i did not see the reality
tell mecca that their gods are dead no sense to resist god
go fast because here are close UNknown UNknown
you broke the truce
now you can attack them back !
we will defend from home !
it is pointless thousands the number is increasing every hour coward !
hind go home
look you 'r e defeated !
i swallowed and then spit you !
my father died and my brother for my husband away ?
we can not resist
there are so many fires that can not be counted
it is very beautiful
the smell of bread cooking yes means that are not intended to plunder the city
i hope so
take me to him
do not give me bread ?
what has come to say ?
i saw their UNknown and the men around him
is the strength they have given to your men
we can no longer resist
if you agree
it is not time to acknowledge that muhammad who is ?
UNknown a man can take years to find their faith and another minutes
god chooses the moment !
respect your doubts
i am only what god has given me
i would have helped
and you you are the messenger of god
do not abuse !
at least his words not force the door
UNknown hearts not home this is a permanent victory
i am afraid to leave
we must do it
it 's our way of life and were caught our mistakes
the gods were less than we do hours there is the entering the UNknown
in the name of allah the most merciful
god gave to abraham is home to be a sacred place and not believe in gods other than him
the UNknown has UNknown
mecca declared a holy place
no blood or cut a tree nor kill any living being in mecca
it soon became all arabia not only the new cult but the new laws and attitudes of islam
the prophet lived to see his work done but now felt the UNknown of his death
but there is still a great act as a prophet confirmation
in the pilgrimage gave his farewell message
listen well maybe not with you much longer give the weak of their food and clothing
god called them to account for their actions those who are alert to the absent
of all descendants of adam the best name amongst yourselves i will be that more heed to god
allah sends you his greetings and says
tell your community
on july 8 the year 632 at 63 years old muhammad died many of the faithful could not believe it how can a man die like that ?
abu UNknown 's friend of the prophet went to the mosque and said
those who love muhammad know that he was a man and died but know that god is alive and can not die
muhammad was buried in medina the mosque but the religion that preached reached the hearts resisted was UNknown
humanity is still close to mecca
the people of islam with their clothes white pilgrims all equal before god all united in their place of prayer
every soul in the community together to worship god
get up you no good piece of dung !
get up !
you damage my fightin dog you 'r e gonna be nothin but a sack of guts
i UNknown l kill you myself you son of a bitch !
the dog 's half dead
i 'm buying him
two hundred 's what i paid
that dog 's worth a fortune
a thousand !
we UNknown l cross again
nobody steals from me
come on !
trap ain 't gonna get away with this
at least he paid you 200 for that dog
shut up about that UNknown
can either of you men direct me to sergeant edgar UNknown ?
who goes there ?
somebody stole my dog !
go away hazel
are you sergeant edgar UNknown ?
you gotta to do something about this edgar
sound off kid
well well well
hell edgar that was my strongest dog
you were fighting that dog hazel
and from what i hear your strongest dog was a hair 's UNknown away from being bait
that 's a damned lie
i got witnesses !
it 's a 2 way radio sir
the newest thing
this one works
this UNknown here says that man should be brought up for trial
now what are you going to do edgar ?
i 'm going to close my eyes and pray you disappear
never had much luck UNknown
hey welcome stranger
my name 's w w i ain 't seen you in these parts before
where you comin from ?
i can tell you ain 't one of them fools that come up here from the south to get out of them UNknown
half of them starve to death and the other half freeze
more dead bodies up here in the last few years than i UNknown e seen in a lifetime and believe me i UNknown e been here a while
this store can 't hold all the ammo you got on this here list
but i UNknown l get you what i got
huntin UNknown i expect ain 't you ?
if you 'r e heading up to old curley 's i can save you the journey
UNknown got him last spring
ate through his eyelids and pumped him full of poison
curley finally got a gun and blew his brains out
that 's one way to stop the UNknown
let 's see a hundred even
rough travelin at night
we could talk some more
outpost to base over
read UNknown m and weep
two pair of kings up
i UNknown l have it set up real soon
swell so then we can hear them pen pushing heroes in UNknown giving us orders eh ?
i was thinking maybe we should have arrested those men for dog fighting and that UNknown too
dealer stands pat
looks like we got to build a big new jail
alvin 's going to arrest the whole town
let me give you a little advice eh kid ?
just throw those law books away
better to turn your eyes and let them fight their damn dogs
it 's a damn sight better than them killing each other
but you can 't let people get away with that making their own laws
the only thing you have to remember is UNknown 's law
you want to stay a UNknown then all you got to do is keep headquarters happy
and the only time they 'r e unhappy is when there 's a killing that 's not accounted for
so you account for all killings and you live to be an old UNknown just like me
you got that ?
now you got that ?
this is not going to feel very friendly
i even use it myself sometimes
you had the strength to come this far
i think you 'r e gonna make it
hell of a life bein a UNknown ain 't it kid ?
might help you sleep
probably gettin tired of old men like us
wants some younger blood
i was speaking for myself
here you are
got him in the kidney
if that had been a UNknown you 'd have been UNknown
well it wasn 't a damn UNknown and i 'm not dead
UNknown don 't you ever have anything good to say about anything ?
well what do you want kid a shout a holler and a cigar for doing something halfway right for once ?
no i guess not
clean your kill
no he 's just in a hurry to get back to his UNknown
he wasn 't always that way
come on let 's skin this before it freezes eh ?
no normal man lives in a little biddy hole like that
what the fuck we gonna do now ?
this is the dumbest thing i UNknown e ever done
oh yeah ?
i thought i asked you not to bring that up again
bring what up ?
couldn 't fit no more than 2 in that hole
ain 't no way in hell he 's gonna let tom and i in there
well i sure as hell ain 't goin up there
you 'r e so dumb i could sell you dirt !
i 'm sorry i shouldn 't have said that
i am sorry okay ?
i shouldn 't have said that
this is the dumbest thing i UNknown e ever done
hazel 's dog ain 't chained
we don 't want no trouble mister !
we 'r e real hungry and cold !
you let us warm ourselves any spare food we pay you twice the cost for the trouble !
i 'd feel better if you 'd lay those rifles down
sorry mister but the dog wasn 't chained so
don 't have any room in the cabin but if you want to get warm you can build yourselves a fire right around there
kill that goddamn dog !
let 's get out of here
son of a bitch !
shot his scalp off !
that son of a bitch has killed somebody !
come on let 's go !
we had been married 9 years when my late husband left me to come here and make his fortune
after a short time what little money we had was gone but
i managed alright on my own
now all that 's left to remember him by is this broken watch and a UNknown 's license
and i thank you for holding these things for me
but i want you all to know that i 'm glad i came here
because it wasn 't until now that
i fully realized how little i cared for the man that i will not miss him
take it easy kid
what do you mean ragged ?
look if you 'r e in a do or die contest with big stakes you let the other guy get a head start on you
take smaller UNknown and hold your breath eh ?
it looks like it 's getting to your head
when you see it 's getting to him turn that sucker up and bust it on down
then you pray to the lord you get the hell out before you fall flat on your ass
where did you learn them high school tricks ?
smooth boy you UNknown e got to think smooth
you 'r e standing on my feet
where 'd you say you learned this ?
damn i 'd drink his whiskey better than anybody around
so my uncle named that whiskey after me
that whiskey was called UNknown a hundred years before you were born
what is it ?
no but he was a first rate pitcher with the negro league
then he tried to make the move over to the majors by saying he was a UNknown
or was it cuban ?
they didn 't want to let me in the majors and you know why
damn right i know why
i must UNknown e heard that story 600 times
because i was too damn good
that 's why
they UNknown l never let a negro do that to a white fellow
tell her soon
she says you walk like you UNknown e got a roll of UNknown up your ass
she says she can wait for you in the UNknown
well there 's nothing in the book that says fucking 's against the law
i 'm surprised
oh god woman please
where is he ? !
i UNknown e got to talk to him now !
get out of my way !
the fucker who stole my dog !
and you let him be !
crazy bastard !
jimmy tom is dead !
i UNknown l take care of it
jimmy tom is dead !
i told you i would take care of it
get up !
hey he just wanted some supplies
bought two of my best UNknown and 700 rounds of ammo
from the way he acted he didn 't look crazy to me at least not any more crazy than anyone else around here
you dumb fuck
how the hell was i supposed to know who he was ?
700 rounds of ammo ?
bought it all
who is this guy ?
ever hear of the mad UNknown the one who steals gold from men 's teeth ?
yes i UNknown e heard of him
you think this guy 's him ?
sure it 's him !
how else would he get all that money ?
must have made a fortune in gold
it doesn 't make sense
listen here to the high UNknown expert
tell us what makes sense
i just figure any man who UNknown l risk his neck to save a dog 's life isn 't going to kill somebody for gold teeth
UNknown i want to talk to you
what really happened last night ?
i told you
i gotta know him so good i can taste him
now how did you get a rifle butt in your face without killing him ?
he shot first edgar !
honest to christ !
i expect that 's you
too damn crowded
now listen to me albert cause you ain 't got much time
things are not the same as when you left here
they put up a town about 7 years ago
just a few hours from here in good weather
there 's a UNknown outpost there and radios and newspapers come in from toronto almost regular
it 's different albert
i guess he UNknown l bring a whole bunch of others with him
but he 's the last man in the world that anybody 'd want on his trail
they 'r e gonna kill you
am i gettin through to you albert ?
i understand what you 'r e sayin
but you ain 't runnin that it ?
got no place to go
your father never had anything against running
i don 't guess anybody ever really wanted to catch up to him anyway
he 's gone isn 't he ?
he died in a prison hospital
where you headed ?
do some UNknown
tie those horses up
switch with me ned
it 's a deal
i don 't want any trouble and i don 't want to see nobody else get hurt !
i 'm coming in to talk to you !
now hear me out !
edgar what are you doing ?
if he wanted a fire fight he would have started
he ain 't crazy
you 'r e the one who 's crazy
you don 't look like a madman
you look like a UNknown
johnson we UNknown e got a bad situation out here
the dead body over there probably has your bullet in him
i have a pretty fair idea what happened out here
then leave me be
i have to take you in and clear this up
that 's the law
to you i 'm just a name on a form you have to fill out
i have a bunch of savages out here just aching to UNknown you all over the place
they don 't want your side at all
now if you don 't come in with me that 's all the excuse they UNknown l need
they UNknown l either kill you or get themselves killed tryin
i can 't let that happen
you can 't stop it
no i can 't
i UNknown l have you back out here in 3 days
i UNknown l guarantee your safety into town and back
but if you don 't come in
hold it !
you okay ?
i hope you sons of bitches can finish what you started
we gonna wait him out ?
we 'd run out of food or freeze before he does
he 's got too much mud on the cabin to burn him out
he 's cut firing UNknown about a foot above the floor
he UNknown l be on his belly
pass the word
pass it on
go get him charlie !
get UNknown m charlie !
break it in !
i UNknown l bury the guy !
holy shit !
but not in the fire
if you get popped and you drop that you know what happens
look at these hands
my mama bless her soul always said my hands were the best part of me
and your father said the best part of you ran down your mama 's leg
hope you can fuck better than you can play
i cooked up some fish for you fellas
what are you laughin at ?
i wasn 't laughing
try it asshole
maybe i UNknown l go tell him
hell of a way for a man to die being blown up
yeah be a good man to have on your side
too bad we got to kill the son of a bitch
johnson would have given himself up if he hadn 't been guilty of something
guess i was wrong about him
most would have run if they had the chance
a piece of ground can be mighty important to a man
surround the cabin and stay out of my way
let 's go !
son of a bitch !
he 's gone
we UNknown l need your dogs hazel
and enough supplies to stay out a couple of weeks
let 's go !
can 't be no normal man
no he 's a killer
just a man
huh UNknown ?
if i left now i 'd never know what it would have been like with you
i guess it 's up to me isn 't it ?
it 's been a long time now
you 'r e going to have to kick me out of here aren 't you ?
no it ain 't
damn it !
well then keep him the hell away from me
cut that out damn it !
let 's go !
what 's that mean ?
he 's got his UNknown on backwards
he 's laying 2 sets of tracks for us
the man is UNknown
let 's go
you see anything edgar ?
alright grab my UNknown
the way i hear it told hazel 's mama didn 't know if he was a boy or girl 't ill he was about 15
she didn 't much care a few years later when he turned vicious
like my dog
oh that 's right
we don 't get many pretty young white boys like you up here
only one thing you 'r e good for
leave me alone hazel
stop it !
with my plane in the air and my abilities as a flier albert johnson
i 'm UNknown a 500 reward for his capture !
my newspaper will match that offer dollar for dollar !
that 's 1 000 on the head of albert johnson !
let 's go get him !
i hope that bastard stays alive forever eh ?
let 's go !
where 's sergeant UNknown ?
you 'r e looking at him
i 'm captain hank tucker UNknown
i UNknown e come to bring the fugitive to justice !
where 's headquarters ?
special intelligence squad in the war
these pictures were taken for security
yes i read captain
i don 't have to remind you this is confidential information
who the hell we going to tell it to ?
volunteers will be arriving in a couple of days
then send them back
we don 't need anymore UNknown up here
they UNknown l be up here anyway
there 's a 1000 bounty on johnson
now that 's more like it
good god captain
we can use that manpower
to assist me in cutting him off before he gets in to that river chain
you really don 't know what 's going on do you ?
he 's not headed into the river chain
he 's going to UNknown his way up the sunshine pass to alaska
that 's impossible
well this one 's going to try
if he gets over that range he 's free
and neither you nor your plane can do anything about that
will you just listen ?
he doesn 't have to feed a large posse
in my plane UNknown is a mere 20 minutes away
my credentials are impeccable sergeant
they sent for me because i am the best !
now your superiors know what this is one big goddamn UNknown !
you UNknown e had your chance and your ground maneuvers have been an UNknown failure
this is page 1 news and it looks just awful !
face the fact sergeant
the future has arrived
i don 't want to see it
clarence if i get to johnson first i UNknown l give you half the reward
you get to him first you give me half the reward
that ain 't fair
i thought you was the mad UNknown for sure
you shouldn 't be UNknown up on guys like that bill
so you want to help us hunt johnson ?
you 'r e one of the best UNknown around
you need us bill
sure except UNknown hazel UNknown and and me
there 's a lot of gold in them teeth clarence
gold at 35 an ounce
what 's eating at you edgar ?
if anybody 's gonna bring albert johnson in it 's gonna be me
not some bounty hunter or fly boy UNknown for promotion
why you ?
he deserves me
he 's runnin with the UNknown trying to throw us off
his UNknown are gettin shorter
means he 's gettin tired
there he is !
i could have had him !
you 'r e in a hell of a hurry to kill !
he 's on the ridge !
he 's trapped !
we UNknown e got to bury him
don 't ever grab me
if we don 't bury him the dogs will eat him
kill the dogs i got a man to hunt
you got to make up your mind if you 'r e a priest or a UNknown
hold it !
now get back !
he UNknown l do the same to you !
now stay out of it !
the pure fact is he 's runnin to save his hide
and every man he killed he killed to protect himself
well what about hawkins and UNknown ?
what did any of them die for UNknown ?
johnson didn 't do anything i wouldn 't do if i was in his boots
and if i thought the killing would stop here i 'd let him go
my old man warned me never to trust you
i 'm going in after him
better check it out but be careful
go on !
what did you see up there ?
maybe i am too old eh ?
well what about johnson ?
as far as i 'm concerned that 's albert johnson
now you 'r e in charge
it 's up to you when the killing stops
he 's dead alright
he 's the goddamn mad UNknown !
who shot him ?
where is he ?
that 's real nice
i once was lost but now i 'm found
take you for instance
but i figure you must be lost
so i tell you what
see this here ?
and since you look like such a UNknown individual here 's the tip
find your ass out of here
we haven 't finished our drinks
you finished now ?
and don 't come back UNknown
po get them out of here !
casino 's as good a place as any
guess i could use a little exercise
guns don 't kill people
people kill people
lf they start blasting off ain 't none of y 'a ll going home !
you guys are disturbing my business
so if your ass ain 't black you 'd better get up out of here before it really get hot !
let 's go
get them out
we 'r e in a damn war
i 'm a big boy now
these black guys UNknown l bury you

hey look all i want to know is when does colin o 'd ay get to run with the show ?
don 't worry baby
these things are never easy
what you want me to say ?
go to hell
you 'r e as responsible as the people who did this to my brother
don 't come near me
i hate you
that was my boy mac
i won 't pretend i know what you 'r e feeling
but i know you gotta keep it UNknown up until business is done
the people who did this l promise you on my life they UNknown l be knocked out of the box in due time
i UNknown l make sure of it
what happened ?
he hid out front while i ran to tell my mom he 'd been hurt
hit by a car or something really bad like that
when she came he was supposed to jump out
you know surprise her and we 'd all fall out and have this great laugh
me and my mom always loved a good laugh
i was about or 9
colin was like 1 1
i don 't remember how we came up with it but sure enough i start screaming and yelling
and my mom runs out of the house
she 's like UNknown what 's wrong ?
when i told her i mean
the look on her face
even when colin popped up to show it was a joke she couldn 't stop crying
she just held him close
UNknown him you know ?
i was just a baby
i didn 't get it then but i get it now
i 'm sorry
gentlemen we are ready to approach the UNknown
i don 't think any of the other bids are even in contention
our package is staggering
god himself couldn 't have designed a better spot for a stadium
that 's right
i don 't get it
these are waterfront properties
yeah but why ?
ls anybody here ?
ln america if a girl 's kicking your ass you don 't have to be a gentleman
yeah no doubt
i guess they strange like that
some brothers strange like that too
as soon as one of us move up a crab motherfucker like yourself pulls us right back down
but let me tell you something
this place seems like a piece of shit to you but that 's still my piece of shit
and i ain 't selling it
i got work to do
let 's look at it another way
you got two choices

you heard about victor ho ?
we 'r e looking forward to some UNknown
that 's why we 'r e here
we got a tip this place will get hit
you gotta be kidding me
my dear brothers when you expire your territory will remain within the collective
of course since i alone survive the collective is in UNknown only me
you don 't want to be in my path when my feet are put to the coals
misery loves company
may i suggest UNknown ?
i hope you have some good news for me
there 's no need for threats or UNknown
none of us want to drag this out any longer than it already has
then close out your business and get me those deeds

you lost your mind thinking whites would let you own a piece of their game
me and ch UNknown had an understanding
anybody who didn 't sign those deeds we took care of
what do you mean ?
he shot them
so now after everything you really gonna try to do this ?
i have been covering your ass for years UNknown
quite frankly i am just tired of being your boy
just because you put your kids through college that 's supposed to make all of your crooked straight ?
man you want to own a damn box
mac just want to own the streets
that 's always been your problem
what about colin ?
i guess old UNknown green couldn 't fly

english subtitles by UNknown UNknown
you 'r e UNknown
you know spies a bunch of UNknown little girls
just giving you a little taste of what i woke up to this morning bro
i was dragged out of bed by someone very interested in you
by all means
i 'm gonna start thinking you like me
oh you remember my partner detective lopez
i 'm not sure you two formally met
i 'm glad you 'r e here
i got a gift for you
my daily activity log
just a way to say thank you for chatting to us about his big brother
and i thought it wouldn 't hurt to see if you were free today to answer some questions
i 'm crazy busy
then i was planning on working out
well until your calendar clears up just know i 'm gonna make my way through every friend relative and associate you have
let me save you some time
my friends and family don 't know anything
sooner or later someone will
when you want this to stop
how long you been in town ?
about six hours five of which were spent
listening to your girlfriend over there tell me that i 'd fled to vegas to avoid some UNknown parking tickets
she was just trying to soften you up trying to get you to flip on me
jesus bro i didn 't say anything all right ?
but do you know how hard it is not to talk about your UNknown activities ? all right
drive me to mom 's
my car is there
this is real
help me out ?
if there 's one thing nate UNknown knows how to do it 's avoid telling the truth
well that 's good news for now
but how long before UNknown finds someone you know that she can flip like a gun runner named seymour ?
or a money UNknown named barry ?
or a washed up navy seal named sam ?
or how about an unstable jealous
not a bad idea
i 'm thinking a financial relationship something that looks very suspicious but isn 't actually illegal
well nice to see you too
although i thought you 'd still be running from those angry south americans
but not just me
doesn 't nate look happy ?
closing his little deal
brought him over special just for this
UNknown if you
it 's not up to me
whether nate 's meeting ends in a bullet or a handshake is entirely up to you
see you 'r e gonna be running some errands for me today
just think of me as uh
your new boss
i want to see those pretty eyes
let 's go
is this little job of yours time sensitive ?
listen to you
you are a sly one aren 't you ?
you know you could save me some time
you could tell me what we 'r e doing
keys don 't need to know what 's behind the doors they unlock
now rules for the UNknown
i give orders you obey
you try to escape nate dies
fail to complete a task nate dies
refuse an order
michael we covered this
prove nate 's alive now or your project ends here
well how about this ?
prove to me i 'm not wasting my time
my partner is a man who really enjoys his work yeah it 's me
put our friend on
uh i UNknown e got a few errands to run but you can work out the broad strokes with my partner
be careful though buddy he can be ruthless once he starts to work you over
yeah no i 'm looking forward to the challenge
so this is the house and now you 'r e living here
with his mom ?
i 'm just helping out with some home repairs
it 's not like that
you got here fast barry
oh yeah yeah
anyway so michael 's got a cop problem ?
yeah it 's making life unpleasant for all of us
we need a little help to make it go away
my life coach has strongly suggested that i try and avoid UNknown situations
barry we 'r e not asking you to storm the station
just open a joint bank account with mike
and a mayor 's aide great
why don 't we just throw a judge in there while we 'r e at it ?
barry we called you because this cop isn 't just our problem
she 's UNknown everybody in mike 's life
you really want to find out what questions she has for his dear old money UNknown pal barry ?
here 's what you 'r e gonna do
go here and tell fabian that i 'm giving you the portable UNknown
yeah uh say barry before you and your hands get too busy
i thought maybe you could help me out with a little home improvement project
so who 's the guy with the purse ?
that 's barry
he 's sam 's financial consultant
now you got to hold it up
hold it in position
hold that down
there 's a hardware key in a desk in office 237
in about a half an hour it 's gonna be in my pocket
this gets you past security
besides the guards there should be nobody in the building on a sunday
i hope you know more about the building than my jacket size
UNknown you got bigger things to worry about than how pretty you look in your coat
the offices are wired to the building 's alarms
you ready ?
if you 'r e not going to tell me what we 'r e doing here
UNknown just eat what 's on your plate
one more thing
as long as you remember what really matters here
i don 't get what i want and your brother dies
now run along
oh nothing just part of the process
barry you 'r e gonna have to start bringing the second man to this two man job
no no no it 's fine
very sturdy wood and uh glass yeah ?
remember UNknown ?
yeah he 's back and he 's threatening to kill nate unless i steal something for him some kind of high tech equipment
uh hey why don 't you show UNknown our progress and i UNknown l be right back ?
are you ok ?
that 's all i know
what can i do ?
i just hacked UNknown 's cell
i e mailed you everything on it
i need you to comb through the addresses text messages and phone calls
you want to know what UNknown 's after ?
i want to know everything
i want to know who his buyer is where he 's got nate what brand of orange juice he drinks in the morning
i 'm on it
UNknown 's got the UNknown brothers fitted for body bags
it just tipped over
are you trying to pull something ? no

no i only do the UNknown so i
what the hell is this ?
i was picking up glass and i cut myself
ok what 's your name ?
and i 'm gonna get a vacuum and i 'm gonna clean this up
johnny no hey hey hey you 'r e gonna stay right here
whenever there 's an alarm we have to call the police
it 's building procedure
no listen you don 't have to do that !
it 's simple glass !
it fell !
don 't lie to me
i can smell it on you
no no wait
this job is all i got and if i miss a child support payment my ex is gonna take the kids to UNknown with her boyfriend
so i messed up
look you call somebody to pick you up
that i feel the need to appear powerful and UNknown ?
i see you 'r e still a sharp dresser
is that UNknown ?
it 's already pretty well established that i like nice things
and pretty things
you 'r e boring me
the guy in that house has a voice
you have a voice recorder
you 'r e gonna put the two together
you want to be a little more specific ?
do you want his favorite bible verses UNknown rap ?
full name and every number zero through nine
someone 's making a voice key
ding ding michael UNknown
actually i understand he 's a bit of a gun nut which means he 's less likely to call the cops and more likely to just shoot you
so good luck with that
do you have a car repair kit ?
this cat ran right in front of me
yeah well the cat cost you 2 grand
are you trying to get out of this ?
no no no man
and i left my UNknown in my jacket
can i use you can use mine
that 's great thanks

it 's a 45 and no
it 's a luger
i thought you wanted to use the phone
where 'd you go m i t ?
i graduated 1 9 UNknown
what 'd you have like a 4 0 ?
hey do you want me to get the phone for you ?
it 's carver and it 's three oh five
three zero five ?
yes three zero five !
will you stop interrupting me ?
that is an international transfer charge that means that UNknown 's moved money wait
i just finished stealing a hardware key with an agency UNknown code
sounds like UNknown 's after some government UNknown weapon
how are we doing on the information from UNknown 's phone ?
well could be better
i mean this weasel 's pretty careful
UNknown his text messages
what about his call log ?
UNknown placed a bunch of calls to UNknown bank and trust
he used his phone to enter his pin
so barry got into his account ?
look for any rent or mortgage payments
if UNknown 's got a place in miami there 's a good bet nate 's there
what are you trying to pull ?
that sure as hell ain 't your insurance company
let me take this for you
i 'm sorry
can i give it to you ?
fi where you been ?
ok i need you to meet me right now
i UNknown l be there in 10
look i don 't know who you are
i don 't know what you think you 'r e doing
but you 'r e done lying to me
hang on ! no !
that car is eight inches from the curb and it 's supposed to only be six inches from the curb !
what are you talking about ?
six inches ? !
it 's in the middle of the street !
say it 's eight inches from the curb !
say it !
i will !
just admit it
your car is eight inches from the curb
say it !
it 's eight inches all right ?
such an ugly word
gray about yea big
for our purposes it couldn 't matter less
if you want me to go in there it couldn 't matter more
anything could be in that box
i 'm not handing over a UNknown to save one life even if it is my brother 's
look you want me to fetch you UNknown l tell me what 's in the box and where it 's headed
i 'm pretty sure i can get you to go get it without telling you a damn thing yeah what 's up ?
put him on
hey hey nate
are you one of those people who agrees to see a job through and then UNknown ?
no of course not
it makes me crazy
it makes me want to kill someone
mr davis trust me i wouldn 't waste your time
life is too short
stay on the line
mr UNknown ?
but there 's only one thing that gets me into that building
it 's not a UNknown
it 's a UNknown lock for advanced infantry weapons
people will go on killing each other in little wars all around the globe whether or not you steal it
the only difference is how much money i make while they do it
a two man security team
unfortunately you can 't go around them
you UNknown e got to go through them
looks like i 'm gonna need that tire iron again
i like where your head is at UNknown
yeah i work on the third floor and i 'm trying to get to my car in the garage but the power is out
one of the guards went into the electrical room but it 's been a while and it 's still dark down here
i UNknown l be right there
second story back door
this beer is still cold
yeah mike ?
we 'r e at UNknown 's
did you find nate ?
bad news mike
we 'r e out of time sam
look this is not over
i UNknown l call barry again
we UNknown l check for any addresses we might have missed
we 'r e gonna find him
seriously it 's not a problem
you know i feel the same way
if we 'r e gonna be business partners we got to get to know each other
you know what i mean ?
we got to be um
like brothers ?
you know nate
nate you 'r e here to discourage stupid decisions and to show that i don 't make idle threats
a lot of soft tissue damage but it doesn 't usually kill
you didn 't need to do that
actually i did
you just had to know what was in the box so i just had to show you who was in charge
now assuming you can read a map just follow that red line right to my new beach house
hardware key gets you into the r d area
carver 's voice recognition gets you into the lab
i cut it together while you were playing with the guards
he needs to get to a hospital
you nicked an artery
otherwise i 'm switching to lead
shot him ? !
it was just UNknown 's version of a pep talk
sam if we don 't find something to use against UNknown
i 'm gonna have to give him what he wants
you give UNknown what he wants chances are he UNknown l kill you both
i 'm running out of options sam
is there anything that we missed ?
what else ?
this UNknown international some s UNknown looks like a tax shelter
tell me about UNknown international
well it 's more like a russian UNknown doll than a company
you know i dug through nine UNknown in six countries
all i got was belle anna holding out of UNknown
he sends UNknown every 6 months it looks like
a lot of work to hide 80 grand a year
yeah no kidding
mike that 's it
mike you still there ?
he had a tie clip
looked like a gift
belle anna holding ?
you think or you know ?
somewhere in between
well it 's fi mike
you got to ask ?
can you walk barry through UNknown a call in 10 minutes ?
that 's gonna be tight but yeah sure
sounds like you UNknown e got something good mike
this is just outside of my comfort zone ok ?
i 'm just saying i 'm not that great with british UNknown !
there 's no other way barry
mike 's counting on you
yeah yeah ok
well enough to make a point
but not kill the neighbors
was i UNknown about the situation here ?
no you were very clear
i had the box in my hands then i decided you never will
you told me to make a point
take your picture
i i 'm through playing games UNknown
i think you got a text message
it can wait
it 's your house i believe
you did this ?
oh that 's not all
since we last met i became an expert on tyler UNknown
i know everything about you from where you get your teeth cleaned to where you do your banking
i probably wouldn 't believe me either
UNknown bank and trust has some fine security
but if you want to make a quick phone call put your mind at ease i UNknown l wait
yes i need to check my balance
account number UNknown pin UNknown
local time 261 000 was transferred out of this account
your current balance is 4
if you like no
you know what ?
what about belle anna ?
i mean UNknown ?
you son of a bitch
honey i i 'm sorry
i forgot uh
you you go back to sleep ok pumpkin ?
i UNknown l call you tomorrow
this isn 't you UNknown
you 'r e capable of a lot but you wouldn 't hurt a child
but you would UNknown
why not just
you 'r e lying
if she so much as skins her knee on the playground
i swear to god UNknown
i will spend the rest of my life destroying you and everything you love
of course you will UNknown
she 's your family
yeah you owe me a christmas card
um it 's ok
what 'd you tell mom ?
i told her i was attacked by a UNknown
i didn 't want her to get scared
you thinking about sticking around for a while ?
i don 't know
you know i thought i was here to land this big deal and
nate i know it 's hard sometimes being my brother
it 's ok bro

i 'm just glad both of my boys are home
and that i got to know barry
he 's coming over later with some new UNknown UNknown hair UNknown

i screw up his life better than he does
oh don 't be so hard on yourself
he wouldn 't be breathing if it weren 't for you
i had a little help
detective you look unhappy
oh detective lopez ? no
he 's been suspended
he 's been doing his job actually
he grilled a mayor 's aide for three hours about some mysterious bank account she opened with a michael UNknown
turned out to be a bank error but not before the mayor got upset enough to have his badge yanked
that 's too bad

cell phone ringing faint
fire call signal rings blares
there 's a fire in the orleans savings and loan
in the memory chip of the phone you 'r e holding are the numbers of two security deposit boxes located on the 10th floor
to win simply grab those boxes by 5 55 exactly or there 's gonna be an early knockout
you gotta be UNknown me
uh not enough time
they just think they found the van that miles used to take molly
i 'm gonna go back and set up a war room all right ?
you okay ?
all right ?
when have i ever let you down before ?
this is inspector george UNknown
we understand that miles jackson 's UNknown in the area
what 'd you just say ?
the guy breaks out of prison f b i knows about it and nobody tells me ?
we understand that you 'r e upset danny it was none of your business
you can keep on crying about what you did and didn 't know or you can tell us everything that happened this morning since you woke up
that is if you want your girl back
engine two let 's move out
danny you catching a ride ?
we 'r e your best chance danny
tell us what we wanna know we UNknown l tell you what you wanna know
siren wailing horn blowing
miles and the inmates took the guards killed the warden and demanded 30 cars to drive out of the prison
and you gave them to them ?
wasn 't exactly our choice danny
the bureau gave them cars with kill switches and remote door locks
the inmates get three blocks away from the yard national guard comes in puts everyone back in their cells
everyone except miles
you 'r e killing me with the whining
you have no idea what you 'r e up against do you ?
i know you arrested him but you still don 't know
the fact miles jackson has your girlfriend mmm that interests me very little
the fact that he 's done something that he never does the fact that he 's shown himself in the city that interests me quite a bit more
you wanna catch miles ?
that 's fine
just stay the hell out of my way
i guess he didn 't hear me about the whining
sir this is exactly what miles wants
we should stop danny before somebody gets hurt
if danny keeps playing the game miles is distracted
miles is distracted he might make a mistake and i UNknown l bury him
come on !
smoke on 10 guys
let 's go !
come on guys
we need every security camera every possible witness every vehicle plate number
this asshole calls again i wanna know where he is
i wanna know what he 's doing
i wanna find him before he so much as thinks about touching one hair on her head
this could be your girlfriend could be your wife
could be any one of us
eh danny ?
you now have less than seven minutes to cross the 23 city blocks between here and the UNknown street wharf
arrive at the wharf any later the bomb goes off
the other box contains the clue to the next round
see in your time UNknown you might wanna use the fire truck for this one
seven minutes ?
that 's if we take the stairs
what are you doing ?
get them all out of the building !
you got gloves ?
make sure she 's safe
i don 't want this guy havin another chance
anchor this down
man shouting indistinct
they 'r e moving out now !

we can 't even pull a number to start a trace
i 'm driving a fire truck

i gotta go !
yo hey !
i 'm here
oh you 'r e finally starting to get the hang of this
i wanna speak to molly
how about i do you one better ?
how about i show her to you ?
as i said the clue to the next round is in the box you so UNknown hung on to
you put two and two together you might have quite the reunion
tell me you didn 't kill anybody with that thing
i need a saw
it 's clear
we switched out your UNknown card
we 'r e tapped into your phone
we can track you wherever you go
miles will call again danny
when he does keep him on the line for 30 seconds
that 's all we need
miles 's phone 's UNknown
you can 't trace it
that 's funny
all we need is 30 seconds
all teams listen up listen up !
we have a location
i need swat and i need k 9 and i need all of you there
secure the street
i need snipers on the roof
shut down all communication in and out of the building and start with the dogs
ray pull the UNknown
where 's your control room ?
where are you ?
it was like 30 minutes ago
he 's writing something down
we 'r e still here
all the exits are locked down
stand by for location
they 'r e leading him somewhere
who is that ?
show me everything
last week in lafayette left a dummy address
we 'r e tracking the i d on the security deposit boxes and known accomplices but so far nothing
what are we missing ?
this guy doesn 't plan everything and not leave a trail
let 's go over the prison break again
but miles is the only one who escapes
how many of these guys got into cars but wound up back in their cells ?
get me the warden on the phone
you got it
it goes all the way to the basement
i UNknown l meet you there
hey sorry if i did something wrong before
this guy he had all the right papers
said he was here to service the air conditioning
it 's okay
one of the oldest in the city
said he 'd go the rest of the way on his own
take me there
there 's no sign of miles
so where 's fisher ?
there 's supposed to be a phone there right ?
i 'm sure you UNknown e met your new friend willie
at the conclusion of this message you UNknown l have 60 seconds
before the elevator free falls to the ground
with 60 seconds limited resources
and willie 's unfortunate UNknown
there 's only time for one of you to survive
who lives and who dies that is your decision
for the lucky the clue to round 7 is framed in the lobby
for the other at least you UNknown l be a lot thinner
danny he made me read this to you
is that for real man ?
i can 't die
where 's the security hatch ?
i got a radio
you gonna leave me here ?
shit i can 't fit through there
all right big man let 's go

i just watched a man die and i don 't even know if molly 's still alive
excuse me ?
there 's nothin to figure danny
is the f b i tryin to trace this call ?
tsk tsk tsk
then it was the f b i
george UNknown and all his wonderful little toys ?

so how about i call you again in two minutes ?
would that give you ample time to grieve ?
it 's working just fine
if danny keeps doing this a lot more people are gonna get hurt
cell phone ringing
what the hell you think you 'r e doin ?
listen to me for a second all right danny ?
willie can be the last person who has to die today
answer the goddamn phone
shut up !
well done danny
that 's all that counts right ?
how very true but it 's time to see you play for yourself for a change
be at the location in the photo in 10 minutes
you come alone and you UNknown l have a 50 50 chance of having the time of your life
we 'r e more than halfway through danny
and i UNknown e got a little bit of a surprise for ya
it 's not in your pay grade
santiago on radio
what do you see ?
he said 10 minutes danny
it 's been 10
we got you covered
tell me you UNknown e got something
i got a pissed off member of the black liberation army is what i got
miles had him kill a couple guards during the prison break and then left the brother behind to take the fall
when can you get him to talk ?
soon as i get the judge to sign the warrant
give me 10 minutes
miles 's voice
it 's the bus
i 'm gonna get you out of this
just stay calm molly
all teams we have a confirmation
miles jackson is on the bus
proceed with op 2 delta and get me a sniper team out here now
we stop that bus now he turns this into a UNknown
we know where he is
we 'r e takin our shot
alpha 1 set up and prepare to stop the target
round 7 danny
i 'm aiming for the right atrium but we UNknown l see what happens
thirty seconds later after she 's dead a second larger charge will explode and they UNknown l be cleaning everyone up off this bus in pieces
i just like to play the game
i didn 't mean for erica to die
i don 't think that matters
that 's the one i want
set up on the 10 UNknown
swat team this is agent santiago
take position at the north on the UNknown UNknown at UNknown
miles let her go
well i 'm afraid if i let molly go danny you won 't play the game
look at those eyes
why did miles ask to meet me here ?
fuck you !
yeah there is
she 's a UNknown one isn 't she ?
set up section one
what if i don 't believe you ?
pick everybody up in pieces ?
miles that bomb blows you die too
what 's keeping me from reaching over there and kicking the shit out of you ?
cause you 'r e UNknown danny
you think i 'm lyin ?
sir that 's a 75 yard shot through a moving bus window
one sniper 's gotta break the glass another one 's gotta get the hit
you sure this is how you wanna do this ?
team delta prepare for visual
teams bravo and charlie hold for extract once shots are fired

i 'm just gonna ask you to let me help you
we do this together we can both get what we want
let me help you
choose poorly and the number you dial will arm one of four devices scattered throughout the city
you now have 60 seconds
if you refuse to dial in that UNknown time all four will be UNknown and you UNknown l have yourself quite an adventure
that doesn 't make any sense
it 's gotta be a code then
the first one 's city hall
danny we got less than 10 seconds
we got three numbers left
you gotta pick one
very shortly streetcar 907 will enter the downtown area on canal street
you UNknown e just UNknown the brakes and the communication radio
your task is simply stop the streetcar before it UNknown through the end of the line and everything else in its path
let 's take that one
i have an emergency
keep following the 10
my name is special agent ray santiago of the f b i
i need to talk to somebody that can help brakes squealing
she put me on hold
pick up the phone !
is there anyone there that can help us make this decision ?
shut down the power
can 't you guys just shut down the power ?
this is not a prank phone call
man on radio
we got four units waiting around the corner
people chattering laughing
how fast you think that thing 's goin ?
30 tons of metal going downhill ?
do you want me to take him ?
let 's see where he 's going
phelps and i will follow him
aren 't we going too fast ?
i think we 'd better hang on

why don 't you guys go ahead and do that
what are you gettin soft on me ?
how about you give me something that 's gonna be a challenge ?
you sound pretty pleased with yourself danny
hank pick up
it 's going to voice mail
you all right ?
i got somebody on the phone
i 'm trying to get you a straight answer
nobody 's got anything
miles knew about it
i hear what you 'r e sayin
it 's been a half hour
there are UNknown on the scene now but hank was inside
there 's no way he could UNknown e made it
i 'm sorry
miles stole three UNknown from a u s military shipment in iraq
we tracked him to pakistan
but the day the deal went down
i lost miles and i lost the guns
two days later one of those UNknown shot down a UNknown out of UNknown
this was the only thing i could find intact in the rubble
what i 'm saying is i made a mistake here
i forgot why i carry this
this isn 't about miles
this is about the people he 's hurt and the ones he 's gonna hurt
guys i 'm never gonna see her again
don 't say that
and i know miles better than any person alive
let me help you
the pipes the pipes are calling ???
sorry about the delay danny
but i think that we 'r e just about ready for our grand finale
it is round 12 and this time we won 't be goin to the judges UNknown
in 17 minutes it will be exactly one year since erica 's death and i have to ask will molly suffer a similar fate ?
miles you don 't have to do this
now all you have to do is find her
she has a touch phone strapped to her chest along with some other more explosive items
except this time only your UNknown only your touch can stop the timer
tell me where she is
are you sorry for what you UNknown e done ?
yes miles i 'm sorry
then perhaps maybe you should pay her a visit tell her so yourself
it 's been fun danny but game over
pay erica a visit ?
it 's the cemetery
where is she buried ?
i need you to pull the cemetery records of all orleans parish
this is ray santiago of the f b i
i need a police escort
we are canal and royal heading out of the c b d
i 'm the only one that can UNknown that bomb
we know danny
they 'r e arriving now but remember this is miles
the cemetery might just be the first step
cell phone ringing
if he wanted to kill us he should UNknown e done it when he had the chance
danny your phone
i ran a trace on all five numbers from earlier
they were all connected to the device under the streetcar
all five numbers
we pulled the UNknown
you still had five seconds to save willie
like i said it was the last thing hank had me working on but
willie was always gonna die
what are you talking about ?
miles had security cameras in the elevator
saw i was gonna save him and blew the charge early
and all those numbers all five of them were connected to the same streetcar
you already told me once george
i arrested this guy
this is your guy
he wants to win
the deal with samuel and joshua
he went to a lot of trouble to get some revenge
but what else did we find in the car ?
he 's had molly for over three and a half hours
not once has he mentioned ransom
this isn 't about revenge
it is about the money
ray give me all the information we got on the security guard from the hotel
i 'm pickin up his shift
for one second we UNknown e just gotta stop and think
today what did i actually do ?
does this even matter ?
you 'r e still the only one who can UNknown that bomb
he took my house
what else happened at the hotel ?
he blew the gas lines
they evacuated three city blocks
three city blocks ?
i had to stop the streetcar
no no no
after UNknown when the power was out all over the city
UNknown security comes in to move all the unprotected cash
wait a second
that 's the goddamn mint
our backup generator 's gonna run out at midnight
fed 's been pullin all the old hundreds and UNknown out of circulation
that 's the entire southeast UNknown
total 's just over 100 million ?
hey ray you go with swat to the mint and you shut everything down all cars all UNknown
you stop it and you lock it in the quarter
we got eight minutes to get you to the cemetery
don 't you want miles ?
not till we get molly
tell me something
miles isn 't gettin anywhere
miles 's voice
molly 's at the cemetery
everything i did today had a purpose
from the time molly walked out the door there isn 't a thing i did today that miles didn 't plan
he makes sure i wreck the fire truck so he could steal it
he threatens my brother so i 'm not thinking straight
he shows me molly to keep me in the game
it 's obvious
i need to speak with hospital security
woman on p a

UNknown UNknown i can feel you ?? ??

given their status tu les UNknown for next to nothing
it is a brave boy
he said perhaps the truth
if it does not pay soon i broke the skull
i would find another husband
kill him yes and thou shalt have more orders
UNknown we ask
i have searched everywhere
i am responsible for him
now it is my cup
and the lady
let 's talk about your last report
the band of devil 's lair was stopped
you think they are nervous and our index is silent
who told you that ?
the head ?
there was something in the air
you 'r e there to bring the facts
not to sniff the air
and these nonsense about a white man who claims to be the UNknown of an african leader ?
why white ?
it is UNknown ?
yes i think
he wants to be entrusted with the case
things will remain there ?
i just look UNknown
well i am not quite convinced but there is sufficient evidence
you are now a civilian
then let me do
i will be until the day where you UNknown dragged me to the altar
put your business in the pen
sally and i are going to the cottage
why have you given the service this wild bloodthirsty ?
our cottage will it be like that one day ?
it is only the beginning
i will kill them all
these damn politicians !
this is nonsense
i never stole anything
i battle with it
i will die of old age or a shot whatever
serve me a cognac
what it is to do everything ourselves
brick laying cut wood
nobody helped me except UNknown
UNknown it 's good for your blood
my blood pressure goes very well !
i 'm lame not deaf
when i crossed the road UNknown 15 shillings in my pocket and all my possessions in a cart
you have all made
i have led a hard life ?
thank you to remember !
but he was never charged
i was not so sure
but it is no longer there
as your brothers
so beware UNknown
the herd is safe the pen is calm and all farmers have returned
very well UNknown
let me finish my glass
who do you take ?
my nanny ?
empty your cup !
i 'm taking a big sip
a very large !
let 's deal
tout va bien ?
moi non plus
i tell him all the time

i was sent to protect you
and if we solved it by a game ?
i take the head of foreign and you that of english

i 'm sorry

we will capture these men
they will do what they did mrs
the man in the camp he spoke of an UNknown
UNknown line outside
in a mood massacre
gentlemen from now on you will be subject to the same that the discipline involved
you should not act by revenge
i know what you feel
but one false step would destroy what has taken years to build
power trust and respect for africans
these acts of UNknown are UNknown to make you lose your calm
i warn you

i know this place
when we part mambo ?
how do you know ?
this was reluctant UNknown all day
take UNknown and his youngest son with you
we two that 's enough
UNknown would only hinder us
it is old but he hunted with me before your birth
you will need all the help you can find
it is old but it held the road
take it i feel to be with you
a short range shooting and this will be cut in half
your son and you send you behind this rock
do not shoot before my signal

and him ?
en route mambo
they wore another man

his excellence can well see that the car is black but is it also extremely fast ?
his excellence would prefer that i 'm the one who drives
later he thinks he UNknown l show him the vehicle
it would be better if it 's you who shows it to his excellence and the ambassador
i 'm not the driver
you UNknown e driven it with such ability despite it being your first time
i 'm just his secretary
we wouldn 't do any better believe me
here is my card
a telephone call will suffice
you owed me 200 for the mercedes plus this 500 it makes 700
is it a deal ?
it 's a gift !
take what you want !
the only thing left is this lousy wallet
take it as a gift
what for ?
i 'm not convinced
do you have a big deal ?
no i 'm done nothing more
will you drive the UNknown back ?
can 't you do it by yourself ?
no this morning i ve too many appointments
hurry up !
come on get lost
wait a moment

if you 'r e frightened by oscar i UNknown l put a muzzle on him
she is deaf and he 's UNknown

well done do a good deed
i don 't know if it 's oscar that 's too small or his little coat that 's too big but in any case it hurts
give it to mrs van de put
do you think he has UNknown ?
no i don 't think so unless mrs van de put has bitten him
does it burn ?

it 's the car who pays
this sausage is very good we UNknown l come back

are you paul UNknown re ?
may i ask you a question ?
how did you get your first car for your first rally ?
i don 't remember any more
i did it somehow
yes this one is not mine and i haven 't money to rent one
i can 't wait to drive in this rally
you caught me a little unaware
don 't you have a friend whom you can ask for money ?
give me some advice
i put in it all my
i don 't know how to explain
the hard part is to achieve results to be successful to compete at a high level to be a name
can 't you help me at all ?
don 't you know what i could do ?
the rally begins the day after tomorrow
no but i wish you could manage it
good luck !
your friend told me everything !
you are a bastard !
let me go !
you want the number plate ?
go and get it !
i don 't care at all about the plate
i could go in jail !
now return the car soon
go away !
i UNknown l arrive first
has the selection already be done ?
yes the list of who is UNknown is over there
i have applied with a UNknown i ve number 9
i 'd like to know if it s possible to change vehicle
you have to maintain the same category
look it 's badly parked and its brakes don 't work
may i start in a UNknown or a jaguar ?
with one of these two ?
yes i wanted to know just in case
if it 's just in case have your brakes repaired
you are the cause of the crash then you blame the others !
that 's not true !
i saw you !
you know ?
he drives around with that old crock !
he cut me up !
it was you !
get off !
its brakes are filthy
do you want a nut ?
for heaven 's sake !
how long should i wait ?
actually it 's the same wherever you go
just think !
has burnt your hair ?
that 's a shame !
by the way some days ago a UNknown caught fire
20 people died
if you read it in a newspaper
it said that someone was naked
and i read that someone caught a cold
they were sleeping
what do you think about washing my hair ?
i think of my mum
and are you always thinking of her ?
i 'm not here for thinking
when you think something what do you think ?
let it remain between you and me
i 'm always thinking about cars
that 's better !
and so what ?
if it absolutely has to be a UNknown there are three UNknown
buy one rent one things that seem to be ruled out or being kind to someone who owns one
how much does it cost to rent one ?
you 'd better telephone someone who owns a UNknown
this way madam
it wasn 't a tip it was the address of a UNknown
i 'm calling for the renting of a UNknown
no it 's just for a few days
how much is the rental ?
is it the same for just one day ?
that 's impossible !
are you crazy ?

nobody has forced you
come on give me a sausage !
you want a sausage ?
then UNknown the tyres
those people gave me money to buy your sausages
i UNknown e come here as you asked
this is my private mode of transport it 's quite responsive
it 's much faster than a UNknown in the traffic
come here !
you prefer the old ones
those with a big belly
come on get in !
we are closing !
did you get the catalogue ?
there is one in the boot
here it is !
and so ?
if you had told me so i would have thought you were crazy
miss i invite you to pass the evening in the boot of a car

do you know where the brake pedal is ?
i also know where the UNknown is

because with a UNknown it
do you hope i will add a UNknown behind your number plates ?
i didn 't ask you for anything
was it by chance that we met at the fashion show ?
or was it by chance that you had the wig with you ?
you know with chance sometimes it 's lucky others not
this time it wasn 't unlucky
this was your plan !
you smile and when she asks you what you want you answer
i requested a UNknown but i just have the number plates
please may i ask you to take me back to the fashion show because down there there is a a friend with a car
how much do you need ?

this momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of negro slaves who had been UNknown in the flames of UNknown injustice
it came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity
but one hundred years later the negro still is not free
the life of the negro is still sadly crippled by the UNknown of UNknown and the chains of discrimination
one hundred years later the negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity
one hundred years later the negro is still UNknown in the corners of american society

mad dog is finished

you killed him
i saw you kill a little boy for oranges
how do you know i killed a boy for oranges ?
it wasn 't for oranges i killed him
he fired at my pickup and was trying to escape
we captured him in the old town
i asked him what was in his bucket
he said bananas and i kicked the bucket and it was oranges
he tried to escape and i killed the man
lf i had met him on the front he would have killed me too
was he your brother ?
so who says when they don 't need you they won 't get rid of you ?
you like it ?
it 's beautiful
i don 't need your gift
you go to school
can 't you read ?
you go to sunday church to worship jesus christ ?
you 'r e a virgin !
and you ?
i only need to pick one
UNknown is not the same as loving
you 'r e not talking ?
you started the talking talk now
now you 'r e scared
i thought you were brave
people simply called me nameless
with no family name to live up to i devoted myself to the sword
i spent ten years UNknown unique skills as a swordsman
the king of qin has summoned me to court for what i have accomplished has astonished the kingdom
by order of his majesty we have travelled overnight to bring the warrior to see you prime minister
sky snow and broken sword
for ten years these three assassins from zhao have repeatedly plotted to kill his majesty so he has not known a single peaceful night 's sleep
t UNknown we discover that a hero from our great kingdom of qin has single UNknown wiped out the enemy
from now on his majesty can once more sleep without fear !
his majesty 's UNknown congratulate him
heaven has sent a great warrior to UNknown the assassins !
by his majesty 's command summon the warrior !
when you enter the palace always remain one hundred paces from the throne or you will be killed without question
please do not forget !
for ten years no one 's approached within one hundred paces of the throne
do you know why ?
assassins were everywhere
now that you have rooted out this evil on our behalf what do you desire as a reward ?
t o rid great qin of its enemies is my duty
i desire no reward
sky 's silver spear has wounded UNknown numbers of our brave qin warriors
pronounce my edict !
advance within twenty paces of the throne and drink with his majesty !
according to my UNknown you are a citizen of qin
your humble servant nameless prefect of lan UNknown district
a mere local prefect !
with authority over no more than ten square miles !
this is the lowest rank of office in our kingdom
what UNknown you to overcome the three deadly assassins from zhao ?
i dealt with them one at a time
tell me in detail
indeed i have
three years without words ?
why was that ?
broken sword took this to heart
why have i not heard about this ?
it took your servant much effort to uncover this secret
t o create a UNknown between snow and broken sword i had first to dispose of sky
i am beginning to fathom your strategy
your majesty is most UNknown
what did you use to defeat sky ?
on the fifth day of the sixth month sky appeared in a chess house
i had heard that he was a lover of chess and music and was a frequent visitor
the seven elite guards from qin court
we have been trailing you for days
you are under arrest !
reveal your weapon and identify yourself !
this region is under my control !
i am here to arrest you !
sir would you be kind enough to play us another tune ?
martial arts and music share the same principles
both wrestle with complex chords and rare UNknown
we stood facing each other for a long time neither of us made a move while our combat UNknown in the depths of our minds
how swift your sword must be !
i UNknown myself in knowing every corner of our land
yet i was unaware that within the small district of lan UNknown there is such a talent like you
he who UNknown either one of them is awarded 1 0 thousand pieces of gold and authority over 5000 UNknown
advance within ten paces and drink with his majesty !
three years ago snow and broken sword stormed our palace together
three thousand soldiers were unable to resist them
i have since had this great hall emptied so there is nowhere to hide !
are you saying that your sword was UNknown than theirs combined ?
i was disguised as a citizen UNknown and went searching for them there
it was UNknown they were hiding in a small UNknown school
i arrived as your majesty 's troops approached
people fled in terror
why have you come at such a time ?
who are you ?
my father 's dying wish was to acquire a scroll from your UNknown school
i fear this may be the last day of our school
my honourable guest whose UNknown do you seek ?
master broken sword 's
rumour had it that his martial arts skills were rooted in his UNknown
in order to discover the swordsman
i had first to study the UNknown
which character do you seek ?
i am merely fulfilling my father 's last wish
what dimension of scroll ?
master wishes to borrow some red ink from the mistress
master wishes to borrow some red ink
has mistress heard my request ?
master wishes to borrow some red ink
t ell him to come himself
your student respectfully requests some red ink
broken sword had not even started on the scroll when your majesty 's troops arrived at the city gates
their tactics are brilliant and the archers are UNknown in their range and accuracy
they may penetrate our cities and destroy our kingdom
but they can never UNknown our written words !
today you will all learn the true spirit of our art
people from zhao are particularly strong in spirit
you asked for the character sword
why was it difficult to do ?
there are normally nineteen ways of writing this character
what i requested from broken sword was the twentieth variation
UNknown and UNknown both rely on UNknown the power of the wrist with the spirit in the heart
this twentieth variation would reveal the essence of his swordsmanship
to think that one character can be written nineteen different ways !
how can people communicate when they do not understand each other ?
once i have conquered the six kingdoms and suppressed all other rebellious states
i shall rid the country of these hopeless UNknown keep one UNknown language for the whole land
wouldn 't that be something ?
is your majesty not stopping after UNknown the six kingdoms ?
the six kingdoms are nothing !
i intend to lead our army to every corner of this land until we have established a vast and powerful empire !
you must be mistress flying snow
why are you leaving ?
i am going to fend off the arrows
you are not needed
mistress snow may not be able to repel them on her own
you have not come for the UNknown
who are you ?
please meet me in the library at midnight
without your sword this scroll would not exist
please meet me in the library at midnight
i have something to show you
while several hundred thousand qin troops were preparing for the next UNknown
i spent the night contemplating the scroll hoping to discover the secret behind broken sword 's skills
you say this UNknown contains the mystery of UNknown but i cannot see anything unusual here
the brush and the sword are UNknown connected
their mystery is only revealed to those who can perceive the connection
and you can ?
sky fell by your sword ?
i am a citizen of qin
i have a message from sky
only one person had ever touched his heart
if you agree to a duel meet me at the qin army encampment tomorrow
i deliberately wanted you to see us !
you are no longer in my heart !
i am not going to fight with you
what you did last night it was UNknown stupid
when we fought i could see that my plan had worked
she was emotional and agitated unable to focus
i defeated her easily
you are saying that you won by setting them against each other ?
three years ago i had once fought them face to face
i found them both honourable and exceptional hardly the narrow minded people you say
that is why snow and sky did not have an affair
snow and broken sword were not enemies
in other words your entire story is a lie !
only one thing was true
sky must have known one of you
which one ?
you were able to defeat him for one reason only
what reason ?
in order to assassinate me the two of you staged a fight using my guards as witnesses
laying this trap was not difficult
the hard part was in persuading sky to place his life in your hands
your sword may be swift but not enough to defeat sky
yet he willingly fell under your blade
what courage what gallantry !
so sky became your first accomplice
sky was a proud man who regarded himself without equal in this land
what made him think that you would succeed where he had failed ?
unless in order to assassinate me you had spent the last ten years UNknown a unique skill a lethal manoeuvre that no one can counter ?
having defeated sky you could already come within twenty paces of the throne
why did you need broken sword and snow as well ?
i suspect you have to be within ten paces of your target to be effective
so you required one more accomplice to help you advance another ten paces !
i believe that even though broken sword and snow had never met sky
they understood at once why he had agreed to your plan
how far am i from the UNknown ?
about ten paces
i only need one of you to help me
please decide between yourselves
how swift his sword is !
yet he was willing to give his life to this man
that is why he has the ability to assassinate qin 's king
we must go tomorrow
then let us die together
i fear i have inflicted too deep a wound
i should have been the one to go
i want you to go on living
if you died how could i live ?
promise me you will live well when i have gone
say it !
i should go
i have come to zhao to catch this assassin
please let me fight her alone
this is a dangerous criminal wanted by his majesty
now that she has been found it is my duty to arrest her
i have a prior agreement with the assassin to fight her alone
if i am unable to succeed please feel free to step in
please grant me permission to proceed
UNknown your sword !
i die willingly for our cause
please make your move !
how swift your sword is !
i suspect you had a battle with broken sword as well
like the fight between you and sky you and broken sword fought in the depth of your minds
except neither of you wanted to harm the other but were content to go through the honourable motions
this was also a tribute to snow
master asked me to give you his sword
why has he done this ?
master and snow will always be together in life or in death and their swords will never be apart
master asked me to give you his sword to help assassinate qin 's king
sky broken sword and snow gave themselves in different ways in order that you could come within ten paces of me
all three were willing to entrust their lives to you
surely one can ask no more of a friend
that is why you are the most dangerous assassin of them all !
how did your majesty figure this out ?
the candle flames in front of me can sense your murderous intent
the three of them and you were all willing to die for your cause
i am ashamed to say i cannot measure up to your courage !
your majesty has seen through our plan
i have only just worked it out
why else would i have allowed you to come this close ?
a man from qin would never try to kill me
who are you ?
my family was killed by the qin army
UNknown i was taken in by a family here in qin
ten years ago i discovered my real identity and decided to assassinate you
so you are here on behalf of zhao
i understand now
just as your majesty suggests there is indeed such a move
and what is it ?
within ten paces i cannot fail
within ten paces ?
it would seem that i shall not escape my fate today
and yet you hesitate ?
your majesty is most UNknown
however you have also underestimated somebody
within ten paces i can strike with surgical precision
the sword will enter and exit the body avoiding all vital organs so the wound is deep but not fatal
i respectfully request one of you to take such a blow from me in order to deceive qin 's king
to take such a blow from you asks a great deal of us
how is sky now almost fully recovered
he certainly had faith in your skills
the security around the king is UNknown
this is the only way
the imperial guards are not worth a mention
the king of qin should have died three years ago
what happened ?
the king of qin must not be killed
broken sword said that ?
what was his answer ?
he was unwilling to explain on that day
sky snow broken sword
that was why what he said next worried me greatly
as long as i am alive i shall prevent you from UNknown the king
i am willing to help you
three years ago somebody wasted a golden opportunity
this time we must not fail
tomorrow morning i shall meet you at the qin encampment
i would like to ask a favour
help me to fight him now
although i had agreed to help snow it did not seem honourable to attack broken sword
i found myself unable to make a move although we both knew that if we did not stop broken sword we would have no chance of success
let it go !
now you cannot stand in my way
even wounded i can still stop you
in that case i shall have to kill you
i worry i may have wounded him too deeply
with mistress medicine master should be out of danger in a day
have you delivered the medicine yet ?
i tended master 's wound myself
after the duel today take my sword and follow the qin army into court
if the assassination is successful return with a red flag
if it fails a yellow one
if mistress meets with misfortune at the duel what would be the point ?
when i look down from heaven the red flag will bring a smile to my lips
how is snow she is recovering
i am here without her knowledge
you once said as long as you are here you would try to stop me
abandon your plan to assassinate the king
do you know i am from zhao ?
so am l
how can you call yourself a man of zhao ?
snow asked me the same question once
the year we met i was a wanderer with no home to call my own
she was the daughter of the great general zhao UNknown who lost his life during a battle against qin
snow inherited his sword
i wanted to help her
UNknown and UNknown share the same source and principles
so we practiced UNknown every day in the hope that it would UNknown our skills and increase our power
snow knew i had been UNknown since childhood
iiving nowhere and everywhere
she said no swords existed there and no swordsmen
there would only be a man and a woman
the truth of UNknown has to be UNknown UNknown
it is the same with UNknown
both seek to return to a state of simplicity
gradually i began to understand
three years ago i reached the peak of my training
snow felt it was time to attempt the assassination
together we stormed the palace
snow asked me why did i not go through with our plan
i told her the king of qin must not be killed
this was something i had come to realize through studying UNknown
because i spared the king
snow turned her back on me
please UNknown your plan
that 's right
what will it take to UNknown you ?
you will have to kill me
so you are determined to go ahead ?
these words reflect what is in my heart
please think again
just as snow and i will always be together our swords will never be apart
master nameless even though i am only a lowly servant please permit me a few words
i have served my master since i was eight
from him i learnt the martial arts and how to live with principles
my master is never wrong
what he wrote must be important
master nameless please consider his advice carefully
which two words did broken sword write ?
only your majesty has the power to bring peace by UNknown our land
he hoped that for the sake of the greater good
i would abandon my plan to kill you
broken sword also said one person 's pain is nothing when compared to the suffering of all
the conflict between zhao and qin is nothing when compared with peace for all
who would have thought an assassin would understand me the best !
alone in my position i have endured endless criticism endless attempts on my life
no one has ever UNknown what i have been trying to do
even my own court regards me as a tyrant
and yet broken sword a man i barely knew was able to see clearly what is truly in my heart
i want to know that without a sword how do you intend to kill me ?
by taking yours
to have been understood by a man such as broken sword allows me to face death without fear or regret
let the good of our country guide your decision !
i have just come to a realization !
this scroll by broken sword contains no secrets of his swordsmanship
what this reveals is his highest ideal
in the first stage man and sword become one and each other
here even a blade of grass can be used as a lethal weapon
in the next stage the sword UNknown not in the hand but in the heart
even without a weapon the warrior can slay his enemy from a hundred paces
but the ultimate ideal is when the sword disappears altogether
the warrior embraces all around him
the desire to kill no longer exists
only peace remains
because of my decision today many will die and your majesty will go on living
a dead man begs you never to forget the ultimate ideal for a warrior
nameless came within ten paces of the king
he could not have failed
there can be only one explanation
he must have given up willingly
what did you say to him ?
i wrote two words
there is also you
how can i convince you ?
draw your sword !
draw your sword !
is the sword the only answer ?
i just want you to draw your sword
so you would finally believe me
i have always wanted to go home with you
that will not happen now
on your own you must take good care of yourself
why didn 't you block my sword ?
why didn 't you block it ?
why didn 't you ?
no more struggle
permission to execute ?
your majesty permission to execute ?
permission to execution ?
he tried to kill you !
do not spare him !
this is the sacred law of qin !
if your majesty is to unite the land this man has to be made an example of !
your majesty execute him !
your majesty execute him !
your majesty execute him !
your majesty execute him !
your majesty execute him !
your majesty execute him !
this series is about perhaps the most powerful idea ever to occur to a human mind
the idea is evolution by natural selection
and the genius who thought of it was charles darwin
i 'm a UNknown and darwin has been an inspiration to me throughout my whole career
his masterpiece on the origin of species was published 150 years ago
and it changed forever our view of the world and our place in it
what darwin achieved was nothing less than a complete explanation of the UNknown and UNknown of all life
and yet it 's one of the simplest ideas that anyone ever had
in this series i want to persuade you that evolution offers a far richer and more spectacular view of life than any religious story
it 's one reason why i don 't believe in god
i want to show you how darwin opened our eyes to the extraordinary reality of our world
in this first programme i 'm going to tell you who charles darwin was explain how he discovered his theory of evolution what it is and why it matters
by the end i hope to have convinced you of the truth that evolution is a fact backed by UNknown evidence
and i want to give you a glimpse of the brutal elegance of the force which darwin realised drives evolution on natural selection
when charles darwin was born 200 years ago sailors and explorers were sending home a UNknown array of specimens like these from all parts of britain 's growing empire
every animal was believed to have a unique place in god 's creation each made by god according to his perfect UNknown design
at school in UNknown the young charles darwin was taught that god had created the earth and all this rich variety of life just 6 000 years ago
today thanks to darwin we know differently
a typical class gets just a few hours to study one of the most important ideas in science
this lot got me
why do we need to find out about evolution ?
why do we need to find out about evolution ?
because it is the explanation for our existence and because it explains such a huge number of facts because everything we know about life is explained by it
i believe in my religion so whenever i read about evolution
i can 't understand it i don 't believe it
i just like believe my religion
right so you know what you believe when you start and any new book that says anything different you don 't read it ?
even if you UNknown e got evidence
i just like i UNknown e found a stronger evidence which is the holy book so
so the reason you believe it is because that 's the one you were told first ?
i can see that a few hours in the science lab is no match
for a lifetime of religious UNknown
i was brought up to believe it
is that a good reason to believe something ?
yeah because i went to church since i was little
yeah and it says it in the bible
yes but in the hindu sacred scriptures it says something different doesn 't it ?
yeah they 'r e brought up to believe that
so everybody should believe what they 'r e brought up to believe even though they contradict each other ?
well look i hate this phrase made to believe that 's awful and i would hate anybody to think
i was trying to make anybody believe anything
i 'm asking you to look at the evidence
perhaps you haven 't got a full impression of how strong the evidence actually is
nobody has seen evolution take place over a long period but they UNknown e seen the after effects and the after effects are UNknown supported
there 's only one thing for it
i 'm going to show them evidence
something they can touch with their own hands see with their own eyes
later we UNknown l see if i can make them think again
when charles darwin was a UNknown
he would have been as much of a UNknown
as some of these children
darwin was born into a prosperous UNknown family in UNknown
his father was a doctor and keen that his son should follow in his scientific footsteps
but the adolescent charles more interested in shooting and fishing than academic prowess was contemplating an easy life as a country parson
luckily for him and for us he had the opportunity to open his eyes to see the world
in UNknown as a young man of 22
darwin 's family connections got him a once in a lifetime invitation a round the world voyage on the survey ship UNknown beagle
over five years darwin collected hundreds and hundreds of specimens to send back to the collections
but increasingly he wasn 't satisfied with just recording the animals and plants he saw
he was beginning to have doubts about the biblical story of how animals were created
while ashore riding across the south american UNknown
darwin amused himself by chasing after UNknown shy ostrich like UNknown birds
but he was puzzled
had an original group of UNknown split in two and once separated started to develop in their own way ?
the mystery UNknown when darwin noticed an even more marked effect on islands
i was lucky enough to UNknown darwin 's footsteps on the UNknown islands last year
here he began to wonder why god would have created UNknown kinds of tortoise finch or UNknown on more or less identical small islands
were UNknown like these related rather than separately created ?
were they cousins of the similar but different UNknown on nearby islands ?
this pattern of relationships became even more intriguing when darwin encountered fossils
the evidence of fossils would help darwin develop a theory of life on earth far more wonderful and more moving than any religious story of creation
this team of american scientists has uncovered the remains of two million year old ground UNknown
today i 'm joining the dig because it was fossils like these that made a huge impression on the young charles darwin during his voyage on UNknown beagle
to darwin they looked like ancient giant versions of animals he saw around him
man the ground UNknown UNknown for millions of years and were quite successful
they were huge weren 't they ?
some of them were
UNknown what struck darwin was how apart from their enormous size the fossils closely resembled in every other detail the skeletons of modern UNknown living nearby
man you can see UNknown in the details of their teeth peculiar features that they share with modern UNknown modern tree UNknown and modern UNknown
we can UNknown that they are related to these animals
UNknown the discovery of fossils was a huge challenge to the religious UNknown of darwin 's youth
what were these animals ?
when had they lived ?
and why didn 't they exist any more ?
some suggested that fossils were just god UNknown UNknown his world
others claimed they were the bones of sinners drowned in noah 's flood
but darwin was one of the first scientists to correctly identify them as long dead species of animals
he was starting to grasp that the earth might be a lot older than the bible led us to believe
and how had he realised this ?
through a fascination with geology
during the voyage of the beagle
darwin had had time to UNknown himself in the UNknown work of charles UNknown
UNknown argued that the landscape we saw around us was formed by the slow action of vast forces not thousands but millions of years of UNknown change
so if the earth was shaped and UNknown over an immense period of time was there room darwin began to wonder for life to undergo slow changes as well ?
you know how old these rocks are ?
they 'r e about 200 million years old
back in the 19th century lots and lots of people came here to look for fossils
and some of the most famous fossils have been found here
i 'm taking the science class i met earlier to the beach
many of these UNknown have been brought up
to mistrust the idea of evolution
i 'm hoping they UNknown l find a small fragment of the kind of evidence
that made charles darwin think again
do you know what our ancestors were like 200 million years ago ?
they weren 't
they would have been kind of like UNknown little UNknown UNknown
it seems to be like a dream but it 's real
yeah yes it does doesn 't it ?
this is all UNknown rock meaning it 's laid down at the bottom of the sea mud coming down
layer after layer after layer that 's what fossils are
on a beach like this
the pounding sea gradually UNknown different layers of rock
and within them hidden treasure
a history of past life on earth
so each layer you go down to
you find a completely different set of animals
did you find that ?
that 's really beautiful
that 's wonderful
like darwin these UNknown have been brought face to face
with some tangible UNknown of evolution
the evidence darwin had seen with his own eyes on the voyage of the beagle UNknown huge UNknown questions in his mind
and once he started thinking he couldn 't stop
darwin once an easily distracted student returned from the voyage of the beagle a determined even UNknown research scientist
the trip had changed him and it was soon to change the world forever
back in london in the late UNknown the specimens he 'd collected and his reporting of the voyage made darwin a scientific celebrity
even more importantly while UNknown his finds
darwin realised that life forms weren 't fixed
they had changed over time
they must have evolved
it took darwin 20 years of research on and off to develop the ideas that would eventually be set out in the origin of species
he wanted to be fully certain of his facts
down house in kent
darwin drew upon the collective knowledge of an entire generation of UNknown all over the world
he sent out thousands of letters asking for data posing questions trying out theories
and back the letters flowed from all around the world into down house a river of information
darwin studied the detail of how different UNknown share remarkably similar skeletons
their limbs have the same bones in the same order just UNknown and UNknown to suit different ways of life
he was drawn to the similarity of early UNknown development in very different types of animals fish birds reptiles
increasingly he became convinced that every living thing must be related to every other
darwin began to see the history of life as a vast family tree
it may seem like a huge leap but darwin realised it had been achieved by small steps over a vast span of time
he UNknown the immense age of the earth
darwin believed the world was hundreds of millions of years old
today we know it 's over four billion years old and the life we can actually see around us has existed for an insignificant blink of that time
darwin 's wife emma used to play to him on the piano in this very room and darwin would lie on the sofa and listen
but how had this happened ?
why hadn 't creatures stayed the same ?
UNknown flap UNknown coo
it 's a very weird feeling these are actually darwin 's own specimens
i see from darwin 's own label here that this is a blue owl pigeon
UNknown are UNknown by this curious tumbling behaviour that they show sort of falling through the sky
this one has been UNknown it is a darwin specimen
this one actually has darwin 's original label here
darwin realised that for centuries through small steps pigeon UNknown had been in the business of evolution
here was life in constant flux
one of the big things darwin had to fight against was the feeling that people had that species were species and they never changed into anything else
species can change
he kept some 90 birds of 16 types devoured books on breeding and attended numerous pigeon shows
what excited darwin was the powerful comparison that could be drawn between domestic breeding and what he 'd observed of nature acting on wild animals
like the UNknown he 'd collected in UNknown
in the pigeon 's case it 's artificial selection it 's human UNknown using their eye to choose
i think i UNknown l breed from that one i want the beak longer or shorter
i want the UNknown to be UNknown or UNknown
so breed from the one that has the quality you want and then after surprisingly few generations you can produce a change in the breed
in nature it 's not like that of course
nobody comes along and says
i want one that has a great big thick beak
nature was also doing this
but how could nature make specific choices as humans could ?
darwin 's answer would come in understanding exactly what nature is
150 years ago
in the UNknown way
i UNknown e come to kenya where i was born
it 's one of the wilder places on earth where the full force of natural selection can still be seen
as night falls it 's kill or be killed
during the minute that it takes me to say these words thousands of animals are running for their lives whimpering with fear feeling teeth sink into their throats
thousands are dying from starvation or disease or feeling a parasite UNknown away from within
there is no central authority no safety net
for most animals the reality of life is struggling suffering and death
for darwin UNknown with nature 's horrors must have been a huge challenge
as a young man he had wanted to become a country parson
he had believed in an orderly and UNknown animal kingdom
now he UNknown the brutal reality of nature
darwin 's brilliance was to connect what he was seeing with an idea from a completely different discipline economics
thomas UNknown had written a popular influential UNknown about the UNknown of population growth in early industrial britain and how this would inevitably be stopped by food shortage and disease
darwin seized upon UNknown 's warning about a human struggle for resources and he applied it to what was happening in nature
as more individuals are produced than can possibly survive there must in every case be a struggle for existence
nature is an arena of pressure
of every individual born the chance of it surviving to reproduce the next generation is very very small
most animals die young
all living things vary even if only slightly
nature 's struggle for existence means that organisms with helpful variations tend on average to survive and reproduce
those without die without offspring
the race is survival
this is what darwin UNknown as natural selection the key to evolution
natural selection is daily and UNknown UNknown throughout the world
every variation even the slightest
rejecting that which is bad
UNknown and adding up all that is good
silently and UNknown working
until the hand of time has marked the lapse of ages
gradually very gradually as successful variations are inherited natural selection UNknown life into different shapes better and better adapted to UNknown resources out of their particular surroundings
longer necks are UNknown to feed from tall trees
thinner fur for warmer UNknown
life forms become ever more UNknown
this is the origin of species
but evolution doesn 't stop there
these species are then themselves UNknown by the presence of other species
the environment in the form of lions is getting systematically worse from the point of view of a zebra
and from the point of view of a lion UNknown are getting systematically worse they 'r e getting better at running away
UNknown are getting better at catching prey
prey are getting better at escaping from UNknown
so there 's a kind of UNknown it 's an arms race
arms races account for the UNknown advanced engineering of life camouflage systems camera lens eyes venomous stings
arms races can be seen in unexpected places
mankind is certainly not immune to the nightmare darwin called
the war of nature
it 's being fought all round our world
today in the slums of UNknown natural selection acts through a UNknown disease cutting through the population
UNknown 's prostitutes have on average seven to ten clients per day with a high UNknown of UNknown which causes UNknown
but genetic UNknown have found that some lucky individuals have a weapon in the arms race with UNknown
can i ask how long have you been a sex worker ?
i have lost many friends
many friends ?
she knew for a long time but she actually believed completely in UNknown that she was UNknown
she feels god has been good to her and she 's the lucky one
and it 's not luck either
the canadian scientist larry UNknown has studied the odds of survival
some of the women are related to each other UNknown we also think there is some factor in their blood in their cells that is probably UNknown transmitted
UNknown i suppose if we came back in 1 000 years we might expect to see a major shift in the frequency of these genes in the population ?
UNknown yes i think in any epidemic situation those people who are very vulnerable and susceptible will get sick and die
and those people who are going to survive are going to have some kind of resistance which they UNknown l transmit on to their descendants
back in england at down house now 20 years after his voyage on the beagle
darwin had worked out the answers to the biggest questions ever asked
but he was strangely reluctant to go public with his idea
darwin himself said that he 'd become a kind of machine for grinding theories out of huge UNknown of facts
i think that wasn 't really what it was like at all
he was an extraordinarily imaginative deep thinker
he had a UNknown curious mind as well
he was drawn to facts that didn 't fit
he once said i cannot bear to be beaten
darwin 's theory explained how the UNknown of life from the planet had evolved UNknown without interference from any god
but he was UNknown aware of how upsetting this flat contradiction of the religious story would be
he hesitated to publish
darwin was in despair about being UNknown
he was even ready to drop his life 's work
but he was persuaded by charles UNknown and others to present his UNknown work alongside wallace 's notes and then complete his masterpiece for publication
i UNknown e come to meet UNknown UNknown darwin 's great great grandson to try to understand darwin 's frame of mind as he finished his book
this is a book about geology by mr UNknown
it has this wonderful inscription
charles darwin buenos aires october UNknown
so he 's on the beagle really getting into his stride as a geologist
this is a scrapbook a children 's scrapbook that belonged to darwin 's daughter annie
darwin was no aggressive UNknown
he didn 't take to the stage to UNknown his work
but sought to influence leading UNknown behind the scenes
by sending them proof copies of the book with UNknown letters attached
he would write things like this vile rag of a theory of mine
was that genuine modesty or was there an element of false modesty about it ?
it was entirely real um and this is a very strange point about him
through the years when he was UNknown himself for publication um he was at different times enormously confident in it and at other times he was utterly uncertain
he had a deep fear i think that one species would be discovered that had some element of its make up that could only have been designed
doubts may have UNknown in darwin 's mind but finally 150 years ago he set out his ideas on evolution and how it worked in the origin of species
the book sold out its first run of 1 250 copies within two days
it has never been out of print since
the origin turned our world upside down but still there was one big gap in darwin 's understanding
150 years ago at the age of 50
it 's a genuine first edition origin of species
but it 's not just the most precious book in my library
charles darwin 's origin of species is one of the most precious books in the entire library of our species
this book made it possible no longer to feel the necessity to believe in anything supernatural
it completely UNknown the way we see ourselves the world and our UNknown
but what darwin never cracked was how the improvements of natural selection were preserved from generation to generation why they didn 't become UNknown by UNknown
it was only in the 20th century in the UNknown UNknown revolution that scientists married evolution with UNknown
genes are the long strings of code instructions to the cells that build all living things
scientists now realise that genes from the parents don 't blend as they combine during UNknown
each gene is inherited in its UNknown or not at all
the science of the genes also showed how new variations arose
when animals reproduce their genes are copied and put into sperm and eggs
during that UNknown process occasionally there 's a random mistake
those mistakes are UNknown which give rise to new characteristics on which UNknown natural selection then acts
and what 's more genes can be compared with pinpoint precision
just as darwin might have predicted animals more closely related by evolution have more UNknown in their code than more UNknown related animals
and these codes can be printed out right here in this man 's lab
in 2000 craig UNknown was among the first scientists to map the human UNknown our sequence of code letters
in the process this unlocked the ultimate proof of darwin 's tree of life
he was looking at the visible world and seeing how different it was
we now have the opportunity with this UNknown to look at the invisible world that he could only get hints of
and it shows that there 's vast continuity from the simplest life forms to the more complex
he of course UNknown UNknown because that 's what he saw the whole organism but you 'r e finding the incredible similarity that there is between creatures
i UNknown e looked at the genetic code of this wide UNknown of species and it 's a UNknown
that 's right
and really you 'r e producing the best evidence of any
i mean fossils are nice but if we haven 't got a single fossil anywhere
the genetic code on its own is enough the evidence from this lab alone would be
not just enough but UNknown UNknown enough
darwin anticipated problems with his theory
modern science has answered them
evolution by natural selection has been UNknown UNknown as fact
case closed surely
a difference there
i already believed in evolution but this has just helped me to understand a bit more about it
we have talked about it in class more but i still do believe in god
but i 'm starting to think whether evolution is true or false
i do believe in evolution but i don 't think it 's ever going to be 100 accepted because there are many religious people out there
i thought about it more but i still believe in what the bible tells me
when richard came to our school today
i started learning about evolution and i 'd really love to learn more about it but i don 't want to like
leave my religion and go down that path
i think evolution is the main part of how the earth developed but i UNknown l still say my prayers and just keep life going
whilst this planet has gone UNknown on
according to the fixed law of gravity
from so simple a beginning
endless forms most beautiful
thanks to darwin we alone of all species know that each and every one of us is a thread in the evolved fabric of life
darwin showed us that the world is beautiful and inspiring without a god
he revealed to us the glory of life and opened our eyes to who we really are and where we UNknown e come from
in the next programme
in the world of the selfish gene what hope for the human species ?
but even darwin hesitated to say this out loud
it throws into question our trust in our fellow human beings
are our morals and manners just a UNknown ?
since a struggle for existence drives evolution why don 't we humans run an entirely dog eat dog world ?
how about UNknown and UNknown cleansing ?
are they some kind of survival strategy ?
in this programme i want to confront the issue that darwin UNknown around in the origin of species the evolution of human beings
i want to ask what it means for us to be evolved
the question is more urgent than ever
increasingly religious people and others attack UNknown for in their view UNknown selfishness and UNknown
throughout my career i UNknown e UNknown with how to reconcile my liberal values with what darwin revealed to be the UNknown war of nature
so now i 'm going to take you into the UNknown heart of darkness and look for answers and for hope
natural selection is the driving force of our evolution but that doesn 't mean that society ought to be run on UNknown lines
as a scientist i 'm thrilled by natural selection but as a human being i UNknown it as a principle for UNknown society
evolution by natural selection is a very simple idea
over thousands of generations in a struggle for existence successful variations have survived to reproduce the process that gradually UNknown life into more and more UNknown forms
life forms that include the apes gibbons UNknown UNknown gorillas UNknown and us
here at london zoo back in the UNknown the arrival of the first apes outraged polite society
queen victoria for one found them painfully and UNknown human
but another visitor was UNknown
the young charles darwin saw the unmistakable truth staring back at him from the other side of the cage
east africa my birthplace and rather more importantly the birthplace of the human species itself
between five and six million years ago there lived in africa an ape who had two children
one of those children was destined to give rise to us the other was destined to give rise to the UNknown
over that surprisingly short distance the fossil record shows evidence of extraordinary changes
the UNknown richard UNknown and his family have uncovered the hard evidence in kenya 's UNknown valley evidence that charts the evolution of our ancient human ancestors
about 1 9 million years ago you have skulls like this turning up
this is what they were calling UNknown UNknown
UNknown brains still got a flat big face and probably ancestral to UNknown UNknown which turns up in africa at about 1 8 million years
this then is the ancestor to UNknown UNknown
this UNknown for almost a million years this condition and then it gives way to something with an even larger brain things that are much more like ourselves
these UNknown great vaults
i often meet people who say to me nobody 's going to tell me i 'm an ape
is there a kind of UNknown UNknown ?
do you meet that as well ?
yes i do but it seems to be so misplaced because as you know we are the fifth ape
we never separated from the apes we just do things differently
we 'r e closer to UNknown african UNknown than a horse is to an ass
horses and asses put together produce offspring
wow ! says everybody
in UNknown terms we 'r e so closely related to UNknown that it 's not ridiculous to ask whether we might still be able to breed with them
we 'r e the human animal upright big brained ape cousins who evolved to out think the competition
as a UNknown i UNknown e wondered at the challenging UNknown of this what it tells us about human society now
but over half the people on earth are so horrified by what UNknown reveals about our UNknown they just refuse to believe it
i 'm an ape
no i 'm not i 'm a human being
i 'm on a journey exploring the dark side of UNknown
i want to confront what it means for us to have evolved in nature 's brutal struggle
why should the fifth ape love thy neighbour ?
the thought of our animal UNknown can upset people
read the origin of species darwin 's masterpiece that set out his theory of evolution and you will find only a handful of passing references to human UNknown
that man was made in god 's image having dominion over the animals UNknown what it meant to be human so discussing human evolution was just too risky
darwin UNknown away from it and simply wrote near the end
light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history
but when the book came to be published in UNknown the buzz was all about the extraordinary UNknown for mankind
were we just beasts in fancy dress ?
evolution become known as the monkey theory
the row has not gone away
in kenya the cradle of mankind religious groups are trying to block the opening of the national museum 's exhibit of human fossils
the fossil record of human UNknown has a particular fascination
to me these are far more precious than the crown jewels
this is the UNknown boy
UNknown UNknown 1 5 million years old
the most complete ancient human skeleton ever found
it 's one of the most precious relics in any museum anywhere in the world
it would be an enormous pity if there were any pressure not to allow it to be seen
UNknown slngs a UNknown song
the ten million strong UNknown movement in kenya has run a hide the bones campaign
by coincidence i was born right next door to the church where the protest is being led by bishop UNknown UNknown
bishop how do you do ?
very nice of you to agree to this meeting
same here to meet the great professor
let 's go in shall we ?
i was born just over the road there
no i 'm told over the other side
well we UNknown l have to work that out
i 'm an ape
that 's the difference between the ape and me
well i 'm an ape
i 'm an african ape
i 'm very proud to be an african ape and so should you be
don 't you think the evidence should be displayed for all to see and make up their own minds ?
everybody should make up their own mind
no i am not against the display
i am against the attachment of the evolution theory to the display
see that 's all we 'r e talking about
you 'd be happy for them to be displayed but not the UNknown messages ?
they are complete human being skulls
well not really
the three million year old one had the same sized brain as UNknown
they were kind of UNknown on their hind legs so it was a first step towards becoming human
the next step was then in the UNknown boy to have a bigger brain and the final step was to have an even bigger brain like us
if that 's where we originated and evolved into this stage why aren 't those UNknown also UNknown into man ?
why aren 't they extinct ?
because by the time they developed to this level they should have been extinct
no that 's not the way evolution works
we 'r e not descended from them
we are cousins of them
so we and they go back to a common ancestor
there are the UNknown there 's us
we go back to a common ancestor
now that common ancestor was not a chimpanzee and it was not a human it was something else
and it evolved towards being a chimpanzee and in a different direction it evolved towards being a human
so what is the goal of evolution ?
what is the ultimate goal ?
is it for us to have big heads ?
there is no goal
where are we heading to ?
i mean up to where shall we say that this is the limit ?
it doesn 't have goals
it 's a misunderstanding to say evolution has goals
it never had
it 's a harsh UNknown process which simply favours those that are most successful at passing on their genes
it has no morality or purpose
and we humans are just one of its products
darwin took man off his UNknown and made him an animal like all others
we evolved in the ruthless competition of nature
so what does that mean for us and our society ?
to begin to UNknown with this problem we have to understand what nature is in all its brutal glory
it looks like nature in harmony
actually as darwin realised there 's a struggle out there
all the players are working for their own benefit and because they are surrounded by others working for their own benefit they tend to exploit each other
in the shady forest all the plants are struggling to get to the light
big trees pay the price UNknown by growing up to the sun
but this strangler fig does a very strange and cruel thing
it started life high up in the tree from a seed perhaps dropped by a fruit eating monkey
it then sent roots down towards the ground in order to get nourishment from the ground
and then these roots UNknown all around the original tree and strangle it to death
eventually the original tree will die and the fig will be left standing on its own having UNknown its position in the sun
the bitter struggle for survival in nature has been the dynamic force that has driven the evolution of life
and this is where my own struggle with the consequences of UNknown begins
attacks on darwin have claimed that his UNknown UNknown theory has unleashed the worst of human nature
if nature is ruthless competition and nature is where we evolved then is this the model for human society ?
every man for himself ?
well let 's look at this
there is one area of human affairs in which the dog eat dog mentality seems to many entirely natural
here is apparent justification for UNknown UNknown and denying help to the poor
several of the great UNknown of the early 20th century the so called robber UNknown like the oil tycoon john d rockefeller were UNknown social UNknown
they believed human progress would be delivered by UNknown business and society on nature on the UNknown struggle of the jungle
stand as monuments to rockefeller the architect of our business age
social UNknown is still with us
in the UNknown the american energy company UNknown ran a kind of nasty UNknown experiment
lining up 15 of the least fit of their UNknown to be fired each year
it didn 't end well
UNknown selected not necessarily the best but the most ruthless individuals who turned a blind eye to the UNknown fraud that brought the company down in scandal
ken lay chairman and chief executive officer UNknown
my best friend 's a money broker in the city and has more money than he knows what to do with
one thing 's confusing me and that is why you 'r e here
your presentation i UNknown l put my cards on the table
i don 't like the UNknown industry generally
for a very long time people have noticed the UNknown between economic systems and biological systems in particular the notion of competition in both systems
without compassion teeth UNknown ?
i wonder if it 's more UNknown than reality
do you think there 's a risk of overdoing the UNknown UNknown ? yes very much so
the press loves to play up company UNknown and UNknown as these heroes and in many ways they are
they work incredibly hard make great sacrifices
but the myth is that they were these great UNknown these people who could predict the future and drive an organisation toward that future
these legendary UNknown who
with UNknown you could say that they got it right
but it 's just UNknown
i UNknown e got my wrists just right
and we see the same thing in business
it certainly doesn 't provide a straightforward natural law for economic progress as social UNknown used to argue
but can UNknown be applied to other areas of human affairs ?
what about taking back the reins of our own evolution ?
don 't copy nature but control it
speed up the elimination process
in these institutions than when at large but it would have been better by far
if they had never been born
it 's been tried before
the UNknown movement of the early 20th century aimed to stop the weak UNknown through UNknown UNknown of the unfit
UNknown seeks to apply the known laws of UNknown so as to prevent the UNknown of the race and improve its UNknown qualities
here was a slippery slope down to a nightmare
at its worst UNknown became a dark tribal vision ultimately used to justify UNknown UNknown in nazi germany with UNknown echoes in UNknown and UNknown
i feel strongly that the UNknown that was the UNknown of UNknown in the 20th century was atrocious
but it 's important to say UNknown is not UNknown
UNknown is not a version of natural selection
hitler despite popular legend was not a UNknown
every farmer UNknown or pigeon UNknown knew how to breed for desired UNknown
UNknown like hitler borrowed from UNknown
what darwin UNknown realised was that nature can play the role of breeder
darwin has been wrongly tainted
natural selection can seem bleak for many UNknown
certainly nature can be UNknown and cruel
but i UNknown e been intrigued by what appear to be acts of kindness in nature warning cries UNknown for warmth and comfort and mutual UNknown
animals like these are UNknown what we call UNknown
they 'r e giving something to another at a cost to themselves
the question i UNknown e UNknown with as a UNknown is why
the explanation must at some point involve the brain
UNknown like any other behaviour must have evolved over time as brains have evolved
so now i want to talk to somebody who knows about our evolved psychology
i happen to have one here
it 's clear that the brain is an organ
it 's got an UNknown history
all of the parts in the human brain you can find in the brain of a chimpanzee and other UNknown
are you now saying that the UNknown for guilt trust that those are a bit like UNknown ?
there 's a lust to trust or is that not a ?
i think our moral emotions can be analysed in the same way
i think stephen UNknown is right and we do have an evolved morality
but i also understand why there is resistance to the idea
why would the genes for the parts of the brain that involve giving at a cost to oneself be inherited in nature 's brutal struggle for existence ?
darwin UNknown this as sexual selection
to explore this i want to look at another case where individual survival doesn 't appear to be the priority
a peacock 's UNknown is gorgeous but it must get in the way of its own survival
it 's easily spotted by UNknown and its huge weight must hinder a quick escape
so why isn 't the peacock 's tail eliminated by natural selection ?
charles darwin was puzzled
makes me sick
the peacock 's tail is a burden to himself but a boon to the genes that built it
something about the UNknown 's brain is attracted to bright feathers and extravagant maybe costly advertisement
peacock evolution has been shaped not UNknown by individual survival but by UNknown brains
UNknown in effect UNknown breed UNknown as pigeon UNknown breed pigeons
darwin UNknown this as sexual selection
evolution he now realised wasn 't just about which animals survived but which could prevail in winning the favours of the opposite sex
the naked cowboy keeping it real for you
i 'm the naked cowboy you gotta do what you gotta do
a peacock 's tail with its eye spots is like a walking neon sign
here in america
it 's a kind of hi tech sexual selection
thank you for
so i would want those qualities for my child the same qualities i would want in a partner
they 'r e appealing for people in general that 's how i look at it
for the women 's potential partners partners whom they never meet the process begins here
here we have the donor rooms where you know they can do their thing
of course you UNknown e got to have some UNknown material to help them along
but who are the women going to pick ?
are there any women who say just give me something at random ?
very very very rarely
that doesn 't happen
of course but in our society we pay lip service to the idea that there 's something taboo about UNknown choice
so you might think that women might as it were go along with that and say
i don 't approve of UNknown so
it 's america it 's a society of consultation and UNknown
people are used to
UNknown have to provide full and intimate details of all aspects of their life
shoe size and UNknown and skin tone if he UNknown easily
woman there is one that caught my eye
6 UNknown hazel eyes curly brown hair
favourite pet dog
he likes james bond
he likes jazz music
is it possible that among the qualities women want in a sperm donor
is UNknown kindness ?
the obvious alpha male qualities
there 's so many things that go into it than just looks and or intelligence
one of the UNknown that have been really popular is actually the nicest guy
he 's not the smartest guy he 's not the best looking guy
how do they know he 's the nicest ?
he 's actually written a really good extended profile about himself
i UNknown e actually met him and the profile checks out he is a really nice guy
so what 's going on here at a more fundamental level ?
this goes back to an old interest of mine
i became fascinated by the issue of how animals evolved to be nice when i started teaching biology at oxford in the UNknown
they give rise to the UNknown family nose down through the generations
they dictate what colour eyes you have
but such examples are just the outward and visible tip of the iceberg
now here 's the point we organisms you me an octopus a forget me not or a giraffe are survival machines
so they and they alone are immortal
i advocate a kind of genes eye view of nature
a gene that didn 't look after its own interests would not survive
that 's the meaning of the phrase selfish gene
ok so how can selfish genes support kindness ?
if genes are UNknown UNknown to make more copies of themselves how can a gene achieve this selfish objective by making its bearer behave UNknown ?
one part of the answer is UNknown
an UNknown gene can spread through the population so long as the UNknown is directed at other organisms that have the same gene
in other words at family
so selfish genes build parent animals who protect their young
in human terms parents who 'd rush into a burning building to save their children
this is called kin selection
the other part of the answer is UNknown UNknown
you scratch my back and i UNknown l scratch yours
when animals live in groups where they encounter each other repeatedly genes for returning favours can survive
in the UNknown UNknown i wrote a book bringing these ideas together called the selfish gene
the idea that UNknown ultimately boils down to a survival game for genes raised UNknown but it 's now widely accepted among UNknown
but it 's not the end of the story
i realised there really does seem to be something odd about humans
aren 't humans rather nicer than even the selfish gene theory would expect ?
we donate to charity give blood weep in sympathy at the plight of complete strangers
now i want to explore why
i UNknown e been struggling all my life with why people should be quite so kind and decent to each other
at first glance it seems to go against the dog eat dog UNknown of UNknown
to be sure UNknown was softened because it was in the selfish interests of genes to build UNknown animals
there are good genetic reasons for limited acts of kindness
but i can 't help wondering is this enough to explain the kindness of humans or even UNknown ?
the dutch UNknown UNknown de UNknown
has been a critic of the selfish gene idea
he studies UNknown
exhibit empathy and moral concern
that goes beyond the kin UNknown and UNknown for tat of selfish genes
let 's say there 's a big fight someone loses the fight very often another one will put an arm round them try to calm them down groom them
we call that consolation behaviour and that 's common enough that you can collect data on it
de UNknown has accused my work of promoting what he 's UNknown UNknown theory the idea that morals are a thin UNknown
on top of the UNknown UNknown of our animal nature
well the reason i speak of UNknown theory is because we UNknown e seen 30 years of books published on how humans are not UNknown kind
humans are deep down nasty and if we are kind it 's only to make a good impression on each other
and if we are moral it 's just a little UNknown over human nature
i take opposition to that
my feeling is that the phenomena that we see which you UNknown e described as UNknown are phenomena which need explaining
and we 'r e going to explain them in my case in terms of selfish genes
selfish genes are just as good at explaining UNknown behaviour as they are at explaining selfish behaviour
but maybe the problem is that it 's certainly a self promoting gene and so the word selfish has a UNknown content of course
i hate social UNknown too
but that doesn 't mean we should UNknown nature
or not face facts when it comes to the genetic roots of UNknown
i think UNknown has been UNknown
by kin selection in small groups in nature
but when it comes to humans something special is going on
we UNknown e gone beyond kin selection
our world now has been UNknown up
we live amongst large anonymous UNknown of strangers not kin who share our genes and not people who we might expect to return favours
and yet we still have a lust to be nice
the rule that 's built into your brain says be nice to everyone you meet
and that works in nature because everyone you meet is part of the small group
everyone you meet is probably going to be a cousin
so when i see another human being in distress weeping or something like that
i have an almost UNknown urge to go and console to maybe put my arm around them
what 's the matter ?
how can i help ?
um please let me help you
and that 's a strong inner urge which as a UNknown
they will never UNknown and yet the lust is still there
i can 't help it
oh she lost it
i got another one
could it be because our selfish genes are in some sense a blessed sense UNknown ?
compare it to sexual desire
the lust to UNknown even though we deliberately use UNknown to UNknown its UNknown purpose is still there because of UNknown from the genes
and it goes further
our UNknown selfish genes mean we don 't ape the UNknown of nature but extract ourselves from it and live by our values
as darwin recognised we humans are the first and only species able to escape the brutal force that created us natural selection
we civilised men do our utmost to check the process of elimination
we build UNknown for the imbecile the UNknown and the sick
we institute poor laws and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment
this is the 999 club in london 's east end
it takes in the less fortunate UNknown drug addicts and the homeless providing them with tea and hot meals
such UNknown is i believe among the UNknown of human civilisation
we care for the most vulnerable in our society
we look after the sick we give welfare to the needy
i feel which i UNknown e always felt that they need something hot to warm UNknown m up
when they UNknown e been out all night sleeping and they UNknown e got no warmth in their bodies
if they only have a cup of soup
and what makes you feel the need to be so nice and so good ?
you felt hungry as a child so you felt you didn 't want that to happen to others
that 's it
we can UNknown
a society run on crude UNknown lines would be a ruthless merciless place
fortunately natural selection gave us big brains
with those big brains we can plan a UNknown society the sort of society in which we would want to live
evolution has no purpose
some people find that disturbing but there is a better way to think about it
we alone on earth have evolved to the extraordinary point where we can understand the selfish genes that shaped us
they 'r e not models for how to behave but the opposite
because we are conscious of these forces we can work towards UNknown them
through kindness and morality modern medicine charity even paying our taxes we can overthrow the tyranny of natural selection
our evolved brains UNknown us to rebel against our selfish genes
next time into the lion 's den today 's religious UNknown against darwin
the ever more elaborate UNknown to deny the evidence of evolution and how darwin himself struggled with the UNknown of his own theory
charles darwin turned our world upside down
his theory of evolution by natural selection is one of the most profound and far reaching ideas in human history
it 's also alas one of the most UNknown
science now has the evidence that proves evolution is true
yet today incredibly the opposition to darwin is more UNknown vocal than ever denying plain facts in more and more elaborate ways
you haven 't seen it and i haven 't seen it so please stop calling it science !
if we had gone from slime to human beings there 'd be an overwhelming amount of evidence
you are a teacher of science and you think that the earth is less than 10 000 years old ?
yes i do
right now your destiny is all UNknown up
UNknown atheist !
we can 't get into the business of knocking down kids religions and the religions of families
why not actually ?
for darwin the problem was close to home his beloved wife was a UNknown christian
today we have public battles as we confront the ranks of religious UNknown eager to attack darwin 's great legacy which they just don 't understand
when i was a young boy i looked to god to explain life
and then i was introduced to darwin and evolution by my father
at first i didn 't get it
it didn 't seem possible to me that something so simple could explain so much
but then i learnt thought about it a bit more and then suddenly the penny dropped
i really got it
then i thought well if science can explain something
so apparently inexplicable as life
who knows what the limits might be
on what science could explain more generally
without any UNknown to the supernatural ?
at that moment i became an atheist and i UNknown e never looked back
charles darwin too changed his mind about this biggest of questions
as a young man during his voyage on the beagle
darwin still believed that god had created the world and everything in it
but then he came across more and more evidence that showed that life must have evolved
fossil ancestors patterns of UNknown resemblance startling UNknown in UNknown and the power of domestic breeding all showed that life forms had changed over time
darwin believed there was an entirely natural explanation
all animals vary and in the competition of nature some variations are more successful and more likely to reproduce than others passing their variation on
here in his study at down house
darwin UNknown that the religious story of creation ran against the evidence of the natural world
with evolution god just wasn 't part of the picture
but there was a problem for darwin
his wife emma was religious and the trouble began soon after they got married in UNknown
emma wrote him a letter describing her deep faith
but darwin was no longer convinced there was a god
he UNknown over the letter and UNknown on it
when i am dead know that many times
i have kissed and cried over this
darwin never UNknown religion directly in public
i think he didn 't want to hurt his wife 's feelings
instead he let his science do the talking
he predicted science would bring about a UNknown UNknown of minds
yet sadly today it seems harder and harder for people to see the light
here in the 21st century people are retreating from reason trying to turn back the clock to a world before darwin
UNknown chapter one says everything that god made was very ?
none of you think kill or be killed survival of the UNknown nature red in tooth and claw is good
is the world really 6 000 years old ?
d UNknown ou realise up till noah 's day people lived to be nearly a thousand ?
you don 't die because you get old you die because you 'r e a sinner
up till noah 's day there 's no record of rain
the australian john mackay is a celebrity among UNknown christians
he 's a UNknown
i didn 't grow up UNknown with this
it 's the result of finishing my university course
listening to students say
third year UNknown question to the professor
you take that seriously ?
oh yeah !
it happens so slowly you wouldn 't expect to see it happening
all of a sudden i thought hang on !
and that 's true
you 'r e using the word see as meaning see within one lifetime
if a phenomenon takes millions of years of course you won 't see it
which means you have a faith position
it does not mean and you need to admit it as you weren 't there
it means you use other evidence than the evidence of one man 's eyes
you have to look
that 's only 150 years ago almost right ?
and you haven 't seen it and i haven 't seen it so please stop calling it science
call what you 'r e teaching philosophy or UNknown if you 'r e gonna really be honest and my time is up
that 's ridiculous but anyway
thank you very much and bye
the refusal to believe in anything you can 't see yourself is absurd
think about it
john mackay can 't see a cell or an atom
or weather systems on the other side of the world
does that mean they don 't exist ?
darwin didn 't just trust his own eyes
he checked his theory against evidence gathered through extensive correspondence with UNknown across the world
mackay it seems to me UNknown science at a deep level
science is precisely not limited by what we can see with our own eyes in one lifetime
the whole wonderful UNknown of science
is to investigate phenomena beyond human experience
from far off UNknown to UNknown bacteria from far off UNknown to UNknown bacteria
UNknown 's next best strategy is not flat denial
but to claim there is evidence against evolution
and that a genuine debate is yet to be had
this is the UNknown favourite claim in america
where the battle between faith and science really UNknown
charles darwin 's struggle with religion was private
today the battle has become public
in my lifetime opposition to evolution has grown
particularly in the united states
50 years ago the soviet union launched UNknown and the space race began
in response the americans made science priority number one
the government poured money into science education
for the first time evolution was taught in every classroom in america
but the religious UNknown hit back
tell me joe how does he explain away god ?
well why don 't you come to the science club meeting ?
let him tell you
they developed creation science
that they UNknown as a real alternative to evolution
our eyes are amazing little instruments
but they 'r e only one part of the wondrous body that god has given us
i worry that this is UNknown not science
and i UNknown e felt compelled to take a stand
in the battle between religion and reason
can i sign in ?
can i speak to the number one british intellectual ?
i UNknown e read all your books
that 's very kind
at this conference of UNknown i 'm treated almost like a rock star
but there are sections of american society
that would happily lynch me
are you religious at all ?
i mean do you pray ?
no of course not
do i look religious ?
i hope you die slowly and you UNknown burn in hell
you damn blasphemy
and that right now your destiny is all UNknown up
UNknown atheist !
your UNknown intelligence is nothing more
than the fart of god
christian living for god
the only one who is blinded are the UNknown and stubborn
everything darwin said is wrong and evolution has never been proven
and nothing is UNknown now
the bible is the best book
nothing even comes close to its accuracy
and if you think god 's judgment is bad
the devil has worse in store for all UNknown
no UNknown at all in that one
it doesn 't scare me
i mean i rather pity these people
they react in a way that sounds defensive and actually really rather pathetic
ha ha you UNknown dumb ass
i hope you get hit by a church van tonight and you die slowly
slick in style and with a more polished line of attack
wendy wright is president of concerned women for america
wendy wright yeah
concerned about issues UNknown from UNknown on tv to poor old darwin
i UNknown l take you right in
thank you very much
would condemn american children to ignorance
by attacking sound scientific evidence
why is it so important to you that people not believe in a creator ?
that 's not the point
the point is that as a scientist
i 'm concerned that children in american schools and in schools elsewhere should be exposed to the evidence and allowed to make up their minds about the evidence
we completely agree
you could say which UNknown ? i mean
teach the UNknown
and it would be if it was a UNknown
between equally valid points of view
but it isn 't
about the earth being flat
because the evidence for the earth being a sphere is so massive
there 's also massive evidence in favour of evolution
but she doesn 't seem to want to know about it
oh really ?
i 'm sorry but you people keep repeating that like a kind of UNknown
because you just listen to each other
i mean if only you would just open your eyes and look at the evidence
show it to me
go and look at some modern UNknown UNknown talk to some modern UNknown
look at that evidence it 's beautiful
the evidence for the transition between the UNknown jaw and the UNknown jaw
the UNknown jaw has several bones the UNknown lower jaw has only one bone and the other bones that were in the reptile have now moved into the inner ear
it 's a beautiful transition
there are so many beautiful stories
you would be fascinated
let me show you
there are now literally millions of fossils
in museums all over the world
they UNknown e been dated and UNknown
and the relationships between them analysed
when UNknown out through time
the UNknown connections can only be explained by evolution
all life is related in a vast family tree
fossils also show how life forms change over time along individual branches of the tree
look at these skulls
there is a code of four chemicals in every cell of every living thing
so darwin 's theory can be tested
is it true ?
dna links all life through the code and the more closely related two species are physically the more similar their code
this is just part of the mountain of evidence that supports evolution
some religious people just don 't know enough about it
but some do
they see god 's infallible hand in everything
well the evidence that we have is the same for both of us
whereas you might see fossils as evidence for evolution
i might say this is evidence for a worldwide flood
would you want someone like this
teaching your children science in britain in UNknown ?
this is nick UNknown chemistry teacher
at a well respected northern grammar school
and he uses american UNknown material
in his general studies class
but you know it 's not just fossils don 't you ?
how old do you think the world is by the way ?
i don 't have a
yes i do
and again all i 'm doing is
this is a classic old chestnut
god is infallible therefore the bible is right
it 's as if i claimed darwin was infallible
so what he said was always right
luckily scientists don 't work that way
we sustain our ideas not through sacred UNknown
but through reason and evidence
and again all i 'm doing is bringing healthy debate into the science lesson
we have about a dozen different radioactive clocks and they all point to roughly the same answer which is that the world is between four and five billion years old
i 'm all in favour of teaching children to think for themselves and to question for themselves that 's great
but there are limits to that and i think that when the evidence is so massive you owe it to the children to teach them what the evidence is
what UNknown like nick UNknown claim is god 's perfect creation is in fact the result of evolution 's arms race
animals have evolved extraordinary UNknown to fit their environment but they 'r e not perfect
UNknown can go back to the drawing board
evolution is condemned to UNknown what 's already there
so nature is full of UNknown and UNknown
UNknown also ask how something so apparently perfect as the eye just sprang into existence
well it didn 't
science has uncovered species at every stage in the evolution of the eye
it is a UNknown process and each step of the way is more useful than the one before
the eye has evolved UNknown at least 40 different times around the animal kingdom and it has evolved gradually improvement on improvement
like what ?
the most dramatic is is the human eye
you know it 's held up as this example of perfection in the body
it 's not perfect !
it 's the perfect example of of why the body is not designed
cover one eye if you would please
and we take the pin and we move it right
you have to keep looking right at the bridge of my nose
yeah it 's gone
our heart keeps beating and never takes a five minute vacation for decade after decade that 's astounding !
are themselves evidence of evolution
they 'r e shot through with history
evolution is a fact
some things are just true they 'r e not a matter of choice or opinion
but you 'd never guess that in the place
where this matters more than anywhere in our schools
where the teaching of evolution
has become a UNknown sensitive issue for science teachers
this is UNknown britain and one of its fault lines runs straight through our children 's UNknown
how do we reconcile scientific truth with the deeply held convictions that bind religious UNknown ?
charles darwin was the first person to grasp the extraordinary idea that life on earth had evolved without the intervention of any god
and i UNknown e always been intrigued by how he himself UNknown with what that meant for religion
darwin was deeply worried about how religion spread not through reason and evidence but by being UNknown in children 's minds at a young age at school
he wrote that it would become
as difficult for them to throw off their belief in god
as for a monkey to throw off its UNknown fear and hatred of a snake
darwin became concerned by what he saw as the stupid classical education at UNknown school UNknown his eldest son william 's once lively mind
so he was prepared to brave the UNknown of victorian society to send his four other sons to the less UNknown UNknown grammar school because it had strong science education
150 years later darwin would find reason to be equally anxious about what his children were being taught at school
the compromised values of UNknown britain mean that teachers hesitate to offend the religious beliefs of their pupils even when these directly contradict scientific fact
earlier in the series i took a science class from park high school in north london fossil hunting
i was amazed by their lack of knowledge and understanding of evolution
so what do their science teachers have to say about this ?
i worry they 'r e UNknown too respectfully around traditional beliefs
some kids just won 't accept it
you know they 'r e brought up in families where they just don 't believe it and that 's an end to it
there 's no lack of understanding of it necessarily it 's just you know we can 't get into the business of knocking down kids religions and religions of families
why why not actually ?
why why not ?
i would not feel comfortable talking about anything but science so if i present the scientific case and i make sure they understand the scientific case
i think i UNknown e done my job but their acceptance of it is a separate issue
for some students truth isn 't something they see coming through science
that these well meaning teachers are running scared ?
who could blame them ?
obviously what we believe is affected by our upbringing
but that doesn 't mean we can 't change our minds
we all have the right to see the evidence and re evaluate our beliefs
these science teachers shouldn 't be afraid
to spell out the scientific truth derived from evidence
i don 't see that we can expect to convince them just by showing them the evidence really ?
why not ?
and to their parents
we 'r e talking about young people and identity
it 's not our place to to to fly the banner of science and say there 's no room for anything else
all we can do is present this is a way of thinking this is
science has given us so much
this is one way of UNknown life
we believe this is just one way of UNknown ?
we believe this is the way because we are scientists but it 's not my place to tell you that you 'r e wrong
we believe it because we 'r e scientists ?
do you mean that or that we believe it because the evidence is in the rocks ?
that 's what i 'm saying because i 'm a scientist and that 's the way i view the world
no it 's not because you 'r e a scientist is it ?
the evidence is there
it 's just made up
you don 't believe that the earth is round only if you 'r e an UNknown
you don 't believe napoleon existed only if you 'r e a historian
you believe these things because they 'r e facts proved by evidence
evolution is also a demonstrated fact
the truth really is out there
it 's not a matter of opinion
UNknown the quaint notion that there are many truths all equally deserving of respect even if they contradict each other is UNknown today
it sounds like a respectful gesture towards UNknown
actually it 's a pretentious cop out
there really is something special about scientific evidence
gravity 's not a version of the truth it is the truth
anybody who doubts it is invited to jump out of a tenth floor window
evolution too is reality
the evidence supports it
where has all this UNknown come from ?
well it started right back in the 19th century in darwin 's time
rather than just denying the evidence
the church of england developed the most sophisticated strategy
to face the challenge of evolution
it saw evolution as one truth within a bigger one and embraced darwin in what one might call a comfortable UNknown fudge
science would explain the workings of nature and god could take the credit for getting science started in the first place
it 's a subtle argument put forward by the most powerful christians in the world
let 's take it on in its modern guise
UNknown as a theory of how evolution works a highly plausible highly UNknown theory about biological history
i don 't have a problem with that
do you see god as having any role in the UNknown process ?
for me god is is the power or the intelligence that shapes the whole of that process
as creator god 's act is the beginning of all creation
by setting up the laws of physics in the first place in which UNknown evolution takes place
things unfold within that
UNknown UNknown ut there 's a problem for the church of england
isn 't it trying to have its cake and eat it too ?
trying to have both god and the laws of science
means that one or the other is compromised
either god can 't interfere and has no impact
or if he does get involved it can 't be squared with science
you do believe in some of the new testament miracles
i mean such as the virgin birth
any others ?
the empty tomb and the raising of lazarus yes
i think that there are certain moments when there is an opening in the world in which the UNknown divine action comes through in a fresh way
take the birth of jesus
it sounds awfully like UNknown
it 's poetic language
i of course love poetic language but there comes a time when you worry people will misunderstand it as
or that it 's a way of UNknown out of hard questions
it 's true or not
i don 't think you can UNknown out of that by doing poetry much as i love poetry
on the one hand i UNknown e got a lot of sympathy with the decent middle of the road moderate christians
so deny attack absorb
i think they all UNknown
but even i can see why religion puts up this resistance
i get letters from readers who have understood the truth of evolution
but somehow wish they hadn 't
UNknown can be UNknown even frightening
darwin himself was shocked by what he called the low and horribly cruel behaviour he observed in nature
and yet it was UNknown to natural selection
one piece of research shook darwin to his core
he knew how some insects like this UNknown UNknown
how do we face this deeply disturbing truth ?
duck under a security blanket of faith in god ?
but then darwin wondered what kind of god would create an animal that can only exist in this horrible way ?
isn 't it better to embrace reality bleak as it sometimes may be than to avoid it and live a lie ?
in the teeth of life 's hardships darwin was determined to live UNknown
he hadn 't just observed suffering as a scientist he experienced it himself in his own life
darwin had always had a particularly strong bond with his eldest daughter annie
he was charmed by her make believe worlds and her neat little UNknown while she liked to smooth his hair and pat his clothes into shape
but at just ten years old she suffered a painful UNknown death following a bout of scarlet fever
darwin was devastated
his UNknown wife emma told the other children that annie had gone to heaven
for emma suffering helped
darwin by contrast could find no meaning or religious consolation as he faced the desperation of UNknown
after the initial period of mourning he and emma scarcely spoke of annie but they never forgot her
religion became a source of tension between them
finally i think the tension had to spill out
in his UNknown darwin wrote an UNknown in which he revealed his anger at what he called the UNknown false bible story
and he added i can indeed hardly see
how anyone ought to wish christianity to be true
for if so the plain language of the text
seems to show that the men who do not believe
and this would include my father brother and almost all my best friends
will be UNknown punished
though his UNknown was written for his family
darwin must have known it would be published after his death
and he UNknown the opportunity to finally say in public what he had long struggled with in private
but if UNknown UNknown the religious delusion what can go in its place ?
how did darwin himself find consolation in a godless universe ?
religious people attack darwin for in their view draining some of the wonder out of our world for the UNknown of his vision of nature
the playwright george bernard shaw really hated UNknown
your heart sinks into a heap of sand within you
there is a hideous UNknown about it
a ghastly and UNknown reduction of beauty and intelligence
of strength and purpose of honour and UNknown
there 's no doubt that people do find a UNknown view of life bleak and UNknown but it 's still true and we can 't get away from that
just ponder for a moment darwin 's central idea the tree of all life now verified as fact by our UNknown dna
it means we are related to every living thing on the planet
and what 's more we are descended from ancestors who were winners UNknown in any way possible to survive and pass on their genes
you and i and every living creature can make the following proud claim
not a single one of my ancestors died young not a single one of my ancestors failed to UNknown
plenty of other individuals died young and failed to UNknown but they didn 't become ancestors
it 's UNknown obvious but from it much follows
it means that every single living creature has inherited the genes of an UNknown line of successful ancestors
we have all of us inherited what it takes to survive and reproduce
darwin had to bury two more of his children in his lifetime
another daughter and a son died in early UNknown
in memory of mary eleanor
and charles waring
he found solace i think in the very earth
in which he had to bury his children
for his last book he turned to UNknown
darwin was fascinated by how little by little over huge lengths of time their slow turning of the soil UNknown the whole surface of the earth
nature 's UNknown had their own extraordinary underground economy a damp dark life and death struggle to which we humans were totally UNknown
i doubt darwin wrote whether there are many other animals
which had played so important a part in the history of the world
darwin didn 't wallow in man made notions of the supernatural or an UNknown
his down to earth wonder at nature was his cure for loss of faith
i 'm going to visit someone with a similar outlook the philosopher dan UNknown
i UNknown e known him for 25 years
we 'r e the same age but i think of him as a kind of intellectual elder brother
but recently he had a brush with UNknown
there was a terrible crisis with his heart and his friends were all told that he was going to die
it was a very scary moment
does he think his UNknown would deny people comfort ?
i think it only UNknown a crutch that they don 't need
and that 's the crutch of an absolute immortal soul
that 's an idea that a lot of people think is very important
and what it does of course is it UNknown it with the idea of a material mortal soul
you have the the control system and the memory of a being that can be held responsible that can hold himself or herself responsible that can look into the future
and when people say where do you get your consolation from ?
i sort of feel well how much more d UNknown ou want ?
it 's great to wake up in the morning and realise you 'r e a part of this
i 'm not in the least afraid to die he whispered to his wife emma in his last days
darwin had wanted to be buried in down next to his two dead children
in the event however the scientific establishment insisted on the UNknown of burial in westminster abbey
a host of scientists philosophers and celebrities attended on the day
in true c of e style the church attempted to absorb the man who had brought down the house
yet even so the archbishop of canterbury turned out to be indisposed and god fearing prime minister william gladstone pleaded prior engagements
perhaps not for them the funeral of the scientist whose work more than any other has proved the biblical creation story shallow and wanting
i revere charles darwin
the world is amazing even more amazing than darwin knew and the more we discover
the more petty our little private beliefs seem
does UNknown leave a gaping hole where religion once was ?
not based on uncertain faith but sound science
in this handful of soil there are about 25 billion bacteria
that 's four times the entire human population of the planet
we humans and the animals we can actually see are a tiny fraction of life on earth
in the perspective of the universe the UNknown of the universe and of UNknown time we are insignificant
some people find that thought disturbing even frightening
like darwin i find the reality thrilling
apartment 72 knock !
that 's something
your honeymoon dragged on a bit long
and you have a ticket to stockholm in your pocket
back in russia on a business trip ?
how do you know ?
i know everything these days

UNknown was a UNknown
you and them
cut it out
remind you of anything ?
oh my god
am i ?
cleared off to that foreign kingdom
embassy doctor !
so cut out the swagger now
as if you stepped out for 5 minutes
UNknown me peter
don 't you understand
you 'r e right
yuri UNknown UNknown UNknown
directed by UNknown UNknown
something about our side
a talent finding its full expression
go on !
a master an UNknown for millions
achieved everything a veteran still only 31
how old ?
the puck is UNknown in the goal and who put it there ?
UNknown naturally !
back in a sec
he also said i look better
what about you ?
no i have library day today
what day ?
i am not at my best in the mornings
so what 's the matter with peter ?
but you know everything
for no UNknown reason
i tried to explain make excuses
the horror !
but he 's a grown up person he made that choice himself
and he doesn 't care
he meets us in moscow with flowers smiling
i came near to killing him
is that your work ?
he 'd been in moscow before making off
and he saw you
he came back and everything went haywire
UNknown i had nothing to do with it
you must have forgotten me
or you never knew me
look at me
i am too lazy for that
what 's he going to do ?
i don 't know
you know what he did the other day ?
nothing UNknown social i hope ?
you 'r e mocking me
well go ahead
that 's quite true
making UNknown ?
there was no work
and me you know i 'm unreliable
and not irresponsible enough to be a genius
it 's just the geniuses who can make anything work
an idea yesterday and today
what prevents you from finishing the work now ?
and his talent will make up for time lost
me i even forgot what it was about
but that 's another story
i don 't know about the windowsill but he is already jumping from bridges
what bridges ?
for no reason
how do you like that ?
seems i am present at a major confession of love
i forgot how it 's done
and it 's no kind of date and yet i was nervous
why on earth ?
he doesn 't love me
peter 's there he has an appointment at UNknown
talk him into something anything
we can 't live like that
we need some UNknown
so he made a show pulling out
the main thing is what 's behind it ?
and there 's nothing UNknown
there 's the rub
like what ?
and how are you going to pay ?
you took off too a bit later
may i ?
ask them to wait please
and the whole meaningless day can already be imagined with all its faces meetings conversations that make you want to never open your eyes
the heart is heavy as if something were wrong
so that neither your wife the person who is closest to you
this is urgent for the flood victims
two flights today
you know you have to pull yourself together go to work pester healthy and busy people with medical check ups and convince yourself that this is also important
and so every day you feel tension
like you were acting somebody 's part instead of living
somebody 's part
the 5th department is waiting
my life ?
but it 's a difficult question
it could be considered personally business wise on a social scale where would you like to start ?
let me go
seen peter ?
mind the flowers !
how come ?
i beg you
and tricks go UNknown
thank god ?
isn 't he allowed even that little ?
and what were you saying at the cafe ?
a non UNknown
buy some UNknown
what station is this ?
you alone ?
what if i run away ?
from me ?
pickles too !
not at all
see he came back
come help yourselves !
get lost !
would you like an apple ?
ask the boss
you really want to ?
we 'r e falling guys how to get it up ?
hiding is the word
everything for you
me smiling ?
why didn 't you tell me earlier ?
the day was such a UNknown i wouldn 't have worried
but now we have ahead of us an afternoon of miracles and unlimited opportunities
UNknown look who 's here !
hi girls !
get off me !
who 's grabbing whom ?
peter can you come tonight ?
i feel tight here put me on sick list !
you should give birth to UNknown
i 'm willing !
write to a newspaper
get off that 's enough
she has a husband !
and kids !
would anybody like a ride on a wild arabian stallion ?
well you brave men UNknown anyone ?
or else i UNknown l do it !
i see the gentleman in grey is willing
what not a single brave man here ?
i ask you is there a man in the house ?
ah so we have a brave one !
are you serious ?
is he a performer ?
is he on the bill ?
what 's his name ?
i don 't know
must be a clown
face the other way
what 's the matter with you !
get up !
look what a success you are
leave me alone !
let me go !
lie down !
i won 't live anyway
are you the new doctor ?
yeah the new kind
listening to UNknown on the radio
at my UNknown in UNknown
i have a good friend a UNknown called UNknown
and he has an awful enemy
UNknown the turkey bird
people were so happy then the was had just ended
when were you born ?
in africa in africa flows wide the UNknown
sad hippo is crying
i tagged along on the medical train
read this for the wounded soldiers
in the evenings from the harbour
ships are leaving for the distant shores
feel dizzy ?
did he come for UNknown ?
who 's UNknown ?
it 's all my fault
and then i was ashamed to show my face and go to work
my eyes hurt
i wanted to do it differently
i got up and went out into the UNknown
what to do people everywhere
and everything got so clear
i knew i had nothing to wait for tomorrow or the day after
and i don 't want anything
and it 's like i 'm alone in the world
i 'm afraid of blood i can faint from a blood test
so i found a rope
but where to do it ?
found a large nail behind the barn
i hammer on it it goes through the wall
how to do it with a goat watching ?
and the dinner call goes
so i throw the rope over the nail and UNknown !
and the nail gave way
so i 'm sitting there with the rope on my neck somebody bangs on a pan calling for dinner
should i go on hanging myself or have dinner first ?
you don 't want to live but you 'r e still hungry
and that goat too
are you crazy ?
what for ?
you know i also used to think it was all or nothing in life
but it can 't be that nobody cares
somebody needs you and me
while you feel you live
where 's the phone here ?
i UNknown l do it
tie it up
and peter 's gone
you UNknown e guessed
you know all this sweden is on my conscience
stop it UNknown
i asked him one thing to take me away
and the swedish job UNknown up right then
and now i 'm losing him and myself
three empty years feeling i 'd betrayed him
and you too
do you seriously think women decide everything ?
ask peter why he did it
he wouldn 't be able to explain
and it 's a very common case
i 'm saying this as a doctor
you feel you have talent
you forget about the brakes
it will serve me regardless
and you never think you can just lose it
then one fine day you panic what am i doing ?
you break up with everything punch your way out
but what next ?
time makes us ridiculous
do you think we UNknown e missed our chances ?
i don 't know
a girl i know told me
you 'r e older and more boring than my father
how old is she ?
hold your breath
who else is there ?
a spoon eater
a minute !
are her UNknown ready ?
i UNknown l show you later
why not now
nobody does things like this
they never tried ?
here 's the plan
we meet at UNknown at the hostel and take off
make all the arrangements cut up and finish off all your patients ahead of schedule
ah ! don 't forget the alcohol !
that 's where you start !
that 's where we UNknown l finish
did you hear there 's beer at the canteen
i have pickles drop by
don 't tempt me
they UNknown l have some for you
what is it ?
hold it !
hold it hold it !
where 's UNknown ?
but of course !
what if they really sock me not knowing that we 'r e acquainted that you just forgot to say hello
oh forgive me
what else ?
will you marry me ?
one of those ?
even UNknown !
you want to keep saving me all my life ?
well there 's no more need !
look inside yourself for once
and save yourself all you like if there 's anything left to save
forgive me at once
first time i was a coward
the first lie no
did you tell the truth ?
but today a common regular lie and i couldn 't
i turned to her as in a dream
i opened my mouth and the words didn 't come
a small one but still
you kill one you save one
like you ever killed anyone !
stop it never say that !
you mustn 't say that
all will be well
UNknown UNknown each other
stop the UNknown get up !
UNknown won the war
in medicine or economics in technology or space battle lines are being drawn
to triumph we need results UNknown UNknown results
now who among you will be the next morse ?
the next einstein ?
today we bequeath america 's future into your able hands
welcome to princeton gentlemen
no he has to have it all for himself
it 's the first time the carnegie prize has been split
hansen 's all bent
they 'r e only taking one this year
hansen 's used to being picked first
oh yeah he 's wasted on math
he should be running for president
there could be a mathematical explanation for how bad your tie is
helped rid the world of fascism
at least that 's what he tells the girls eh UNknown ?
the name 's bender
excuse me ?
play nice hansen
why yes john it is
i imagine you 'r e getting quite used to UNknown
i UNknown e read your UNknown prints both of them
the other winner of the distinguished carnegie scholarship
which is exactly what happens to you when you 'r e dying of thirst
so dying of thirst would probably feel pretty much like the hangover that finally bloody kills you
john nash ?
officer i saw the driver who hit me
his name was johnny walker
english department cocktails
d h lawrence
i 'm here to work
hmmm are you ?
so what 's your story ?
you the poor kid that never got to go to exeter or UNknown ?
despite my privileged upbringing
i have a chip on both shoulders
maybe you 'r e just better with the old UNknown than you are with people
my first grade teacher she told me that i was born with two UNknown of brain but only half a helping of heart
i don 't like people much
and they don 't much like me
but why with all your obvious wit and charm ?
and you know why ?
cause it 's boring
i cannot waste time with these classes and these books
UNknown the weaker UNknown of lesser mortals !
i need to look through to the UNknown UNknown
find a truly original idea
that 's the only way i UNknown l ever distinguish myself
it 's the only way that i UNknown l ever
no i UNknown e played enough go for one day thank you
cowards all of you !
none of you rise to meet my challenge ?
come on bender
does that seem unfair to anyone else ?
not at all
i 'm hoping to extract an UNknown to define their movement
you ever going to go to class or
classes will dull your mind
destroy the potential for authentic UNknown
oh oh i didn 't know that
nash is going to UNknown us all with his genius
which is another way of saying he doesn 't have the nerve to compete
you scared ?
be my guest martin
allen 's proof of UNknown 's UNknown
adequate work without UNknown
is there an actual question coming ?
what if you never come up with your original idea ?
what if you lose ?
ah there it is
the UNknown of the defeated
the game is UNknown
you UNknown e been in here for two days
you know hansen 's just published another paper ?
i can 't even find a topic for my UNknown
well on the bright side you UNknown e invented window art
this is a group playing touch football
this is a UNknown of pigeons fighting over bread crumbs
and this here is a woman who is chasing a man who stole her purse
john you watched a UNknown
that 's weird
well my niece knows that john and she 's about this high
when did you last eat ? currency exchange ?
you know food
and of course beer
i have respect for beer !
good evening UNknown hey nash
who 's winning ?
you 'r e joking
this is going to be classic
maybe you want to buy me a drink
i don 't exactly know what i 'm required to say in order for you to have UNknown with me but could we assume that i said all that ?
essentially we 'r e talking about fluid exchange right ?
so could we just go straight to the sex ?
oh that was sweet
ladies wait !
it was really charming
the faculty is completing mid year reviews
we 'r e deciding which UNknown applications to support
and actually i don 't really have a second choice sir
john your fellows have attended classes
they UNknown e written papers
they UNknown e published
your original idea i know
UNknown UNknown sir
may l ?
my bargaining UNknown are starting to show some promise
if you could just arrange another meeting if you 'd be kind enough with professor einstein
i UNknown e repeatedly asked you for that
now what do you see john ?
john you haven 't focused
i 'm sorry but up to this point your record doesn 't warrant any UNknown at all
thank you so much
come on let 's go out
i got to get something done
john enough !
you want to do some damage ?
come on !
goddamn it charles !
it 's not my problem
and it 's not your problem
it 's their problem
it 's out there where you UNknown e been working
that was heavy
he was onto something
i UNknown l come and get it in a minute
i will not buy you gentlemen beer
oh we 'r e not here for beer my friend
will she want a large wedding ya think ?
shall we say swords gentlemen ?
pistols at dawn ?
recall the lessons of adam smith the father of modern economics
in competition individual ambition serves the common good
and those who strike out are stuck with her friends
i 'm not gonna strike out
you can lead a blonde to water but you can 't make her drink
i don 't think he said that
she 's looking at nash
remember the last time ?
oh yes that was one for the history books
adam smith needs UNknown
if we all go for the blonde
we block each other
so then we go for her friends but they will all give us the cold shoulder because nobody likes to be second choice
well what if no one goes for the blonde ?
we don 't get in each other 's way and we don 't insult the other girls
that 's the only way we win
that 's the only way we all get laid
adam smith said the best result comes from everyone in the group doing what 's best for himself right ?
that 's what he said right ?
nash if this is some way for you to get the blonde on your own you can go to hell
you do realize this flies in the face of a 1 50 years of economic theory ?
yes i do sir
it is sir
i 'm confident you will get any UNknown you like
wheeler UNknown they UNknown l ask you to recommend two team members
sol and bender sir
has it occurred to you that sol and bender might have plans of their own ?
we made it !
cheers cheers cheers !
dr nash your coat ?
thank you sir
glad you could come doctor
the computer can 't detect a pattern but i 'm sure it 's code
why is that general ?
ever just know something dr nash ?
if you 'd like to review our preliminary data

you UNknown e done your country a great service son
captain rogers will escort you to the UNknown area doctor
none of those who have said they don 't like the method have told us any other method they could use that would be effective
and when you hear
have they actually taken the word classified out of the dictionary ?
how am i supposed to be in here saving the world if i 'm melting ?
our hearts go out to you
you know two trips to the pentagon in four years
that 's two more than we UNknown e had
it gets better john
please note the use of the word you not we
that was supposed to be just me
john exactly what 's the difference between genius and most genius ?
quite a lot
i UNknown e always got 1 0 minutes
before your new class ?
can i not get a note from a doctor or something ?
you are a doctor john and no
now come on you know the drill we get these beautiful facilities

the bell 's ringing
can we leave one open professor ?
it 's really hot sir
your comfort comes second to my ability to hear my own voice
however here we are
you may complete your assignments at your whim
we have begun
it 's extremely hot in here with the windows closed and extremely noisy with them open
so i was wondering if there was any way you could
i don 't know maybe work someplace else for about UNknown ?
not a problem
at a break !
as you will find in UNknown UNknown there is often a number of UNknown for any given problem
as i was saying this problem here will take some of you many months to solve
for others among you it will take you the term of your natural lives
what can i do for the department of defense ?
are you here to give me a raise ?
let 's take a walk
impressive work at the pentagon
yes it was
you knew oppenheimer ?
which project ?
well you ended the war
we UNknown 1 50 000 people in a heartbeat
great deeds come at great cost mr UNknown
well conviction it turns out is a luxury of those on the UNknown mr nash
i UNknown l try and keep that in mind
so john no family no close friends
why is that ?
but mainly it 's because people don 't like me
well there are certain UNknown where your lack of personal connection would be considered an advantage
this is a secure area
they know me
we were told during our initial briefing that these warehouses were abandoned
that 's not precisely accurate
by telling you what i 'm about to tell you
i am increasing your security clearance to top secret
UNknown of secure information can result in imprisonment
get it ?
this factory is in berlin
we seized it at the end of the war
nazi engineers were attempting to build a portable atomic bomb
the soviets reached this facility before we did and we lost the damn thing
the UNknown orders at the pentagon they were about this weren 't they ?
the soviets aren 't as UNknown as people believe
a UNknown of the red army calling itself UNknown UNknown
the new freedom has control of the bomb and intends to UNknown it on u s soil
their plan is to UNknown maximum civilian casualties
man is capable of as much UNknown as he has imagination
new freedom has sleeper agents here in the u s
mccarthy is an idiot but unfortunately that doesn 't make him wrong
new freedom UNknown to its agents through codes UNknown in newspapers and magazines and that 's where you come in
you see john what UNknown you is that you are quite simply the best natural code breaker i have ever seen
what exactly is it that you would like me to do ?
commit this list of UNknown to memory
scan each new issue find any hidden codes UNknown them
place your chin on the chin rest
stare into the light
that 's got a little UNknown to it doesn 't it ?
he just UNknown a radium UNknown
don 't worry it 's safe
the UNknown UNknown UNknown
they 'r e the access codes to your drop spot
so what am i now a spy ?
it 's all right mike
what are you working on ?
the problem that you left on the board
i solved it
you didn 't even look
i never said that the UNknown fields were rational functions
your solution is elegant
you 'r e still here
i 'm still here
you do eat don 't you ?
oh on occasion yeah
no i expect that you wouldn 't you wouldn 't know uh
if you leave your address with my office
i UNknown l pick you up friday at 8 00 and we UNknown l eat
one more thing
governor may i present miss alicia UNknown
miss alicia UNknown
first big date and all you know
so you boys need to look good
which is not a state you find yourselves in altogether naturally
why else would we have so many colors ?
so you 'r e a painter ?
that 's not actually what i said but yes
that 's a plan
i will get the champagne
oh thank you
do you ?
but i do believe in UNknown value to things
i actually made it to 4 348
you are exceptionally odd
a pair of odd ducks then
do uh an octopus
i can 't talk to you about my work alicia
i don 't mean work
i find that polishing my UNknown in order to make them sociable requires a tremendous effort
i have a tendency to UNknown information flow by being direct
i often don 't get a pleasant result
but still ritual requires that we continue with a number of UNknown activities before we have sex
i am proceeding with those activities but in point of actual fact all i really want to do is have UNknown with you as soon as possible
are you gonna slap me now ?
how was that result ?
what are you doing ?
i 'm attempting to UNknown UNknown UNknown within UNknown over time
and you ?
do i know you ?
my uncle says you 'r e very smart but not very nice so i shouldn 't pay no mind if you 'r e mean to me
and who might your uncle be ?
the prodigal roommate returns
not too far now UNknown !
her cowboy husband was too drunk to know that he was too drunk to drive
so i took her in
she 's so small
i 'm at harvard doing the great author 's workshop
d h bloody lawrence
well i UNknown e been reading a lot about you
how are you john ?
at first all my work here was trivial but a new assignment came up and
i can 't really tell you any details
top secret ?
should i marry her ?
the job is fine
but how do you know for sure ?
nothing 's ever for sure john
that 's the only sure thing i do know
i just lost track of time at work again
every possible color
i didn 't think you were listening
i 'm always listening
cause i need some kind of proof some kind of UNknown UNknown data
i 'm sorry just give me a moment to UNknown my girlish notions of romance
a proof ?
i know because all the data indicate it
but it hasn 't been proven yet ?
how do you know for sure ?
i don 't i just believe it
now the part that you don 't know is if i want to marry you
smile for the camera !
well done !
who 's who 's following us ?
the drop 's been compromised
get down !
take the goddamn gun !
he said you left the office hours ago
why didn 't you call me ?
are you all right ?
let me in !
every time a car UNknown or a door slams
i understand better than you could possibly imagine
you need to calm down john
now listen to me
now don 't you think your fear is a small price to pay ?
william my circumstance has changed
alicia 's pregnant
you chose to marry the girl
i did nothing to prevent it
the best way to ensure everybody 's safety is for you to continue your work
well i UNknown l just quit
you won 't
because i keep the russians from knowing you work for us
you quit working for me
i quit working for you
why would you do that ?
why would you turn the light on ?
what is wrong with you ?
you have to go to your sister 's
i left the car out the back
you take commonwealth
john i 'm not going anywhere !
when you get to your sister 's you wait for me to call you
no i 'm not going
just get your things
stop it !
uncle john !
i saw you on the slate and i thought to myself
how can i miss seeing a guest lecture by the UNknown john nash ?
what 's wrong ?
i think i might need some help
well now you tell me what is it ?
professor nash !
it breaks down in the face of UNknown UNknown
sometimes our expectations are betrayed by the numbers
UNknown are impossible to assign any rational value
professor nash !
what do you want ?
my name is UNknown
i 'd like you to come with me john
just for a chat
oh UNknown !
i know who you are !
no no no no don 't
charles they 'r e russians !
charles they 'r e russians !
call somebody !
steady the leg
watch your head
go easy now
sorry about the UNknown
where am l ?
you made a mistake
which work is that john ?
i don 't know anything
there 's no good in keeping secrets you know
i 'm i 'm sorry
you lying son of a bitch !
who are you talking to ?
tell me who you see
how do you say charles herman in russian ?
how do you say it in russian ?
there 's no one there john
there 's no one there
he 's right there
my name is john nash
i 'm being held against my will
somebody call the department of defense
my name is john nash
i 'm being held against my will !
what 's wrong with him ?
john has UNknown
but but his work
as such his illness may have gone UNknown far longer than is typical
what do you mean ?
how long ?
at least that 's when his hallucinations seem to have begun
what are you talking about ?
what hallucinations ?
an imaginary roommate named charles herman
charles isn 't imaginary
have you ever met charles ?
has he ever come to dinner ?
he 's always in town for so little time lecturing
was he at your wedding ?
he had to teach
this is ridiculous
john lived alone
you 'r e making him sound crazy or that he has lost his grip on reality ?
now the only way i can help him is to show him the difference between what 's real and what is in his mind
his work is classified
maybe mr UNknown can clarify things for us
but i can 't get to him without UNknown
you want me to help you get the details of my husband 's work ?
john thinks i 'm a russian spy
is that what you think ?
what did the doctor say ?
is he sick ?
you know you can 't go in his office
it 's classified alicia
alicia john 's always been a little weird
he said he was doing code breaking that it was eyes only
top secret part of the military effort
was he ?
UNknown come down all the time that some of us aren 't cleared for
it was possible
so is this all he 's been doing every day ?
cutting out magazines ?
i left you with no other choice
i do understand and i 'm truly sorry
that 's okay
everything 's gonna be all right
we just have to talk quietly
they may be listening
it 's breaking with protocol but you need to know because you have to help me get out of here
i UNknown e been doing top secret work for the government
there 's a threat that exists of UNknown proportions
i think the russians feel my profile is too high
that 's why they simply just don 't do away with me
they 'r e keeping me here to try to stop me from doing my work
you have to get to wheeler
you have to find william UNknown
of course there is
doing what ?
how could you know that ?
sol followed you
sol followed me ?
it isn 't real
there is no william UNknown
it 's in your mind
do you understand baby ?
you 'r e sick
it 's gone
imagine if you had suddenly learned that the people and the places and the moments most important to you were not gone not dead but worse had never been
what kind of hell would that be ?
john always spoke so UNknown of being here at princeton
and hansen is running the department now
so he keeps reminding us and reminding us
i think he 's ashamed
well the delusions have passed
they 'r e saying with the medication and low stress environment
no l i mean how are you ?
i think often what i feel is obligation
or guilt over wanting to leave
rage against john against god and
but then i look at him and i force myself to see the man that i married
and he becomes that man
he 's transformed into someone that i love
and i 'm transformed into someone who loves him
it 's not all the time but it 's enough
i think john is a very lucky man
hey ya chief
there 's no point in being nuts if you can 't have a little fun
jesus christ john
you 'r e supposed to take them now
can i bring you something ?
i 'm okay
i go back tonight
you know say hi
but alas i 'm stuck with me
i 'm trying to solve the UNknown hypothesis
but it 's difficult with the medication because it 's hard to see the solution
you know john you should go easy
there are other things besides besides work
what are they ?
what do people do ?
it 's life john
you could try leaving the house
you know maybe talk to people
you could try taking out the garbage
and there 's some more there 's some more in
who who were you talking to ?
i guess around here they do
i don 't know what to do
my mother 's going to keep the baby a little longer tonight
i can get three hours of overtime
i 'm going to bed
it 's been a while
of course i am
it 's time for you to get back to work
the bomb is in its final position here in the u s
knowing your situation requires you keep a low profile mohammed we UNknown e brought the mountain to you
we UNknown e UNknown the bomb 's location to somewhere on the eastern UNknown
but we haven 't been able to pinpoint its exact position
their codes have grown increasingly complex
here look at this john
that quack !
psychological bullshit !
wheeler has no record of you
do you think we list our personnel ?
john i 'm sorry you had to go through all this
i UNknown e gone to a great deal of trouble to get you back
i can restore your status at wheeler
i can let the world know what you did
but i need you now soldier
i was so scared you weren 't real
there 's a storm coming
i 'm just going to grab the laundry okay ?
i UNknown l draw his bath
it 's okay
charles you just watch the baby
i UNknown e got one more to close !
charles was watching him
he 's been injected with a UNknown serum
i can see him because of a chemical that was released into my UNknown when my UNknown dissolved
i couldn 't tell you it was for your own protection !
you UNknown e got to stop her john
you leave her out of this
who are you talking to ?
it 's not her fault
no she won 't
john answer me !
i can 't let that happen
yes hello ?
is he in ?
get away from me
get away !
uncle john ?
alicia and UNknown
she never gets old
because i couldn 't do my work
i couldn 't help with the baby
i couldn 't
you think that 's better than being crazy ?
we UNknown l need to start you on a higher run of UNknown shocks and a new medication
UNknown is UNknown
it 's a problem
it 's a problem with no solution
and that 's what i do i solve problems
that 's what i do best
this isn 't math
all i have to do is apply my mind
there 's no UNknown no proof
you can 't reason your way out of this
why not ?
because your mind is where the problem is in the first place
i can do this
all i need is time
is that the baby ?
the baby 's at my mother 's john
without treatment john the fantasies may take over entirely
you almost ready ?
i won 't come home
he said that if you said that he has commitment papers for me to sign
well maybe you won 't sign them
maybe you UNknown l just give me some time
i will try to figure this out
whatever you do
you shouldn 't be here
i 'm not safe anymore
would you have hurt me john ?
i don 't know
UNknown said to call if you try and kill me or anything
you want to know what 's real ?
maybe it 's here
my savior complex takes on a completely different form
i heard what happened and well
i i wanted to write and i tried you at macarthur 's but you 'd left and i just
this is UNknown 's old office
seems that you won after all martin
they were wrong john
god it 's so good to see you
what brings you back to princeton ?
tell him you 'r e a genius
you 'r e a genius john !
tell him your work is critical
john please !
of course what are old friends for ?
is that what we are martin ?
that a certain level of attachment familiar places familiar people might help me elbow out these
these certain delusions that i have
it 's a lot to ask and now that i 'm here
i 'm quite certain that you will just say no
but i was wondering if i could hang around
well this guy tries to wander into the library but he doesn 't have i d
why can 't people read their UNknown huh ?
then he goes totally nuts
not real !
there 's no mission
is this what you are soldier ?
some useless UNknown ?
you 'r e gonna end up in a cell !
old worthless discarded
you are not real !
you are not real !
you 'r e still talking to me soldier
there 's no mission !
i 'm not a soldier !
nash nash hey hey hey
ladies and gentlemen the great john nash !
everybody was just staring at me
john you know that stress UNknown the delusions
charles was there
maybe UNknown 's right
charles you UNknown e been a very good friend to me
i just can 't
it 's it 's an honor professor nash
is something wrong ?
good morning eager young minds
it 's never gonna work john
you 'r e just humiliating yourself
it 's pathetic !
oh man !
dad you UNknown e got my books
well what do you think ?
yes it is
you 'r e
the one you wrote here at princeton
to come up with something totally original the way you did
you know i was young
i believe i can prove that UNknown UNknown are covering spaces
that everything everything is connected
that it 's all part of the same subject
when was the last time you ate ?
excuse me ?
oh thank you
let us say UNknown
mathematics is very specific and it is an art form no matter what these people around here will tell you especially the people from biology
don 't listen to any of those people
let me go back to what you were doing before
i might want to steal this write a book and get famous
i was thinking that i might teach
a classroom with 50 students can be UNknown for anyone
john besides you 'r e a terrible teacher
i 'm an acquired taste martin
i was hoping there still might be something i could contribute
what about the
and maybe they never will be
but i UNknown e gotten used to ignoring them and i think as a result they UNknown e kind of given up on me
you think that 's what it 's like with all our dreams and our nightmares martin ?
you UNknown e got to keep feeding them for them to stay alive ?
john they haunt you though
they 'r e my past martin
everybody 's haunted by their past
well good bye
maybe in the spring
i UNknown l ring her in an awful lot of trouble
professor nash ?
see you next week professor
see you next week
professor my name is thomas king
thomas king ?
forgive me but i 'm just a little stunned
over the past few years your UNknown has become a UNknown of modern economics
suddenly everybody likes that one
what about my work on other some such projects UNknown UNknown ?
the application of your bargaining problem to UNknown UNknown UNknown or to UNknown cases
UNknown cases ?
no no you haven 't
cause i wouldn 't have thought of that
shall we have tea ?
oh i don 't go in there
i usually just take my sandwich in the library
come on john
it 's a big day
i 'm not
i enjoy the flavor that they have
i have not been in this room for some many years
i wonder what tea they serve
why thank you young lady
things have certainly changed around here
i have a son that age
i would have thought you 'd only find out if you won or lost
that is generally the case yes
but these are special circumstances
the awards are substantial
find out if i would screw everything up if i actually won ?
dance around the UNknown strip naked and squawk like a chicken things of this nature ?
something like that yes
yes it is possible
but i still see things that are not here
i just choose not to acknowledge them
like a diet of the mind
i choose not to indulge certain UNknown
like my appetite for patterns
perhaps my appetite to imagine and to dream
thank you very much
in the UNknown and UNknown that lead to reason
but after a lifetime of such UNknown
i ask what truly is logic ?
who decides reason ?
and i have made the most important discovery of my career
the most important discovery of my life
it is only in the mysterious UNknown of love that any logical reasons can be found
i 'm only here tonight because of you
you are the reason i am
you are all my reasons
i UNknown l call for the car dad
oh yes i am
thank you so much
are you interested in a ride ?
where 's it going to ?
all love can do
hold you in my arms
give you dreams
till the morning comes
another terry leather low UNknown done
good you 'r e glad but have you all sorted out for your wedding tomorrow ?
yeah of course terry
i hope so
go make UNknown more beautiful than you already are
if that 's possible
at his stag do ?
i UNknown e got UNknown 's money
the problem is it 's tied up in these cars and you UNknown want to trash the lot of UNknown m
mr UNknown doesn 't care about your inventory
mr UNknown wants to know that he 's getting paid
any day i swear UNknown
what did you call me ?
i called you UNknown UNknown !
everyone calls you UNknown and him UNknown
UNknown and UNknown ?
well i 'm not gonna say it to your face aren 't i ?
well you just bloody did !
yeah well you got me rolled
i 'm very UNknown
not every customer is a satisfied customer
what are you doing here my dear UNknown ?
what are you doing tonight ?
taking him out for a drink
a proposition ?
and i UNknown l fill you in on the details
make it 9 o UNknown lock
something like that
i don 't know what you 'r e talking about i 'm a married man
what do you think am i presentable ?
not sure about the tie darling
what 's this ?
michael abdul UNknown
the UNknown socialist press would have us believe this michael x is a UNknown champion of the poor and oppressed
and the black robin hood of UNknown hill
the richer UNknown and more famous they will all fall over him
the truth is he 's a slum landlord a drug dealer and a vicious pimp who should have been in prison years ago
are you not charging outrageous rents to my brothers and sisters mr brown ?
i 'm charging the same as your slum lord friend lew vogel
ten UNknown a week is too much for these UNknown
you know what this is ?
it 's a slave collar
and a white man made my mothers and fathers wear this to bend them to his will
can i bend you to my will mr brown ?
you sure got a faithful dog now michael
michael i don 't think we should get our hopes up here
UNknown UNknown assault on this man brown here as well as your previous problems with the law i mean
you could be looking at 10 to 20 years i 'd say
i don 't think so
i am smarter and better protected than whitey thinks
until we get our hands on these snaps the police can 't move
the public prosecutor won 't move and the home office doesn 't want to know
has anyone actually seen these photographs ?
yes but at the minute i 'm not at liberty to say who that person is
we UNknown e had michael x under surveillance for quite a while
he keeps a safe deposit box at the lloyd 's bank in UNknown
we believe that 's were the photos are located
seems straightforward enough
that would have to be UNknown at the highest level and that 's not going to happen
do you see our problem ?
there can be no connection to 5 or 6
so you want me to come up with something devoid any UNknown for anyone
we 'd welcome suggestions tim
and if it all goes pear shaped wrong i assume it 's my arse on the line ?
you 'r e young and ambitions tim
a chance to make a name for yourself
thank you sir
be my guest
found what ?
oh tim thank god !
i 'm in a spot of bother
i UNknown e got problems
what have you been up to ?
business or pleasure ?
i know you terry and i know your mates friends
you UNknown e always been looking for the big score the one that makes sense of everything
i have it for you
what would you know about a bank ?
i UNknown e been seeing this guy who runs his own business
seems like the trains have been setting off the UNknown alarms in the vault and they UNknown e had to turn them off
so for a week or so they won 't have any
now why would he tell you all this ?
we were having a laugh about it
imagine if half the villains in in london knew about this he said
and i thought i know half the villains in london
i grew up with some of them
look me and my mates have been involved in the odd bit of UNknown criminal acts
can you see us UNknown up taking on a bank like the jesse james gang ?
this isn 't about waving a UNknown at a cashier 's head
this is about getting into the basement where the deposit boxes are
hidden secret wealth
UNknown UNknown people won 't report it
oh no no no
it 's a once in a lifetime opportunity terry
we can 't pass it up
i didn 't expect this from you tonight UNknown
what did you expect ?
i UNknown l have to think about it
you better get off to your stag party
thanks for the drink
are you going ?
can i get a UNknown and soda no ice ?
is he offering ?
i don 't know it 's late
do you need to run home like a good little boy ?
i guess i UNknown e got time
what exactly do you do ?
bit of this bit of that
how did you and UNknown meet ?
i met UNknown in los angeles last spring
he was UNknown money for a black UNknown school and writing his life 's story
and what an extraordinary life it has been
the book is called from the dead level malcolm x and me
i UNknown e read the manuscript
UNknown is a poet
a friend is throwing a thing next week to celebrate the launch of brother UNknown 's book and you are all invited
UNknown tell us more about your book
it 's about being born black in america
can any of you imagine what it is like to be born a black man in this world ?
can any of you white women imagine what it would be like to bring a black baby into this world ?
good evening sir
we 'r e not
it 's a bit UNknown isn 't it ?
you know what scares me more ?
living and dying with nothing to show for it
you know how old mozart was when he composed his first minuet ?
because it 's tattooed on that stripper 's arse kevin
what the fuck 's it matter how i know ?
it 's a fact and you 'r e missing the point UNknown
what i 'm trying to say is we stop fucking about and stop picking the shit from under our fingernails
UNknown quiet lads
i thought you were way past being a UNknown jerry
your associate sonia UNknown has raised prices at that knocking shop of hers 120 quid up from a 100
and your point ?
i think we are owed some money
cause even sonia 's can be raided
yeah you would do that wouldn 't you ?
you 'd kill the goose that lays you golden eggs
wouldn 't that be dumb would it ?
but then again everyone knows coppers are dumb
now you can do one thing for me
you stop your UNknown from having their boys night out in my clubs
they 'r e loud they 'r e lewd horny and they expect free UNknown sex
you know what that 's disgusting
my most of them have families
we UNknown l pass the word along
lew you tell your greedy little UNknown cops to find their UNknown extra income elsewhere
no one is going to bother me
my patrons could have a lot of these UNknown UNknown cut out of pasture
well i 'd say spread the wealth around and keep the peace
five quid a week extra
it 's all it 's worth
i UNknown l pass it on
very kind of you sonia
good to see you
everything okay ?
the UNknown ad on the beach
i don 't know why
you 'r e still a knockout
what are you doing these days dave ?
extra you know
the wedding photos ?
fashion is my game
thank you dave
we 'r e interested
maybe open a box of our own
i UNknown e already done that
we can go and have a look tomorrow
tomorrow it is
she is off
yeah come on
i suppose what she meant was money can 't by what we have
didn 't you use to go out with her ?
no love that was kevin
he had this big thing for her
and you didn 't ?
i saw this gorgeous little bum in a pencil skirt and i thought
oh i UNknown e gotta have that
but audrey surely already had blows so i pulled you
come on dad
that 's right
forget about it
you 'r e joking ?
that 's nothing to be ashamed of
this is the one
she knows this bloke runs a security company
he is married
here we go
in the back is an underground car park with direct access to the shops UNknown
we can pull in here from UNknown street into the car park for UNknown and UNknown without being seen from the street
we UNknown l dig a tunnel from the basement of the shop under the chicken inn and pop up in the safe deposit vault
i UNknown e got a question
what do ourselves know about digging tunnels ?
so what do you reckon UNknown ?
what do i reckon ?
i reckon i know you guys but i don 't know her
don 't worry about UNknown she 's solid
we go way back
don 't you think it 's a little out of your league ?
maybe it 's time to step up to the first division
there 's going to be UNknown concrete under the vault
we 'r e going to need a UNknown lance a UNknown a generator
lights ropes cables the works
it 's about 40 feet UNknown of digging before we 'r e under the bank
we can hire some UNknown UNknown from camden town to do the digging
that 's brilliant dave
and then you have to get on your tommy UNknown suit
this way michael
what are your plans ?
i am returning to trinidad to liberate my brothers and sisters from the UNknown of the british UNknown
what about the charges you are facing ?
how can you leave england ?
they are liars and cowards
if they had anything against me but their fear of me
i 'd be tried and jailed
see you later UNknown
i know someone guy singer
calls himself the major
he has got this white posh accent if anyone comes UNknown about
a bit tight under the arms dont you think ?
traditional fit sir
it tends to UNknown any impulsive acts of surrender
i UNknown l be right back sir
what on earth are you doing here ?
got a bit of business for you here guy
you UNknown l be tempted
sit down UNknown
taking the e jaguar e type for a test drive
tell your boss he can have his inventory back when he settles mr UNknown 's debt
and it 'd better be soon or we UNknown l be back to tap through his UNknown
if i was you two i was looking for another job
romantic dinner on a monday night ?
all i was trying to do is get ahead of the game

why do you think if you vanish you UNknown l become someone else ?
at least no one will know who i was
why did you pick kevin and me ?
you could have found better thieves
for old times sake
kevin has it in his mind that we had this passionate affair
the truth is it came down to 4 chinese meals and a roll in the hay
and that was a long time ago
look at this !
how would your wife fancy a tiara ?
too bloody right
what 's so special about this box ?
it 's my lucky number
all yours me lovely

look we have to have some sort of system
you don 't know what you are throwing or what you are keeping
yeah but we know what money looks like
we 'r e not throwing that away are we ?
how long does it take to rob a bank ?
no they are not there not UNknown

UNknown he is UNknown the front door
they are going in
tell the UNknown
well it isn 't my bank that 's being robbed
sorry for calling you on a sunday morning sir

they are gone
they could be coming back
the ambulance reports it 's outside the lloyd 's bank on baker street
UNknown can you hear me ?
look if he 's not picking up something is wrong
you 'r e right

heavy cock sure hunt
i UNknown l chop off one more and then i got one like your little UNknown UNknown
how did you find this place then terry ?
a bloke and i used to run a chop shop here stolen cars sold in parts

how could you lose control of the operation ?
i thought you were on top of this thing
sir it worked
you know an ugly thought has just UNknown
lots of money in that vault UNknown bonds
you and your sweetie haven 't cooked up something between you i hope
you think i 'd betray you ?
there are UNknown
let 's hope they don 't have another bidder
she won 't cross us
she knows what we 'r e capable of
how does she even know who the hell we are ?
i 'm sure she will contact me when she comes to her senses
going anywhere else would be a death sentence
you better hope she does everett
or it may be yours
here you go UNknown
the old UNknown pervert
he 's an m p member of parliament
lord UNknown you know
well on that picture he 's not
i believe this is one of your old movies dave
piss off UNknown
i 'm with you guy
i don 't have to remind you
keep a low profile
the only thing i 'm buying is a one way ticket back to cyprus
i 'm never coming back
we should have a reunion
20 years the savoy grill
yeah right maybe for you guy
i still wouldn 't let us lot in
you two have been staring daggers at each other since we left the bank
what is it ?
i think UNknown has got something to tell us
hang on pal
you knew the exact box this stuff was in UNknown
you 'd better come clean and tell us what this is really about
about a month ago i got busted at UNknown on a drug charge
this guy i know said he would fix it to keep me out of jail if i do him a favour
he knew i knew some villains
he wanted to set up a robbery to get these
fucking hell !
same guy you said was trying to pick you up in the club right ?
he 's a guy i met at the sombrero club
he works for some shady outfit in white hall
oh no no
or 6 ?
no we couldn 't
the deal with him is we get to keep everything else
and you believe that ?
you put your trust in some prick we UNknown e never even met
you lied to us UNknown !
we were sitting ducks right from ther start
thank you very much
this can work out
these people are regular UNknown bad cops UNknown
they are above that
they think we UNknown e seen these photos we 'r e expendable as dog shit
you know what ?
i 'm out of here
i 'm not waiting for a load of spooks and coppers to come cracking my head
i 'm splitting like guy and UNknown
it would be better if we stuck together dave
and why tell me ? UNknown UNknown we UNknown e been so truthful with each other so far ?
dave come on
see my mom
we 'd better get out of here too
in case guy and UNknown get picked up
let 's split the lot of this
there may be someone else in this shit to cause us some more grief
one of those mate
they overheard our radio chat
they still don 't know what bank it was
300 grand ?
more like 3 million
UNknown we have to meet
i UNknown l make you a cocktail and we UNknown l have a roll in the hay for old times sake
probably have your men keeping lookout for me now
you 'r e not in a position to play games UNknown
no threats please tim
for your own good
that 's what i promised
christ what a UNknown !
and now the particular bank has been identified the story will be all over the news
we UNknown e heard it already is
if we don 't get onto the case quickly the police will have nabbed these robbers and god knows what will happen to our photographs
philip get over to the bank
take control of the situation
where is she ?
good news is she 's arranged a meet
that is good news
it 's all over the news
they found the location of the bank
so what ?
there 's been a robbery
we know there 's been a robbery that 's why we 'r e all here
you 'r e a long way off your patch
regional crime squad now
pretty cheeky that radio bit
these UNknown talkie robbers certainly caught your lot on the hop
makes us all look stupid
you got any idea who could have done this ?
none of my informers
if you would like to give us an UNknown list of the content of your boxes we may be able to UNknown
are you mad ? what 's missing
the whole point in having a safe deposit box is so that people like you don 't know what 's in it !
i want to speak to a roy given
yeah that 's me
i want everybody out
they all got the same tailor and they all went to the same bloody school
let 's get some copies of the UNknown talkie UNknown out to the news boys
maybe the public can help identify the villains
so tell me
both of us
accounts have to be balanced records kept
and i wouldn 't likely keep the books around here now would i ?
spell it out lew
i UNknown e ever made to you and your colleagues
it was in my safety deposit box and i think we can safely assume it 's now in the possession of the robbers
for fuck 's sake
why do you ask ?
i 'm afraid all your stuff will be gone
you want box 118 tim
you have no idea of the danger you and your chums are in do you ?
is that right ?
you UNknown e opened pandora 's box you dumb prick that 's why
i know what 's at stake
and i know how expendable we are
some change in the deal
oh is that right ?
we UNknown l get indemnity fresh passports safe passage out of the country
for the whole team
you can 't be serious ?
you can bet your UNknown i 'm serious
i want it signed and delivered by a public figure of substantial authority
how about the prime minister ?
yeah he UNknown l do if you can drag him off his yacht
you mess with us tim
we can drip feed pictures like this to the press
we UNknown e got a stack of UNknown m
oh do you ?
we UNknown l be in touch
apparently there is a whole rose gallery stored in one of those boxes
if lord UNknown is up to his usual UNknown UNknown strange sex life that 's his problem
this operation is about recovering the photos from michael x
might it not be prudent to get the committee to consider issuing a d notice ?
defence notice to protect national secrets
to protect everyone UNknown embarrassed by this criminal activity which we UNknown
buddies of him
i thought at the time he looked a bit UNknown
christ is that thing real ?
i UNknown e got it
dave shilling ?
about what ?
from what i see most of it is corrupt UNknown and vile
and i am just saying this so that you know that i don 't have a better nature to appeal to or a compassionate streak
i mean you do understand don 't you ?
i think so mr vogel
i could use a couple of those myself
you stole from me and from friends of mine
where is my stuff ?
i don 't know
i would love to say this is not going to hurt but it is
what are you going to do ?
please no !
why is the door open ?
who are you ?
you better run along eh ? transcript by r o g a r d
get yourselves a cup of tea or something

they said if i want to see dave or eddie again then you UNknown l have to call
listen to me i swear to you we UNknown l get them back
don 't you worry darling
have you got a pen ?
ring a bell ?
pulled rank on my tame copper
why do you suppose these people would be interested in the robbery of a minor neighbourhood bank michael ?
i don 't know
how do you know that ?
because on this point i believe my captive
no man could withstand the pain we inflicted on him
so don 't take me for a fool michael !
you UNknown e UNknown this calamity by UNknown your blackmail materials in this bank
which you recommended
get my pictures back or you will never see a black man on the streets of london without wondering if he 's been sent to kill you !
what are you doing ?
oh hello michael
i know what you UNknown e been looking for
you won 't find it
what are you talking about ?
surely you can pull some strings
you 'r e a minister in the government for god 's sake !
sonia i really don 't think i am able to help here
perhaps you don 't fully comprehend
i have photographs UNknown photographs
live filmed of you
you all know each other if that 's any consolation
you UNknown e got photographs of me ?
you conniving cunt !
now is the time to talk to your white hall chums don 't you think ?
that 's him
did a stretch in the UNknown prison a few years back
i thought he was a UNknown
spoke with some UNknown accent
thank you sir very much
terry leather kevin swain UNknown love eddie burton
yeah mr shilling was kind enough to speak with me about this
you put dave on the phone
now i would but he seems a bit indisposed at the moment
a ledger with a dark red cover
and some photos that i 'm sure the UNknown 5 is interested in
the royal UNknown
then i suggest you look again
speak to your friends
eddie it 's terry
listen to me eddie
you UNknown e got to help
eddie what am i supposed to do ?
you tell him we don 't have it !
payments made to soho and west end division officers
there are weekly UNknown
nothing like this was supposed to happen
no one was supposed to get hurt
it 's not your fault right ?
we still got our own exit to think about and eddie
if we give the photos to vogel all bets are off with tim
if we deliver it to tim it 's eddie 's neck and vogel is still after us
either way we are fucked
miles we UNknown e got a problem a serious problem
something sonia UNknown kept in the bank that was robbed over the weekend
she is concerned that her safe deposit box may have been plundered
i 'm afraid her fears are well justified
oh my god
for both of us UNknown ?
not quite yet
then give them what they want
already in motion
to UNknown silence the press
put a lid on it
big pity wouldn 't it ?
well if your mates abandoned you over a few photographs
you go ahead and kill him we don 't give a shit
we got our loot
we 'r e sending them over
don 't do that
there 's a UNknown near the statue of the soldier
have eddie with you hale and hearty
this is your one and only chance vogel
don 't blow it

some blokes were tough at dave
how bad ?
what have you done to us ?
wendy i promise i 'm gonna work this out

but if anything goes wrong use this
there is plenty of cash
pounds francs dollars
you can do this if you have to wendy
my share yeah
UNknown so was she involved ?
oh and did you sleep with her terry ?
i did know that from day one

and i have stood by you and i will stand by you no matter what !
you bastard !!
yell at me
and the kids
if you UNknown l still have me

lord UNknown has graciously agreed to represent the interest of the crown in this matter
is he high enough up the tree ?
he has to be under the main clock UNknown station 11 am or no deal and with your new passports and documents
he 's gonna hand them over as soon as he sees the photos
there 's another problem
the guts come with the glory eh ?
one of our mates has been killed

the proceeds and the piss UNknown are both yours to deal with
what for ?

you 'r e a spy sent to steal from me

if that news could disappear so could we
if everything goes to plan ?
i UNknown l tell you if you 'r e coming with me
it 's very important
no i prefer to tell him myself
look all i 'm saying is if you 'r e interested in the rest of this book of UNknown the author 's gonna be at UNknown station
and how exactly did this come into your possession ?
there 's your friend tim

UNknown subs http subtitles ee UNknown subs UNknown translate !
you know after last year 's corporate my wife was always encouraging me
you know she said you did fine you did fine in the corporate
i was a bit nervous
this little guy hello
nice background with the people there
we are here at the must i look ?
just look straight at the lens
we are here at the
UNknown head office
and behind me you can see the alien affairs workers
and what we do here at this department is we try to engage with the UNknown on behalf of UNknown and on behalf of humans
it just UNknown there
we were on the verge of first contact
the whole world was watching
expecting i don 't know music from heaven and bright shining lights
oh my god !
there was a lot of international pressure on us at the time
the entire world was looking at johannesburg so we had to do the right thing
the government then established an aid group that started to ferry the aliens to a temporary camp set up just beneath the ship
we didn 't have a plan
there was a million of them
so what was a temporary holding zone soon became UNknown became UNknown
and before we knew it it was a slum
but the truth is nobody really knew what this place was
there 's a lot of secrets in district 9
at first a lot of attention was given to giving the aliens a proper status and protection
they 'r e spending so much money to keep them here
when they could be spending it on other things but at least they 'r e keeping them separate from us
i want to be realistic with everyone
the aliens will not be able to go home
the aliens are here to stay
i don 't know
we look for it
more energy weapon UNknown found
the special task force conducted raids in district 9
where there 's a weapon there 's crime
UNknown rose and rose
residents in UNknown UNknown for the third UNknown night in an attempt to remove all the aliens from their UNknown
i think they must fix that ship and they must go
a virus a UNknown virus
release it near the aliens
they must just go
if they was from another country we might understand
but they are not even from this planet
the government have enforced a UNknown curfew
the aliens UNknown they take my wife away
the UNknown term UNknown is used for the alien and obviously it UNknown something that is a bottom UNknown that UNknown the leftovers
i mean you can 't say they don 't look like that
that 's what they look like right ?
they look like UNknown
one bystander was hurt
they can take the UNknown you are wearing off you
they take whatever you have on you
your cell phone or anything
after that they kill you
and now after 20 years public pressure had forced the government to shift the aliens out of johannesburg
they had had enough and they wanted district 9 to be moved and more UNknown UNknown and controlled
so to enforce this mass eviction the government turned to UNknown
welcome all and thank you for coming
please listen very closely to this briefing
today we start a very complex and delicate operation
this is the largest operation that UNknown has ever UNknown and we believe that it is going to be UNknown successfully
it is to move 1 8 million UNknown from their present home in district 9 to a safer and better location 200 kilometers outside of johannesburg city
we built a nice new facility where the UNknown can go he can be comfortable he can stay there
the people of johannesburg and of south africa are going to live happily and safely knowing that that UNknown is very far away
UNknown protocol dictates that we give the aliens 24 hours notice of our right to evict
today you will serve these notices getting the aliens to sign i 27 form
the UNknown that UNknown is using to evict the aliens is simply a whitewash
i 'm going to appoint a field officer to take direct command
UNknown van de UNknown
that was my UNknown just
feels like life on the big stage
thank you UNknown
that didn 't affect my decision to promote him
it 's almost as big as my wedding day
you know not as big
UNknown was always making me things
he said that way they just mean so much more
he left this paper UNknown bowl on the sofa one day and i didn 't see it and i sat down and i kinda UNknown it
they took all his stuff away for the investigation and
i made them bring it all back
hey congratulations man !
here 's the shake
this is trent
if he can make it today eh ?
i UNknown l make it
i just want everyone watching this right now to learn from what has happened
you would think things like this would happen to somebody else not to me
how is it going man ?
long time mate
hey boss !
i 'm all right boss
good good this is UNknown
he is training with us today
i think i was disgusted with the way he worked
there was always just a hint of something not quite kosher with mr van de UNknown
nobody saw it coming at all
none of us had any idea of what he was doing
i think it is a great thing to see that it 's not the military guys in charge this time
not to say that UNknown and his cowboys are not wanted
you guys are always wanted
you see now these are the cowboys
they shoot first and then they answer the questions
sorry is this above the UNknown amount of ammunition ?
because i see your UNknown are full but
i think maybe you should speak to the colonel
f a g over here says that we got too much ammunition
no all i 'm saying UNknown is that you know you should find ways of making you guys more efficient
listen to me you fuck !
get him outta my face
there are rules we 'r e all living by rules in this world
well i don 't think he can be forgiven for what he did cause it 's like a betrayal
i UNknown e gotta get going les
i think we 'r e gonna have to cut this interview cause we 'r e gonna go
12 UNknown from UNknown 9
take your magazines people
so we have to come there and say listen this is our land
please will you go ?
it 's difficult to put the vest on by yourself
thomas can you help me ?
all right boss
thomas just look on the side if there 's a vest there ?
i 'm just concerned about my family
don 't worry about the vest it UNknown l be fine
rights groups have demanded that UNknown should comply with all UNknown regulations in district 9
we 'r e coming to you from the entrance of district 9 as today UNknown national united sets out to UNknown approximately 1 8 million alien residents from their homes
human rights groups are keeping a watchful eye as many suspect UNknown might occur
we 'r e seeing heavily armed private security forces being deployed into district 9
backed up by significant air support
we UNknown l go shack to shack and get them to sign the form
first one ex 247
the operation is about to begin
just stay focused
what is it ?
this is only the beginning of a total clamp down
this is UNknown agents
open up !
we are here to serve you an eviction notice
you just put your UNknown there
fuck off !
because as he hit it it counts as a UNknown
first time we come in there will always be a little bit of tension happening between us and them
hey you can 't eat that man !
the UNknown likes to eat the rubber
to him it 's like a UNknown
no no !
did you see that ?
right in the roost
stop it !
don 't shoot or you 'r e gonna turn it into a UNknown !
what is that ?
no it 's cat food
it is cat food
no it 's not my house
i don 't live here
well that 's a pity because you know this
this is a nice cat food you know
but of course it 's not your house
so we UNknown l just have to go and give it to someone else
we need you to sign here
now you can take that
something about it like UNknown for cats
only a lot more intense
what is eviction ?
they will take commands they have no initiative
they UNknown e lost all the apt of leadership through whatever cause
we presume illness
where there 's a slum there 's crime
and district 9 was no exception
the UNknown had various UNknown going
one of them was the cat food scam
where they sold cat food to the aliens for UNknown prices
you put the money here first
you don 't get anything until you pay
what are you trying to do ?
i UNknown l chop your balls off
not to mention UNknown prostitution and they also dealt in alien UNknown
you have a car UNknown there 's a chop shop there you can see that that 's somebody 's car in there
the UNknown in district 9 are headed by a man called UNknown
he 's a very powerful underground figure in johannesburg
you don 't want to play with these boys
they will cut you into pieces
that 's the boss there
ok no problem
this is gonna cause problems
all right next
control this is UNknown van de UNknown
i need a population control team at UNknown 766 immediately please
check the other side thomas !
there is 40 to 50 eggs in here
is this normal ?
i can just show you a little bit how it works
basically a cow is hung from the ceiling you can see here
very little of it left of course because all these pipes supply the UNknown to the little UNknown eggs
you can do one i can show you want to see ?
no i 'm fine
then finally we take air back
the little guy is gone to a nice little sleep now
you pop him out there we go
pop him out here
you can feel like you did one of these here
this is the snake
so this makes a lot of sense
you hear that ?
it 's almost like a popcorn
what the egg does it pops up
the little guy what 's left of him pops out there
so that 's the sound that you 'r e hearing with the popping
you don 't need that man
only UNknown wear that
what are you doing with this television set sir ?
what 's this ?
that 's a first day find
that 's a big find
you see this ?
there 's weapons all over here
UNknown 5 UNknown
UNknown is trying to move the aliens for UNknown reasons
but the real focus just as it has been right from the beginning is weapons
UNknown is the second largest weapons manufacturer in the world
we assumed that we 'd be able to pick up the alien UNknown gun and just be able to shoot but it didn 't work like that
because as we discovered their technology is actually engineered in a biological manner to UNknown exclusively with their dna
it just doesn 't work with humans
and it 's as simple as that
this is basically a guy and there 's 3 humans here
basically trying to make a warning you know
he 's saying i kill 3 humans watch out for me
hey don 't UNknown on your own bloody get back get back
this is UNknown requesting first battalion escort please
you want to talk to them or you want to talk to me ?
no not them !
yeah i know he had a spade
look i find some !
i tell you before this is human technology it is useless
only our technology contains the fluid
this is not our technology ?
no it 's junk
good little one
because it is very difficult so much can go wrong
twenty years of work
quiet listen they are coming
you must hide this
answer the door and be polite
this is the gang sign
you see this ?
UNknown you just stay back
you stay behind thomas
i will be searched
don 't make them angry be polite !
UNknown agents open the door please
okay that 's UNknown
get out !
just stay there !
do you understand it ?
we 'r e gonna find weapons here
watch your head don 't hit the cows
just checking for UNknown
yeah it 's hollow there
it 's almost like a chemistry type of a set
it 's gotta be something
i don 't know this has got the markings there of so it is definitely alien
but it 's not a weapon
but i don 't trust it
are you all right ?
UNknown are you all right ?
switch it off please
yeah don 't worry
it has a fuel in and i suspect it might leak onto people or cause damage
so we just check that in and we take that down nicely to the lab
it 's not a weapon but it 's dangerous
he 's got weapons somewhere here my sense is telling me that
lets check the other side here
ok i got it sir !
keep the gun on him thomas there 's weapons here !
oh this is christmas !

and have been trying to for many many years
give them one hundred cans

without the ability to use them
fuck off !
i just want to talk
talk about what ?
UNknown is a south african word
today it 's UNknown with UNknown and magic

untie the fucking gun
i want to try this
everybody standing by
gentlemen we are running out of time
this is the key stage in the UNknown
his dna is in perfect balance between alien and human
and a problem is as the infection spreads the transition becomes permanent and less active
he 's going to turn into one of them
a UNknown !
what 's important is that we harvest from him what we can right now
this body represents hundreds of millions maybe billions of dollars worth of UNknown
there are people out there governments UNknown who 'd kill for this chance
will he survive the procedure ?
no of course not
please help me
i UNknown l handle that
okay i say let 's go
good thank you
he just hurt his arm dad
the doctors are trying sweetheart
doing their best to save him
we 'r e starting to harvest material from the specimen

we need to get the heart out as quickly as possible
once it set the UNknown it just spread
you know UNknown
i UNknown l go through the chest go straight into the heart

i need to speak to tania straight away please
it 's my house
i 'm UNknown what ?
he tried calling me
it 's me !
fuck off !
fuck off !
a special medical help
he became the most valuable business UNknown on earth
he was the only human who had ever successfully been combined with alien UNknown and remained alive
but his real value was that he could operate alien UNknown
we interrupt this program to bring you breaking news
a patient has escaped from the isolation ward and is loose in the city
UNknown van de UNknown was recently apprehended after prolonged sexual activity with aliens in district 9
this is nonsense
that is totally untrue
if i could just buy my burger please
don 't listen to them !
it 's highly contagious and the police warns people to stay at least 20 meters away from this man
don 't look at this hand !
this hand is fine !
if you have any information regarding the whereabouts of mr van de UNknown contact us immediately on UNknown stop UNknown
please leave a message
the entire world was watching him
he was on every radio station every image on television anything you could find had his face on it
so he had nowhere else to go
he ended up hiding in the one place he knew no one would ever come looking for him
40 hours after exposure
no money you get nothing
fucking UNknown this isn 't charity
hello i 'd like to buy some meat please
hey a man !
does it look like a hamburger shop ?

there is a way out of this
we get the fluid back from UNknown
yeah and what then ?

all right ?
i can 't wait to see our planet
it 's bigger than this one isn 't it ?
see that tent there ?
that might be ours
we can 't go home
they 'r e smaller than the shacks
actually more like a concentration camp
if i can get you that black fluid what happens then ?
we go up to the UNknown
and you can start that thing ?
this is gonna go back to human like this
i can go home and then you can go home
you can take your boy you can take all the UNknown if i can get you that fluid right ?

but you know what ?

i 'm gonna just fuckin kill you myself

stay back !
it 's the first time ladies and gentlemen in over two decades that the UNknown has shown any sign of movement and people are tremendously excited
the city had come to an absolute UNknown
everybody wants to know what 's going to happen next
there 's no way of knowing whether or not christopher johnson will return
and we can only speculate as to what has happened to him
the more UNknown conspiracy theories state that he 's been captured by UNknown or by another government
or by perhaps some shady government agency and he 's actually being held in captivity
if we knew where he was we would try and help him and that is the most difficult part not knowing where he is
UNknown sadly is gone but i 'm the one who stays behind with all the questions
i can 't give the answers
he died in my mind a long time ago
and that 's that
he was an honest man and he didn 't deserve any of what happened to him
i mean i know
i mean the whole data was there you know ?
they didn 't even do a good job of hiding it
UNknown UNknown is currently awaiting trial for exposing UNknown 's illegal genetic research program
district 9 was demolished after the alien UNknown operation was completed
district 10 now houses 2 5 million aliens and continues to grow
you guys haven 't seen a picture of my wife
let me show you my wife
she 's my special angel
she even looks like an angel with veil you want to see that ?
look you see with the white veil over the she even looks like an angel
everyone says that his wife is angel but this is a real angel that you see there on the cameras
they won 't put that in the video i don 't think
i found this at my front door
as UNknown somebody had just left it there
my friends say that i should throw it away cause it 's just a piece of rubbish
that it couldn 't possibly come from him
i know it 's true
he 's not next door he 's behind me
i ain 't never even seen him
who are your neighbors then
UNknown UNknown and his brother UNknown ?
i said come back here !
who 's there ?
are you spying me ?
no i 'm working on my mud fort what are you doing ?
i 'm planting vegetables
i have to live somewhere
why don 't you go inside so i get done working on my garden
it can 't be transmitted through the air
just to be on the safe side i think you should go inside
but i 'm working on my mud ford
hey what would you do if i come over there and whoop your ass ?
how long would that take ?
about ten seconds
you mean you just let me beat you up ?
i 'd try to stop you but i probably won 't be able to
i 'm not very big
in that case it would only take 5 seconds
so is that what you 'r e gonna do ?
i warned you what would happen if you get all dirty again
one two three a winner !
there some boys outside playing baseball you can go make the effort to get to know them it UNknown l be very nice
i 'm gonna go out with some girls from the office tonight so put yourself a dinner in UNknown
have you thought anymore about colorado ?
i 'm not going to camp !
yeah but if you just give it a chance you meet some extra friends
why can 't i go see dad ?
we UNknown l call him if he says yes
i UNknown l put you on the next plane
you know you and his little friend cindy can go to the movies and get UNknown m for half price !
she 's 23 mom !
amazing old enough to drink !
yeah but she doesn 't
you know it 's not good to spend too much times with these games
i have nothing against fishing but i 'm not touching the worms
i UNknown l take care the worms
yeah we UNknown l see about that
i guess it 's a lot for baby
my grandmother said you 'r e going to hell she says you UNknown l suffer eternal torture of a billion flames hotter than the center of the sun
then she must be some kind of genius
your grandmother knows she must be a genius
she 's a clerk at k mart
maybe she 's just an UNknown
no she 's an idiot
maybe i won 't go to hell after all
are you sure those germs of yours don 't travel through the air ?
yeah why ?
well if you look at the lower limit of what 's consider normal for my age
i 'm only 4 inches shorter
why don 't you just eat whenever you 'r e hungry ?
cause if i only eat whenever i was hungry i won 't be here
do you wanna go to peterson 's ?
what is that ?
in my bedroom
you wanna burn him ?
where did you get it all ?
allowance and UNknown
this is great since i know where the store is
i UNknown l be a the navigator and you UNknown l be treasurer
what 's a treasurer will do ?
he carries all the money and pays for things
i 'm to supposed to pay for both of us ?
i 'm UNknown for both of us you want to be fair don 't you ?
how far is peterson 's ?
it 's mean the depths of the water would be the key
obviously in the middle of the ocean the shark will win
and on dry land the lion will win
so how much water are we talking about ?
2 and a half feet
and how big is the shark ?
cause they did research on stanford university the shark won easily
they just let two animals killed each other at the college ?
no you idiot they just had a fight long enough to see who 's gonna win and the trainers pulled them apart
never heard a shark on a leash
or there 's a lot of things you UNknown e never heard of
i guess that 's true
that means it goes to my dad he still in new orleans
what does he do ?
you UNknown e ever heard a rock group called led zeppelin ?
your dad ?
for a UNknown UNknown am
you know what you 'r e gonna get ?
i don 't know it 's been a long time since i UNknown e any candy
my mom has me eats a lot of vegetables
of course !
get out of the road !
you missed !
you guys took a wrong turn this is a no UNknown zone
i ain 't a UNknown !
and neither is he !
he got from a blood transfusion
what is that awful smell ?
we 'r e simply walkin across the grass we accidentally stepped in your mother
what did you say ?
you can 't hit it us all with that !
i only be aiming it at you
come on then
what about him ?
daddy take him to the hospital he could UNknown e caught something in
yeah but he didn 't
but he could UNknown e !
then everybody be calling him UNknown and queer and he 'd get sick and die !
and you got UNknown on his UNknown and when your mother went to bring him flowers she would see her little eddie horner UNknown
i 'm sorry you 'r e sick
get UNknown m !
ma 'a m get out of the way !
move it !
why the hell not !
they 'r e nice to me at the hospital and they play games with me
you play games with UNknown ?
just talk about something else
sometimes i don 't know about you
what 's that supposed to mean ?
i think i should go take a nap
we should work on the mud fort tomorrow you want to ?
i don 't get home for dinner that often when i do i want us to be together
it 's part being a family isn 't it ?
some woman saw that little UNknown boy down at the peterson yesterday
it 's in the newspaper ?
the other day i heard him coughing
i said i heard him coughing
oh well you don 't have to worry about anything with that fence there not could catch anything
what if wants to come over and play ?
oh erik think of some excuse you 'r e so good at that
what if i bump into him out in the street ?
well it 's common sense you just keep a safe distance
what 's a safe distance ?
7 feet guess that rule out sleep over
my mom wants you to come to dinner
well mom 's working late so cool
well there 's something i have to warn you about
you want some more carrots sweetie ?
we probably yeah i bet
you didn 't even finish your UNknown muffin !
will you shut up !
she 's not gonna hear me sweetheart !
you don 't worry about it sweetie she 's not gonna hear me !
here we go !
yeah well i did but i have to dump her
UNknown UNknown UNknown
yes as they get settled in their new apartment
i maybe goin down there
and how 's your mom feel about this
actually we haven 't really talk it out much yet
well i 'd love to meet her
she works quite a bit
20 22 hours a day
what she do ?
the one downtown
25 cents and this !
are you gonna finish that ?
well doctor says it 's completely safe but when it comes to other people 's children we UNknown e decided not to take any chances
just as soon as they find the cure we 'r e headin out to UNknown robbins and ordering one of those monster UNknown where everybody digs and rotting in
it 's a good plan
what is it ?
hey what if they don 't find the cure ?
i 'm sure they will eventually
but what if they 'r e looking in the wrong place ?
what do you mean ?
have you ever seen that movie medicine man ?
i tell you where it might be flowers leaves maybe even pine could have
it can 't hurt to try !
my mom has me eat lots of vegetables especially UNknown
i ever eat is candy and i never get sick
hey that 's it !
somebody gets sick and all they eat is fruits and vegetables it 's the one thing they stop eating !

it 's a grownup thing
they can 't know we haven 't always lived here
but that 's lying !
no i 'm not asking you to lie
just don 't UNknown about meaningless things
an electric train !
you met her and you 'r e having dinner
after what happened i 'd want to know
no my friend
tonight i UNknown l try to ask her
i UNknown l arrange it so you 'r e alone
just a second
what 's that ?
what did you get him ?
an electric train
for when you have kids
how many UNknown ?
babs nothing has changed
i haven 't
it 's so much fun here i couldn 't sleep
look at my train !
you can play tomorrow
watch out !
quiet down grandpa !
so did it work ?
how nice of you to call
oh you 'r e not alone
i did some investigating
he 's doctor
this is interesting !
don 't let him get away
no don 't worry
goodnight uncle henri
yes he 's sleeping
well he is yours
who is this uncle henri that pierre seems so fond of ?
is he a friend of the family ?
he 's a nice man
i 'm sorry
it 's okay george
what have you been up to ?
i UNknown e been healing others
i can 't complain
life is strange
i was strong and free
what were you doing ?
oh the train UNknown
i 'm very sorry
i think it 's in the kitchen
no let me !
at the cinema remember ?
i was holding your hand
it 's so sad
you could be a detective
that 's good
try to control yourself !
we 'r e not alone
what is it ?
i UNknown l be back
it drove me crazy !
i had no choice
for years not a word not a sign nothing
i never betrayed you
yes i believe you
we should let evelyne rest
it 's late
you should send for an electrician because i 'm not an expert
i 'm going to the country to find a school for pierre
see you tomorrow !
your husband too
i UNknown l wait for your answer
we look married
where should we go now ?
he can wait
i don 't know
a doctor would never say that
he 'd say it will take time i UNknown l be back tomorrow
it will take time
do you also care for birds ?
no i don 't
they stayed at the apartment without any food
what apartment ?
where is this apartment ?
let me think
how is it ?
no the fuel line is blocked
now we 'r e stuck in the forest
what can we do ?
i don 't know
look a furnace !
no not like that !
leave it to me
it 's so cold !
my feet are freezing !
put them near the fire
that will cause UNknown
and after it stopped snowing we took that path to town
with all the pine trees
let 's not think of what could have been
right let 's forget it
life begins today okay ?
i 'm not the same woman
yes you are babs !
nothing else matters to me
that 's what i wanted to tell you
and that 's why i stopped the car
you did it on purpose ?
without a second thought
isn 't it nice here ?
everything is far away
when a couple fall in love it 's like the world begins again
so you think i love you ?
i 'm convinced
she still lives here
then it can 't be the same person
there 's only one madam morin
she works at the UNknown and has a boy named pierre
yes that 's her
yes gustav and josephine
is she coming back tomorrow ?
i 'm not sure
i think so
but what do you expect ?
she has to earn a living
as long as she pays the rent and she doesn 't bring back any men i don 't care
come inside !
and not let the world touch our happiness
but that would be difficult
the world can 't hurt us
we were lost
nothing will change that
this old room looks beautiful because we 'r e here
it will be always like this
right dear ?
in a house far from the city
i don 't see why not
well i have a home and my life here
it 's not something you do in 24 hours
fine i can wait
no you should leave tomorrow
i UNknown l meet up with you in two weeks with pierre
hey since you 'r e going to be so busy
let pierre go with me
you want to take him ?
why would you do that ?
i UNknown l be there as soon as i can
listen have you ever seen a mother separated from her child ?
who just gives him to anyone ?
just anyone ?
first i UNknown l drop you off
i UNknown l stop by the UNknown and i UNknown l pick you up in an hour for lunch with armand
babs i have you now
this time i won 't lose you
you understand ?
come on !
i said i would
i gave him the address and he got them
get dressed dear
while i was gone did a man come ask for me ?
yes he picked up the birds
did he ask about me ?
he seemed to know you so we talked a bit
what did you tell him ?
i don 't remember
you said that !
it 's not your fault
was that wrong ?
did you already tell george ?
listen let me explain
it 's perfectly clear to me
sorry to ruin your little plan
what plan ?
everything i UNknown e done has been for george
come on please !
it won 't work
i 'm not asking for anything else
i 'm not expecting anything
i used my last strength to lie to him to be the woman he knew ten years ago
i know i 'm not that woman
but you have no right to tell him
you weren 't better back then
you don 't treat a man the way you did !
i didn 't have a choice
when i met george i was already married
he never knew and i couldn 't tell him
why not ?
he was my husband
a great catch my parents said
he got arrested six months later
i ran off and was going to get a divorce
then i met george
we were happy
then one night we were at the cinema
they brought me a note
it was my husband
he had found me and he was coming to get me
we 'r e finished !
so leave me alone !
get in !
i said get in !
i UNknown e moved on
that 's why i came
your boyfriend is in there
we UNknown l deal with him
i UNknown l do whatever you want
i knew he was capable of anything
that same evening we left canada
in france life went on until that mishap which left me all alone after what happened
i thought of writing to george but i didn 't dare
the bar and the rest
i don 't want george to find out
i don 't have the strength to lie anymore to him
yesterday i could but i can 't anymore
he asked me to marry him
he wants to take us with him
you you 'r e his friend
you have to convince him to leave by himself
i UNknown l tell him that i can 't meet up with him
that i thought it over and i didn 't feel the same
i don 't know !
don 't you want to tell him the truth ?
no never !
that 's why he must leave tonight
you must never tell him
i beg of you
a colony in the UNknown
you know that ?
so what 's wrong ?
your 35 grand and the canadian yes ?
kiss it goodbye
but now he 's packing
he reserved two cabins for tonight !
probably to get him to stay
we better act quick
why are you sick ?
i UNknown l cure you
say ahh !
a little while ago
do you realize how much this has cost me ?
i don 't care how
if you can 't handle classy men i UNknown l put you somewhere else
try to be more cordial
in any case i UNknown l be here
if you 'd rather be a UNknown
oh whatever you want
you hear me ?
who do you think you are ?
you do what i want !
where i want !
don 't look at me like that !
you got that ?
i UNknown l find out if you were cheating me
be ready tomorrow night and you better shape up !
you 'r e not a baby
don 't be scared
will that nasty man come back ?
you UNknown l never hear him again
i promise you
oh yes mom
big like the normandy ?
sure i want to go !
where is the boat going ?
far away dear
where people are happy
where you won 't be afraid dear
yes we UNknown l meet him at the station
the hospital back home must think i 'm crazy
first i 'm staying two more weeks then i 'm coming right away
so it 's settled then ?
you won 't change your mind ?
it 's settled
hey do you like trains ?
yes but it 's smaller than our boat
and there aren 't any elevators
how many horses ?
and be sure he wears warm clothes
he 's in your care both of yours
yes don 't worry
armand has over 200 kids under his care
yes i know but one child is more difficult
it won 't be for very long
that 's true
come here dear
oh yes !
be a good strong boy
and make me proud
i UNknown l see you soon
don 't be sad
i UNknown l never leave you again
i would have gone and never told the truth
besides everybody lies and for lesser things
i don 't have the strength
for three days it 's possible
but to lie for a lifetime
i UNknown l never go back there
let 's go to the UNknown
come on !
soon he UNknown l be waking up in the middle of the ocean
it will be a sunny morning with UNknown flying
he UNknown l be happy
he UNknown l cry out for you
oh not for too long
he UNknown l be distracted by everything around him
i UNknown l keep getting further away into the mist
what are you thinking ?
i 'd like to slip into the mist
is that for me ?
no it 's for the manager
henri i 'd like another cognac
you UNknown e drunk enough
okay i UNknown l get one
waiter one more !
i UNknown l try to call him again
did long distance call for me ?
she 's my wife
i 'm not shouting !
yes i want to contact the ship !
please it 's urgent !
that 's right
it 's always right but never enough
it never is
his mother had mailed us to say that he will not be able to continue his studies
one student less for you this month
i 'm afraid
i wish to find the light that i UNknown e lost
life seems insignificant
i don 't trust my illusion anymore
i can 't find the moment that i want to live in
but i imagine it every moment
here you go have a nice day
i wish i find the life that i UNknown e lost
this is not working
this is not working that i UNknown e lost
i don 't want this
why do the moments feel on a UNknown ?
what 's the UNknown that i feel in my eyes ?
i can 't find the moment that i want to live in
but i imagine it every moment
it 's somewhere that doesn 't exist
it 's somewhere that doesn 't exist
i will give the money back
i just need some time
please try and understand
i thought you must be tired
that 's why i prepared soup and vegetable noodles
you won 't have to cook
whatever happened this morning won 't happen again
stay away from me
i 'm just going through a bad phase
and there 's someone that 's been supporting you
in this bad phase and that 's me
at every step at every phase
i 'm sorry UNknown
i hate being embarrassed
i was thinking UNknown there 's one way to solve our problems
there 's just the two of us living in such a big house
we don 't need all this space
what if we sell it and buy a smaller house ?
i mean we UNknown l get more money after selling this
and i UNknown l invest that money in my business
i will not sell this house rajiv
this is the only UNknown left of my mom and dad
i can 't
ls it really about your mom and dad or don 't you trust me anymore ?
i UNknown e already given you all the money that i had
and you lost everything in your business
i UNknown e nothing left other than this house
it 's my only security
you feel more secure in your house than with your husband
because homes don 't change rajiv but sometimes the people that live in it do
your son 's violin teacher
you look lndian
it so strange we stay so close but never met each other
our lives have become so busy that we hardly get any time for ourselves
would you like some ?
i was at work and UNknown was at school
she slipped on the stairs and fell really badly and she couldn 't even get up and call us
she lay there until UNknown returned home
then he called me and we rushed her to the hospital
i 'm so sorry mrs smith
it 's my fault for putting too much varnish on the stairs
my husband is serving in the middle east with the royal marines
and i work for 10 hours a day
and now my mother in law can 't fetch UNknown from the violin classes
and the treatment the cost for UNknown and amongst these we can 't afford UNknown 's violin classes
what if i come here and teach him ?
i 'm not asking you for money
why are you doing all this for us ?
UNknown is very talented mrs smith
just like a student requires a good teacher
a teacher needs a good student as well
as far as money is concerned
who doesn 't need money ?
but the desire to make my student a successful musician is far greater
you can take the girl out of lndia
but you cannot take lndia out of the girl
rajiv i was thinking we UNknown e such a big house
why don 't we rent out a part of the house ?
this way we UNknown l have some income every month and
are you listening ?
and we can make our ends meet
what do you think ? whatever you wish
rajiv you 'r e either part of the problem or part of the solution
open to UNknown
yes it is
i 'm a singer
it 's a part time job
and full time ?
and i practise part time
i want to be a part of the royal phil UNknown solo
it 's a very difficult exam
can you afford the rent here ?
and 1 1 2 years rent in advance
then i will have to sing some extra songs
actually there 's a lot of difference between a house and a home
lf we can find our country men our food our god our food everything far from our country
then it becomes a home
and a home is invaluable
what do you think ?
he seems like a good man
think about it once more UNknown
we 'r e letting an unknown man stay in our house and we don 't know much about him
no one can know anyone completely rajiv
so what have you thought ?
like i said 1 1 2 years rent in advance and you UNknown l have to sign a lease contract
as you say boss
but why are you giving this to me ?
it is for your business
UNknown you keep it
and who knows one day i may end up being your paying guest
and then i may elope with your money
please forget about the past
i love you rajiv
i am very poor ; i am unemployed
love me only after i become capable of staying in this mansion
one who like this first piece of music
and the other who like the second piece of music
you are from the second category
ln a crowd too you feel lonely
you don 't believe in happiness
and there is some pain that you are hiding from the world
am i right ?
but i am definitely late
oh yes !
it is very cold and the heating is automatic
so please don 't UNknown with the controls
it is forbidden to drink take drugs and especially to bring girls here
and yes if you need anything then he is the caretaker here
just call him
but i know this much that i will never allow you to ever be unhappy
possible someone must have dropped this here
ladies and gentlemen
i don 't know why my feet are staggering ?
i try to stop but they won 't stop
i have never experienced such UNknown
i don 't know what to do what to say
i never dreamt this would ever happen
what has happened to me
are you UNknown it too ?
this beat is really thumping
now get your body pumping
i feel i have just experienced eternal happiness
i feel as if i am in love
i wonder why i feel everything to be new
i think something has happened to me
what is wrong with me ?
do you know about it ?
this beat is really thumping
now get your body pumping
this beat and this sound
ls making me go round
round and round
ls making me go round
round and round
let the beat repeat now
c 'm on move your feet now oh my love
life is so short but where do you care ?
every moment just passes by
we all are trapped in time
we have UNknown to do with this we are strangers
understand the truth
now get your body pumping
what has happened to me
are you UNknown it too ?
this beat is really thumping
now get your body pumping
i 'm in no hurry to go home
you all go
oh my foot !
and she is mr UNknown UNknown
ask me why ?
belongs to UNknown UNknown
mr UNknown UNknown
he survives on his wife 's earnings
because she wears the pants and i wear the skirt and the blouse
rajiv stop it
but there is a great wall of china between us
rajiv shut up
oh this is like a song
you can create it
buddy you sing so well
thank you for today night
thank you very much
again in the morning we will play our charade
the drama of a husband and a wife
all a drama
understand this that the fear of darkness is keeping the dawn at bay
what rajiv did today was not new for you
but you are feeling bad because he did this in front of me
lf you don 't mind shall i ask you one personal question ?
this is your house your car and your money
then why do you tolerate rajiv 's behaviour ?
i don 't understand what your fault is
UNknown it is my fault
after marrying me rajiv wanted to return to lndia
but i did not want to leave my house and go
at that time he changed his decision because of me
understand this that in some way or the other l am responsible for his condition today
he sacrificed his happiness for me
not for your happiness but he has done this for his own happiness
what do you mean ?
UNknown do you know ; you are like that old man who wants to run with a lot more burden than he can carry
don 't you think you are tired of all this ?
don 't you think you should erase this false smile from your face ?
don 't you think you need a shoulder to cry on ?
don 't you want to weep ?
don 't you wish to laugh ?
don 't you wish to be happy ?
tell me UNknown
i get restless when night falls
i will never care for my heart or god
i am defeated by my own self
my head feels as if it is about to burst
good morning buddy
i have a headache and that too a severe one
last night you drank a lot
i hope nothing UNknown happened last night
what do you mean ?
i mean i hope i didn 't UNknown after getting drunk
i don 't even remember what happened last night
we were in the club you were singing
and then directly i got up in the morning
i forgot everything
see you guys later
that 's all i have
what is all this ?
i cannot return the rent that you had given me
so you keep my ornaments in return
but please go away from here
i beg of you
that was wrong
it is not wrong to love someone
for me it is wrong
i am a married woman
a marriage which turns into a bondage is not called a marriage
UNknown this marriage may be a bondage but now this is my life
this is the truth of my life
lf i start dreaming of freedom from this bondage l will suffocate and die
i 'm asking you rajiv
what happened ?
i left home yesterday morning
i didn 't return home in the evening for dinner
i stayed out the entire night
UNknown ask my caring wife did she call me even once did she inquire about me ?
where am l ?
i had a talk with the doctor
there are no serious injuries
so there 's nothing to worry
everything will be fine in two three days
i UNknown e to fill up the insurance form
UNknown is there alcohol in the blood report ?
and how did this accident occur ?
forget it UNknown you won 't be able to hear it if i say it
UNknown i don 't have the money to pay the hospital bills
i need this insurance
and then he spent the night with a prostitute in a hotel
ln the morning she found out that he doesn 't have money
you know these girls do all this for money
that 's why because he had no money that girl had him beaten up by the hotel people
please UNknown fill this form
i don 't think i can do it
UNknown come with me
come on get down
just come don 't waste time
here catch this
come on for my sake
shall we leave ?
i saw that you can 't see your courage shattering
but people want to break your courage
that 's why i stole your fear
you want to smile
that 's why i stole your tears
you want to be happy
that 's why i stole your sorrows
your torments your problems your complaints everything
i stole everything and filled it in these balloons
now there 's just one thing that you need to do
as you 'r e close to me every happiness seems true
ln my emotions in my feelings
you dwell in my breath as well
you UNknown e filled my eyes with tears of joy
you filled my destiny with ever lasting happiness
why does my heart feel so lively ?
who has entered my life ?
who can it be ?
i belong to you
ln my emotions in my feelings
you dwell in my breath as well
as you 'r e close to me every happiness seems true
moments seem to pass by
time seems to fly by
there was a UNknown in my heart
it aroused my desires
the paths seem to have found its destination
ln my emotions in my feelings
you dwell in my breath as well
as you came closer life seemed more beautiful
as you 'r e close to me every happiness seems true
ln my emotions in my feelings
you dwell in my breath as well
i thought you would make me weaker
but you UNknown e become my strength UNknown
whenever i 'm with you l feel i can face the entire world
i 'm always with you UNknown
but as far as facing the world is concerned
and then the world will turn your strength into your weakness
don 't give anyone the chance to term this wrong
what did you say ?
how dare you ?
i left my dad 's well settled business for her sake
i UNknown e been here living UNknown just for her
and she she 's talking about leaving me
rajiv shut up
you wanted to marry me as well
it 's not about marriage it 's about divorce
i could UNknown e left you in the condition you were
you 'r e the reason for my plight
what else do i UNknown e left except for my house ?
you UNknown e lost everything
i 'm also a human being
don 't i have the right to live ?
no you don 't
what do you think ?
what do you think ?
UNknown leave the room
UNknown leave the room
hire any lawyer you want ?
approach the supreme court
you will never be able to walk out on me
you heard me
mrs UNknown like to have some coffee ?
hit my head against the table and
you should take care
he 's drunk and unconscious
how will he know ?
UNknown where are we going ?
he 's got me a job in a club and also a house to stay
rajiv won 't be able to find us there
i 'm really sorry because of me
don 't be silly come on
what papers are these ?
of your house
he 's ready to buy your house and give you the money
you mean we 'r e selling the house
we 'r e eloping from this house
once we leave he can do anything he wants with the house
lf he wants he UNknown l prove you 'r e dead
and legally being your husband the entire property will belong to him
and presume that he can 't prove that you 'r e dead he UNknown l find other tenants
and then if you go back to claim your property
you UNknown l have to spend all your life fighting in court
you know that
where do i UNknown e to sign ?
but my heart doesn 't seem to agree
UNknown this just isn 't my house it 's a UNknown of my parents
it 's my childhood
this house is my family
UNknown you don 't understand
i do understand UNknown but do we have to do this now ?
a little later with a calm mind we UNknown l do what needs to be done
UNknown i 'm not a child
i know you 'r e thinking about our interest
but it 's not easy for rajiv to prove that i 'm dead
and then sooner or later we UNknown l come back to this house and
come back ?
and you 'r e talking about coming back
how will you come back ?
have you gone mad ?
UNknown i don 't want to sign on these papers here at this time
that 's it
you 'r e selfish what did you say ?
rajiv left everything he had and stayed back here for you
and i 'm ready to leave from here leaving everything behind for you
when i met you i felt there 's someone in this world
that understands me
where are you going ?
back to the house made of bricks stones and sand that understand me more than you
are you leaving ? i was leaving it
but now i 'm going back
this is UNknown police station
please help me
he 's going to kill me
hello hello hello
he 's killed my husband
that is the difference between you and me
i never asked you this when you used to come to my bedroom ?
when you wish you call me and when you wish you just tell me to go
this is not fair mrs UNknown
i am sorry UNknown
but you love this house more
you you don 't understand UNknown
this house is not just a concrete building for me
you know mrs UNknown
you can fool some people all the time
you can fool all the people sometime
but you can 't fool all the people all the time
i couldn 't sleep all night
i kept thinking that the girl for whom i was willing to leave everything that girl deserted me ?
mrs UNknown there are two kinds of lovers in this world
one who destroy themselves by drinking
and the other who destroy the one who destroyed them
it is your bad luck and my good luck
that i am the second type of a lover
i don 't want love now but i want that because of which my love was snatched away from me
you snatched my happiness from me
now i will snatch your happiness from you
you have 36 hours
these documents i will tell your husband where how and when everything happened between us
UNknown you are mind blowing
oh oh oh my god UNknown
this UNknown is the biggest comedian
his jokes he has the UNknown jokes
i am a little tired
i think i UNknown l sleep
as it is only 24 hours are left for you to lose your sleep
ghost of the betrayed lover
it is a very terrifying film
two hours !
rajiv i committed a very grave mistake
i have rajiv i have deceived you
l l and UNknown
loneliness solitude isolation and helplessness
rajiv there are many excuses
but everything is fake
rajiv l l am your culprit rajiv
you can punish me the way you wish
UNknown what happened ?
we decided to live life together
but we never realized when we got UNknown
i 'm sorry rajiv no
i 'm sorry
i will not spare you
rajiv come away from here
i will kill you
i will kill you
who the hell he thinks he is ?
rajiv don 't do anything
who the hell does he think he is ?
can you hear me ?
mr and mrs UNknown sleep peacefully tonight
because tomorrow i will deal such a blow to you and your house that you will beg for mercy
i had come to this house but now you will go away from here
mr and mrs UNknown i want this house
because your happiness lies in this house
and i wish to snatch your happiness from you
sleep well my friends
there must be some way to throw him out of the house
what if we say he is a nuisance ?
that would be difficult to prove
you have only two options
one if you can prove that he is doing something illegal
we can 't prove any such thing right now
and second ? sell the house and pay him off
that 's not an option
we UNknown l never sell this house
please see that
there is that big scratch going down at the back
that 's him
you mr UNknown ?
yes it is but may i know what is it about ?
has anyone other than you driven this car ?
no just me and my wife
has it recently been stolen ?
there is a warrant of your arrest
but what have i done ?
i UNknown l let the chief inspector explain that at the station
would you like to come with us please ?
excuse me officer
some police officers brought my husband here
what 's going on ?
last night these photographs were clicked by UNknown cameras
ls this your car ?
looks like my car
late last night the driver from this car and with this car in public property damaged three street lights one bus stop and two storm drains
and in private property he damaged four house fences two UNknown in front of the house and UNknown two cars that were parked in front of the house
our car was parked outside our house
well UNknown even you understand this that the car does not run on its own
and your husband gave a statement in front of the arresting officers that this car belongs to you and it was never missing or stolen and you were present
now you tell me what can we do ?
what can the police do in this matter ?
and most of all we have these UNknown pictures also
yes but it can also be possible that someone else must have done this ?
you mean to say that one man UNknown comes into your house late night steals the car keys and creates a chaos in the entire city ?
and he again comes and keeps the car back in place and once again goes into the house and keeps the car keys
and then he vanishes
and why will he do this ?
you are right
look here UNknown
and possible that you are not connected to these UNknown
ln such a situation i can help you in only one way
lf you pay for all the damage that has been caused l will see to it that they don 't take any action against you
i can take care of that
how much will we have to pay ?
about 8000 pounds
i am helpless
i don 't know
do you remember ?
what is this if not illegal ?
why didn 't you tell the inspector that UNknown has done all this
why were you quiet ?
lf i would tell the inspector that UNknown has done all this then what would she think ?
wouldn 't she ask me why would a tenant steal the landlord 's car ?
why will he break the law ?
what would i answer her ?
UNknown why does he want to ruin us ?
should i UNknown our image to save this house ?
oh god !
i 'm sorry
don 't blame yourself
i am to be blamed
i snatched your happiness and drifted you away from me
look at this
both of you hear and tell me how it is ?
it happened last night
one thief came in and stole their car
the thief UNknown UNknown he damaged quite a few things
mr UNknown will have to pay for that
he will be in trouble
the police arrested mr and mrs UNknown
i heard they will charge a lot ?
how did you like it ?
listen to me
this is a vast property
how much can you take care ?
a tap may remain open in the bathroom
the fuse may blow off in some bedroom
the fridge may stop working
something may fall on the carpet
the glass of the window UNknown may break sometime
there can a scratch on the piano
such a big house
at no cost will i hand this house to you
go and tell anyone what you like l will
so shall i go and tell everyone that i had seen your wife UNknown
rajiv don 't !
lf you would have shown this earlier your wife would not have had to look out for someone else
look at me
we UNknown l have to get him out of this home at any cost
but what will you do ?
the game that he 's playing with us
i know how to play that game too
tonight when he leaves for his show you keep a watch on him

you just need to call the police and tell them you saw him taking drugs
i UNknown e hidden a huge quantity of drugs the police will feel he 's a drug dealer
hope it works
fine even if i don 't have your permission l UNknown l say these few lines
the plan you devised was really good
the plan you devised was really good
but it was UNknown for me
the plan you devised was really good
but it was UNknown for me
think twice before calling the police
and take a peak below the carpet
thank you thank you
what do they say ?
oh yes meeting time is over
come on quickly
let 's not worry about what i think
you should worry about what the police will think
because now i UNknown e hidden the drugs in this house
the police will get the photographs and the drugs as well

and you UNknown l be staying in this palace
your concept of UNknown will be UNknown

like a fool you hid the drugs in the piano
she found out in a minute
you 'r e too strict
try to smile sometimes
lf i don 't return their money this time they won 't send me to the hospital but kill me
that means i UNknown l have to come up there to retrieve my money
that 's a problem
you couldn 't even get a girl to sign
what can i do ?
you UNknown e chosen such stubborn wife
she 's UNknown than you
she didn 't agree when i played a charade of love
she didn 't agree when i tried to blackmail her
now i 'm making your life hell but she isn 't ready to sign even now
what can i do ?
i can play with someone 's mind
i can play with someone 's body
but not with someone 's life
the property is worth two million pounds
lf you do my work i UNknown l give you 25 UNknown o

she thought that her husband is bigger rascal compared to her lover
and before dying she transferred the house in my name
what nonsense ?
i 'm not UNknown nonsense it 's the truth
lf you don 't believe me see it with your own eyes
jack and jill lived up the hill
jack was greedy killed jill 's spouse
now jack is homeless and i UNknown e his house
it 's a new nursery rhyme please don 't mind
i 'm sure you can teach singing to the inmates in jail
UNknown was right about one thing
i 'm a bigger rascal than you
what can i do ?
you UNknown e chosen such stubborn wife
she 's UNknown than you
she didn 't agree when i played a charade of love
she didn 't agree when i tried to blackmail her
now i 'm making your life hell
but she isn 't ready to sign even now
what can i do ?
i UNknown e lost i UNknown e lost
you 'r e the winner of this competition for scoundrels
but you lack common sense
just think if your wife can gift me such a big house
why will i kill her ?
why buddy why ?
mrs UNknown i UNknown e fulfilled my promise
your culprit is standing right before you
now you can take any decision you want
would you like to comment on your concept of UNknown before killing him ?
after all i 'm not that cold hearted
i UNknown l leave tomorrow morning
hands above your head
it is a criminal offence
lf your emergency doesn 't allow you to speak
what happened ?
he 's killed my husband now he 's trying to kill me
who killed your husband ?
UNknown UNknown !
UNknown UNknown sat on a wall
thought he was smarter than all
UNknown UNknown had a great fall
will now spend his life in a prison hall
these papers prove that he killed your husband to snatch his property
this is evidence for prosecution
1 2 3 4 very good
hey UNknown so happy to see you here
so you UNknown e been practising ?
the week is still not over
it 's not a cheque
UNknown join the class
you called at 10 30 in the night
and said someone has murdered your husband
and your life is in danger
there 's also a UNknown report in it
and according to that report your husband died at around 2 o UNknown lock in the night
both these reports are evidence to prove that you had already informed us about your husband 's death before he died
there were three copies of this report
i UNknown e already burnt two
take my advice and burn this copy after i leave
i don 't know
the first one
but over the years we made ourselves a new one
and it was to this family all of you
that his heart really belonged
it offered us protection
what makes us different
in the shadows in the light
each UNknown for meaning in a world
that won 't accept them for who they really are
they like us are blessed
gifted with extraordinary abilities
in an ordinary world
and keep them from their destiny
every one of them deserves a chance
to be who they really are
but to what end
to our family
and all who have gathered will be strong
and all who have gathered
will stand in unison
we found our way back home again
find your way home brother
yeah i guess i am
i 'm claire
send any information
oh that 's my fault
i always check those little privacy boxes for some reason
i did that same thing with my ap classmate 's profile
after i got a b plus in ap physics
are you on UNknown com ?
no i 'm not in advanced UNknown
i got my g e d
it 's not because i dropped out or anything
i was just traveling
what do your parents do ?
uh my mom breeds championship show dogs
and my dad works for the government
so that 's how you got in with a g e d
no i just got really good scores
in fenton 's UNknown algebra class then today
and the UNknown test is today at 1 00
you get in and it pretty much
sets the whole UNknown into motion you know ?
so um what 's your plan for graduate school ?
i don 't really have one
guess it 's kind of why i 'm here
no you have to go to college with a plan
how are you gonna find our future without a map ?
you have a map of your future ?
this is me in three years graduating UNknown UNknown UNknown
in UNknown UNknown UNknown law this is me in eight years
massachusetts attorney general
being sworn in as the youngest governor in u s history
wow you really thought that through
don 't you think it 's time you put childish things
behind you and thought this through yourself claire ?
i mean don 't let g e d be a lifestyle choice
i UNknown l tell you what
if you want i UNknown l help you make your own trajectory
it can be our project
we are 12 blocks out we 'r e on it
on it ?
look at this parking lot
we 'r e not going anywhere in this mess
oh you 'r e right
what are you doing ?
i 'm gonna hoof it
you 'r e crazy
you UNknown l never make it
UNknown i grew up out here
there 's always a shortcut
then we 'r e gonna be in class together
you and i are gonna keep each other on our UNknown toes
this is about UNknown
35 of you geniuses will be lucky enough
to get in this class
the rest you can try next semester
you each have 45 minutes
to solve this UNknown
i know it 's so easy
are you sweating ?
this class isn 't for me
nurse speaks over intercom
uh huh ?
and she had twin girls
yeah yeah yeah
you know you should stop by
they 'd like to thank you in person
i 'm good
if it was me i 'd be floating on cloud nine right now
what 's going on with you ?
if i would have showed up 30 seconds later
that woman her babies they 'd be dead
it 's too close man
i UNknown e gotta be faster
dude you got there faster than UNknown possible
if i was a religious man i 'd think it was a miracle
a miracle ?
took on a shift
yeah i know but james is sick
i figured i 'd cover for him
too late jackson 's already covering
dude there 's a life outside this place
now me and some of the guys are going out
UNknown 's still open come with us
i 'm good man
all four worked in building 26 UNknown 's men
these are revenge killings
i 'm sure it won 't be long
before she makes her way up that list to me
dragging your feet and pull the trigger
on this operation
i UNknown e given you time to put your personal life in order
and nathan says you 'r e avoiding his phone calls
by nathan you mean UNknown right ?
we UNknown e been over this noah
it 's all working exactly as planned
as planned ?
matt parkman had to turn UNknown into nathan
and as i recall you were in on it
i made an emotional decision
because i didn 't want to see you lose your son
but it was wrong
i can barely look him in the eye
knowing who 's under that skin
then don 't
you 'r e supposed to be the man with the plan remember ?
i 'm not sure i 'm that guy anymore
why is that ?
if you UNknown l excuse me
today is claire 's first day of college
and i 'm already late which doesn 't help the situation
throws phone on table
what i can 't figure out is how she survived
i put a bullet in her myself
she shattered into a thousand pieces of ice
that your being here isn 't a co UNknown
i 'm here to offer a solution to our mutual problem
you and i kill tracy strauss before she kills us
last time i made a deal with you you tried to stab me with a syringe
that makes us both wanted men
so what are you doing here ?
you ought to be hiding under a rock somewhere
just because the government stopped hunting these people doesn 't mean i have
i hear you and the UNknown you 'r e going back into business to do just that
no you heard wrong
i 'm changing careers
time to cash out
i 'm not like you
she 's coming back for you
you know that right ?
i guess you 'r e on your own
i guess i am
UNknown are a very subversive group
you don 't wanna mix with that crowd
oh so you know
they said that my cheers sounded more like UNknown
yeah that 's not good
uh i 'm gretchen berg
who are you ?
kind of all over the place
uh been in southern california for a while
but texas originally odessa
which claire bennet would that be ?
murder at union wells in odessa claire bennet
you heard about that ?
a UNknown in texas gets her head UNknown off at the homecoming game ?
yeah i UNknown e heard about that
you know i kind of want to keep the whole murder at union wells on the d l
no they won 't
oh why did you change it back ? UNknown UNknown i wanted to be claire bennet again
i thought people might forget
nice to meet you
took me a half hour to get here
i 'm sorry where are my manners ?
you look lovely as usual
miss UNknown we 'r e here
thank you alfred
took me a half an hour to get here
i 'm sorry
you look lovely
i 'm worried that noah might be UNknown
he 's been very distracted lately
i UNknown l talk to him don 't worry
do i like sushi ?
you 'r e the one who had a craving for UNknown
i wanted italian
it keeps you from getting stale
i UNknown e been taking stock of a lot of things
i feel like there 's a lot of
i don 't know mom
guess there 's a lot of change going on with me
it just seems like it 's not my life i 'm looking back on
does that make any sense ?
along with all sorts of other unpleasant surprises
i 'm being serious mom
look at the person i UNknown e been the kind of father
the kind of brother
you UNknown e been just fine under the circumstances
but i 'm gonna change all that
i 'm gonna UNknown with everybody in my life
who 's important and this time
i 'm gonna be a better me
and it 's bound to get confusing
and a man your age starts to feel his own UNknown
that 's just it
i feel invincible
here 's my suggestion
and a younger woman with questionable morals
that 's what your father did and it worked for him
phone continues ringing
we have a problem
that thing you did six weeks ago
you mean when you and bennet strong armed me
into playing god that thing ?
i think UNknown 's beginning to emerge again
that 's because he is UNknown
no you made UNknown go away
when you turned him into my son
i saw you do it
okay then why the hell are you calling me ?
because you need to fix it
you need to patch it up UNknown it
whatever it is you do
how exactly ?
that 's what you do
no not anymore i stopped
look ever since that day
i have felt like something got inside of me
and i can 't get it out
i started seeing things and i i UNknown e stopped okay ?
i 'm done
not for people like us
yeah speak for yourself
are you telling me you are not willing to fix our problem ?
this is not our problem
this is your problem
a really above average student if she just applied herself
i was having a little problem with my car
and annie was just um catching me up
oh she was ?
it was very nice to meet you mr bennet
maybe you can uh take that algebra class next semester
but see that is probably the least interesting part of my day
how so ?
well my name was
but they say college is for UNknown yourself
i don 't want to pretend to be anyone but me
i just wanna be claire bennet daughter of noah bennet
you know annie asked me today what my dad did for a living
and i actually told her the truth
and i like telling the truth
what if my way of UNknown myself is by telling the truth ?
the whole truth
his name is UNknown
i have a favor to ask of you edgar
can 't you send someone else this time ?
i 'd take it as a compliment to your unique skills
well what you said this morning about redemption i 'm hoping that 's possible
all of this
that 's where he comes in
but i UNknown e only killed when i UNknown e absolutely had to
the line 's been crossed
they crossed it not us
i need you to go to him get the compass back
and the kill the son of a bitch
that 's what joseph would have wanted
well joseph 's not here anymore
you know five 's my lucky number
is it still lucky ?
i haven 't decided yet
i saw you break into a thousand pieces and yet here you are
that is a neat trick
it wasn 't a trick
i felt myself shatter
killing all of you
because i don 't think that you 'r e really a killer
that 's not who you are
no that 's all i am
you took the rest away from me
i can help you get your life back
what if i could make it so that UNknown wasn 't interested in you anymore ?
why do you want to do this for me ?
20 years of UNknown and UNknown and i never helped a single one of you
maybe we 'r e both looking for redemption
what do you say ?
is it a deal ?
i got your phone call
change your mind about tracy strauss ?
even if i have to suck her up in a wet UNknown to do it
she murdered four of my men
she 's a killer
you said guys like us never start over
i 'm offering you a chance to do just that
consider it a permanent vacation
courtesy of the u s government
well we all want things bennet
and i 'm gonna get what i want
look i UNknown e left you
i UNknown e left you three messages
you need to call me back
something 's happening to me and i think you 'r e the only person who 's gonna understand what it is
it 's uh
you know exactly who i am
they sent you to get it back
he made you forget
it 's not worth it
now i 'm gonna get it back
you 'r e never gonna find it
i just it was so scandalous and i got excited
no no no no
so what you pretended like it didn 't happen ?
no i just kept trying to start my life over and i thought i could take what i liked about who i was and leave all the other stuff behind
whoo ! yeah !
you and me
who is she ?
that would be my roommate
come on we 'r e up
i was gonna play with gretchen
does gretchen know how to play ?
no but gretchen doesn 't care
not lower it
we UNknown l be on even playing fields
this is gonna be really bad
are we really going to stop moving after all these years ?
it 's time
but i need you to try and do it one more time
that 's good news samuel
how far ?
guess you 'r e still there
and you left the windows open
where 's UNknown ?
you put him down please
oh poor daddy
can you say freaking out ?
i don 't i don 't understand
how are you even here ?
i 'm part of you matt
whatever you did to me i held on
and now i 'm inside your head
so you 'r e not real ?
then how could i be holding your little boy ?
just put him down
you did something to me to my mind
that 's why i 'm here
tell me what you did what did you put in my body ?
okay just put him down and then we UNknown l talk about this
matt he 's fast asleep
i 'm just tired i guess
come back to bed
who were you looking for ?
i didn 't do it
what have you got to lose UNknown ?
do i know you ?
the name 's samuel
did your roommate express any suicidal thoughts feelings of being overwhelmed
low self esteem ?
she was an UNknown
what suicide note ?
no it wasn 't
no i distinctly remember being impressed with how crisp her UNknown was
and that there wasn 't a suicide note
this wasn 't there
you said she was an UNknown ?
look even an UNknown can 't write a suicide note after she 's dead
she wouldn 't do this
what then ?
i don 't know
yep it sure is
both speaking japanese
i have a gift UNknown
just like you
i 'm thinking it has something to do with that young man
is he you ?
why not ?
how i become the master of time and space
if i interfere i will never become a hero
i won 't save the UNknown
and new york will explode
it 's the butterfly effect
that you could change
no you can never change the past
it 's bad always
that 's all you do
change one thing
isn 't there anything else you 'd care to fix ?
the UNknown incident !
i bumped into UNknown and made him spill his drink
all over kimiko 's favorite dress
that is the reason why she started to hate him
now 's your chance to make them happy
you have the power
there are things in this world that are wrong UNknown
you can make them right
if you master these skills you and i will have a bright future together
you and me ?
both speaking japanese
the next thing i know he 's dead
and this guy is on me
i got lucky
it just it kicked in on instinct
what are you doing here tracy ?
i wanted you to leave UNknown to me
i couldn 't just let it go
i didn 't know if i could trust you to deal with him
this is my life
he didn 't know me
so i figured just live and let live
and as i was leaving this guy
the guy with the knives ?
he was fast
i think i heard him say he was looking for something
i don 't know maybe it was revenge
UNknown made a lot of enemies
this wasn 't revenge
if it were me and i was looking for revenge
i 'd go for the UNknown
or the UNknown artery or the heart
no i think you heard right
i think the killer was looking for something
that 's personal
what is that ?
come on UNknown man you can do it
show me you 'r e a big boy
did you see that ?
oh roy 's not a stranger
he 's been delivering water to us since UNknown was born
i can 't believe it 's been that long
time flies huh janice ?
i UNknown l swing by later to fix it
look when i delivered water we were professional
you never delivered water
the point is sighs
i thought we were past that
you haven 't been sleeping properly
well i UNknown e been snoring a lot less so
i 'm worried about you
it 's just work
and all i need is the name of the UNknown
and if you could read a few minds
yeah but i told you i 'm not UNknown that anymore right ?
i kicked that for good
i know and i 'm proud of you
i 'm just worried that it 's taking a toll
don 't worry
can i get you something to drink ?
water is good
i got my old job back
your mother says she hasn 't seen you in weeks
wow this is amazing
well in my line of work it helps to be uh
good for you
come on we haven 't exactly been model citizens noah
it 's a pretty heavy burden for one guy
you said you wanted to talk
now the way i figure it the guy that killed UNknown is probably just waiting for whoever shows up with this key
i need a partner on this somebody i can trust
he could jump me just about anywhere
and i 'd never know what hit me
cause he 's super fast and he has a thing for knives
how fast ?
not after what happened
i thought they should know about the supposed suicide letter
you didn 't say anything did you ?
no but i think they have the right to know don 't you ?
i mean if it were me you would want to know
it 's not your business to tell the parents about the note
let the police handle it
it 's the truth
so what do you think murder or UNknown accident ?
uh claire may have been mistaken about the note
may have been ?
well i didn 't at first but it was dark
maybe i missed it
who maps out their life for the next 50 years and then throws UNknown out a window ?
i should go
how do we prove it ?
so you think your knife guy 's gonna show ?
i don 't know but it sure makes me feel better having you around
yeah i UNknown l bet
do you mind if i make an observation ?
i think you should seriously consider how you 'r e living your life
where did that come from ?
i saw your apartment the police UNknown all those newspaper articles
you 'r e saving lives and you 'r e keeping track
i UNknown l bet you know every one of their names
it 's not healthy to live alone peter
no connections to anybody it 's a dead end
and now my kids are off at school and i 'm eating cereal for dinner and a strange man is answering my wife 's phone
my point is i 'm alone
that 's no way to live
knock on door
and i UNknown l be right outside when you 'r e finished
so what 'd we win ?
that doesn 't belong to you
he has power
oh he 's recovering
no not really
could i see it ?
i didn 't do anything
well apparently it only works for you
you saw that guy there could be others out there like him
look my life finally makes sense to me
in the last six weeks i have saved 53 people
i 'm with you for what ? an hour and some innocent guy almost gets killed ?
the further i stay away from you and whatever it is that you 'r e doing the happier i 'm gonna be
he murdered UNknown
so why don 't you just let him have it ?
so why 'd you come with me ?
the one where i actually save people
i guess this is good bye
i wish you all the luck in the world peter
thank you noah
is there such a place ?
don 't you think you 'r e going a little overboard ?
don 't you want to prove your roommate was UNknown ?
well don 't get mad at me for using it in a sentence
have you ever heard of the jump push fall test ?
the what ?
what page is that on ?
oh it 's not in there
if you jump you go a little further
but if you 'r e pushed clatter
you 'r e not serious
maybe we could swipe a cadaver from the medical school
what ? it 's a UNknown crime
let 's not get carried away
why not ?
mm the ship 's already sailed claire
so where do we get our hands on a dead body ?
hi my name 's matt
uh when i when i used
i was totally selfish
and uh how i may have hurt them
recently uh there have been these uh ghosts
these things have been popping up from my old life and haunting me
do you really think you 'r e gonna stop using your powers ?
are you crazy ?
you 'r e weak !
you 'r e UNknown !
i bet i could make you use your powers !
go away !
i 'm sorry
does this guy look okay seriously ?
i mean look
he 's like a heart attack waiting to happen !
stop it !
see if i can get him to talk
now you seemed a little off today at the meeting
no no no no no
i 'm good
just two guys talking come on
i get it
your UNknown all right ?
you give us that name you keep a clean record
he 's a liar totally lying
why are you looking at my forehead ?
does it say UNknown or something ?
i wasn 't staring at your forehead
you 'r e not getting a name coffee boy
is that all you need matt ?
a name ?
it 's got to be floating around in his comical little brain somewhere right ?
i don 't do that anymore
don 't do what anymore ?
why is that ?
leave me alone
just read his mind matt
you know you want to
i could help you
stop it !
just give me a name okay ?
take it from him !
leave me alone
shut the hell up
i 'm not talking to you right now
come on matt
and we both know what janice needs is a real man
someone who 's not afraid of power
someone who knows what to do with it
i 'm in control here not the power
and not you you son of a bitch !
lives in long beach okay ?
just leave me alone
yeah it was good
you okay ?
is that clam UNknown ?
this place called legal sea foods
i got one for you
never heard of it
i know a guy
all available units code three fifth and lexington
never mind that
siren grows louder
when you called i figured i owed it to you
hey you know that key inside of UNknown ?
it turns out it led me to a uh broken old compass
your friend with the knives
just came and took it back anyway
you gonna go after him ?
i don 't know
this new way just feels too
dangerous to try to stop them alone
maybe this guy with the knives is like me
just trying to get their life back
keeping what 's his
but to figure out a way to help them
you know i i can 't call my wife
my ex wife
so i just uh
you don 't want to be alone
yeah i guess not
um i i have no idea
what is it ?
looks like you have someone looking out for you
you want some ?
or else you UNknown l just bust the coil again
guess you don 't know your own strength
hey roy ?
oh sure thing see you tuesday janice

i can 't get hold of the mayor
well that 's your problem man that 's not mine !
that 's like
that 's the new york city 's problem !
get the fuck of the radio and notify the mayor mother fucker !
east harlem elementary at 2 30 you were supposed to read a cat in the hat to the third grade
everytime i go to the schools i get sick
they all have UNknown nose 's
call dr UNknown tell him
i want him waiting at the school with a flu shot
he 's in car 3

it 's not clear but i have a car waiting for us downstairs
the subway will get us there faster
tell the conductor this is now an express
we 'r e skipping the next 5 stops
hold on hold on
maybe he 's not such a UNknown after all huh ?
that 's funny !
the negotiating team will be here in 5 minutes and the mayor 's been notified

my shift 's over in 10 minutes
what are you staring at ?

i don 't know
well i can tell you that your dealing with one of the old time UNknown
i know that i mean it takes time
well then you better fix the UNknown because when the time comes these motherfuckers these hostages are gonna go real quick !
you got it
no i mean are you guys like terrorist 's ?
do i sound like a terrorist ?
do i UNknown you ?
actually you don 't but um not that i UNknown e ever talked to one
oh is there anything else ?
there 's not dying
where 's that jersey ?
yeah you watch it
no no i 'm just saying
you 'r e up in the UNknown 's cab so it means you know your on the radio which means that your an easy target
you gotta know the drill
yeah i know that soon i won 't be alone and if i 'm the first to get shot
i 'm the first of many to get shot !
that 's correct but then you UNknown l still be dead
death is an improvement on alot of things i can think of buddy boy !
sounds like he slept with my ex
you know we all owe god a death
i 'm a man who pays his debt 's are you a man who pay 's his debt 's ?
yeah yeah sure
that 's a little like dying once a month
this is only a part
oh you 'r e married !
you 'r e a married man
married men have mortgages
i don 't know garber
why don 't you tell me and then we UNknown l both know ?
i do not know
like i said your in the UNknown 's cab you got no covers cops on the way
you know circumstances are my protection
cause right now you know hostages are a good insurance by the way i see it
i 'm pretty well protected
you know this reminds me of being in a confession
are you a catholic ?
i 'm married are you a catholic ?
i mean you don 't want to kill innocent people do you ?
a good catholic knows that know body is innocent and i 'm not going to kill all these hostages and give up my UNknown
yeah well it 's running like a swiss watch down here
so don 't worry about it
so what do i call you anyway ?
call me ryder
call me with ryder with a y
i do like you man
you may be the last friend i ever make
well i hope your wrong mr ryder
but uh you know i 'm just a guy
i 'm just a guy on the other end of the mike
oh you don 't think this was meant to be ? you don 't think this was fate you and me ?
i don 't know you know things happen that lead to other things and maybe this was one of them but a thats it
i never get excited about coincidence
